  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>With Intimidate and a good defensive typing, Qwilfish can check several physical threats in UU, such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Entei. Qwilfish has access to a plethora of utility moves, including Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Taunt, Thunder Wave, Scald, Destiny Bond, and Explosion, in addition to semi-reliable recovery in Pain Split. Not only does Qwilfish have the tools for a defensive utility set, but it can also pull off an offensive Swift Swim set on dedicated rain teams as a wallbreaker with Swords Dance, Explosion, and Destiny Bond, as well as work as a Toxic Spikes absorber. Qwilfish is relatively fast for both a defensive Pokemon and a Swift Swim user. However, its terrible special bulk leaves it very vulnerable to most special attackers. Qwilfish is also rather prone to being worn down easily, especially considering many of the Pokemon it checks carry Knock Off or U-turn. In addition, Qwilfish's defensive set suffers from four-moveslot syndrome.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A suicide lead set with Focus Sash, maximum Speed, and Explosion is plausible, but Qwilfish is too slow to reliably perform its job against opposing leads such as Froslass and Aerodactyl. Qwilfish can use Aqua Jet to pick off frail and weakened foes outside of the rain, but it is too weak and comes with the cost of not using one of its other moves. Qwilfish also has access to Destiny Bond to bring down a foe with it, which is useful against Pokemon that it cannot KO with Explosion. Icy Wind is an option to punish Haxorus's attempts to set up on Qwilfish and allow Qwilfish's teammates to more easily deal with other boosting sweepers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Qwilfish's horrible special bulk, Pokemon such as Chandelure and Nidoqueen can easily threaten to KO it. Mega Blastoise can OHKO Qwilfish and Rapid Spin its entry hazards away. Shaymin and Roserade can also OHKO Qwilfish and do not fear Waterfall, Scald, or Thunder Wave thanks to their typings and Natural Cure, while the latter can absorb Qwilfish's Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Heliolisk, Rotom-C, and Mega Ampharos are all immune to Thunder Wave and can easily OHKO Qwilfish.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Attacks</strong>: Qwilfish's Swift Swim set is vulnerable to being revenge killed by powerful priority attacks such as Entei's Extreme Speed and Honchkrow's Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Some Bulky Water-types</strong>: Seismitoad and Jellicent can give Qwilfish some trouble, as both are immune to Waterfall and resist Poison Jab. The former is immune to Thunder Wave and can threaten Qwilfish with Earthquake or Earth Power, while the latter is immune to Explosion.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Qwilfish can set up either Spikes or Toxic Spikes, punishing switches and racking up residual damage, and can easily take advantage of its bulk and typing to do so against opposing Fighting-, Fire-, and Fairy-types. Waterfall prevents Qwilfish from becoming Taunt fodder and is decently powerful backed by a STAB boost and Qwilfish's base 95 Attack. Scald can be used over Waterfall for its chance to burn as well as its consistent damage if Qwilfish is burned; however, Qwilfish's pitiful base 55 Special Attack means that Scald is significantly weaker than Waterfall, and Scald can also cause an unwanted burn on Guts Heracross. Taunt prevents slower Defog users such as Empoleon from removing Qwilfish's entry hazards, stops walls such as Suicune and Florges from recovering their health, and prevents setup from the likes of Snorlax and Feraligatr. Pain Split is Qwilfish's best form of recovery and allows it to stay healthy enough to repeatedly switch into physical attackers and Fairy-types. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can be used to cripple certain switch-ins and is especially useful against faster Defog users, such as Crobat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and nature maximize Qwilfish's physical bulk to allow it to easily switch into Pokemon such as Mienshao, Mega Beedrill, and Infernape. An Impish nature should be used with Waterfall, while a Bold nature should be used with Scald. Intimidate further augments Qwilfish's physical bulk. Black Sludge provides Qwilfish with passive recovery and deters Choice item users from using Trick.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch into physical Fire- and Fighting-type attackers as well as Fairy-types and take advantage of Qwilfish's ability to wall these Pokemon by setting up entry hazards early in the game. Wear down opposing Defog and Rapid Spin users with Thunder Wave and Waterfall or Scald.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Qwilfish should be paired with special walls to take the special attacks directed at Qwilfish. Sylveon, Florges and Umbreon fulfill this role while also helping Qwilfish stay healthy with Wish support, and both appreciate Qwilfish's ability to take on powerful physical attackers such as Entei. Porygon2 can also handle Pokemon that threaten Qwilfish, such as Heliolisk, while Qwilfish can check the Fighting-types that give Porygon2 trouble; Snorlax offers similar synergy and can also rack up Spikes damage with Whirlwind. Krookodile has great synergy with Qwilfish, as it can check Electric- and Psychic-types, provide Stealth Rock support to aid in wearing down foes, and threaten common Defog users such as Crobat and Empoleon. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Swords Dance Heracross have an easier time KOing defensive targets with Spikes support. Cleaners such as Mega Sharpedo, Lucario, and Slurpuff can all make use of Qwilfish's Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Swift Swim": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance turns Qwilfish into a powerful wallbreaker, allowing it to do major damage to defensive Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Forretress, and Suicune. Waterfall and Poison Jab are Qwilfish's most powerful and reliable STAB attacks. Waterfall additionally benefits from a boost in the rain, while Poison Jab hits many common threats to rain teams, such as Chesnaught, Hydreigon, and Mega Abomasnow. Explosion serves as a last-ditch effort to do major damage to opposing walls and also allows Qwilfish's teammates to come onto the field for free. For example, at +2, Qwilfish OHKOes Suicune with Explosion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread enables Qwilfish to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature is used for the extra power, as a Jolly nature does not allow Qwilfish to outspeed anything significant in the rain. Life Orb is the preferred item to further boost Qwilfish's power, while Swift Swim doubles Qwilfish's Speed in the rain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring in Qwilfish under rain early in the game to muscle through physical walls. Use Explosion when Qwilfish is about to faint to safely bring in another rain abuser, such as Mega Swampert, or a rain setter. However, preserve Qwilfish against opposing teams with Toxic Spikes setters, as Qwilfish's teammates will appreciate having them absorbed later in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Reliable manual rain setters are necessary to activate Qwilfish's Swift Swim. Bronzong and Tornadus are both excellent setters of rain and can bring in Qwilfish with Explosion and U-turn, respectively. Other Swift Swim abusers, such as Kingdra and Mega Swampert, can make good use of Qwilfish's ability to put holes in defensive cores and can safely clean up afterwards. Entry hazard support helps Qwilfish net KOs on Pokemon such as Mega Aggron.</p>"

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Entei received a massive buff when it received Sacred Fire, one of the most beneficial attacks in the game. Thanks to Sacred Fire's STAB boost, and amazing 50% chance to burn, even supposed checks will have a hard time switching into Entei, factoring in possible entry hazards and burn damage. Entei's access to Extreme Speed makes it a fantastic late-game cleaner, and its solid bulk and a decent base 100 Speed allows it to outspeed common walls such as Chesnaught and Cresselia. These factors combine to make Entei one of the most threatening wallbreakers in the tier. However, Entei is plagued with a vulnerability to every form of entry hazard, including the very common Stealth Rock, and no reliable recovery, making it unable to switch in multiple times. Its Speed stat, while decent, is also nothing spectacular, especially considering that Entei is forced to run an Adamant nature to use Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Entei has a somewhat shallow movepool, so it does not have many other decent options. Iron Head is noteworthy, as it lets Entei get super effective hits on Diancie and other assorted Rock-types, which otherwise have no trouble taking its attacks. A specially attacking Calm Mind set can be used to surprise physical walls, and with the ability to create large Substitutes, it can even set up on special walls that rely on Seismic Toss such as Blissey. Natural Gift alongside a Liechi Berry gives Entei a powerful Grass-type attack to surprise bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert and Suicune with, but this relies heavily on the element of surprise, and the damage difference without Choice Band is notable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Suicune can switch into any of Entei's moves and recover off the damage with Rest, Wish, and other recovery moves.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock and Spikes wear down Entei very quickly, and it without team support, Entei can't recover any entry hazard damage it takes.</p> <p><strong>Diancie</strong>: Diancie takes very little damage from Sacred Fire, can set up Stealth Rock to wear Entei down, and can even use Heal Bell to heal off Sacred Fire burns.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire Users</strong>: Pokemon with Flash Fire, such as Chandelure, can switch in to Choice-locked Entei and get a boost in the process</p> <p><strong>Curse Snorlax</strong>: Curse Snorlax can eat up Sacred Fire due to Thick Fat and can use Rest to heal off the damage and burn.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Jolly Krookodile can easily revenge kill Entei. However, both fear Sacred Fire burns, so they cannot freely switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sacred Fire is Entei's most dangerous move, with high power and an excellent chance to burn that allows it to punish bulky Water-type Pokemon that try to switch in. Flare Blitz has more PP and a sizable power boost, but its recoil damage can limit Entei's longevity. Extreme Speed is a priority move and can pick off weakened and faster foes such as Mega Beedrill and Crobat after they have taken Stealth Rock damage. Stone Edge targets Flash Fire users and opposing Fire-type Pokemon such as Arcanine and Chandelure.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is required, as Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz are event-only moves. Choice Band is the preferred item, maximizing Entei's attack, although Life Orb can be used for the ability to switch moves but gives Entei slightly less power. Maximum Attack EVs are for maximum damage output, while the Speed EVs let Entei outspeed everything up to max Speed Rotom-formes, excluding base.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unless the opponent has a Flash Fire user, Entei's best bet is to spam Sacred Fire. Even checks and counters to Entei don't appreciate the residual damage from a burn combined with possible damage from entry hazards. Sacred Fire's 95% accuracy can cause issues, and it also has limited PP, so Pokemon such as Suicune, which has Pressure, can easily PP stall Entei's Sacred Fire. Because of this, you should also be wary of Flash Fire users such as Chandelure. Don't switch Entei in and out often while Stealth Rock is present on your side of the field, as the combination of Life Orb recoil, if it is being used, and entry hazards wear Entei down extremely fast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Powerful Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Ampharos and Celebi are handy for dealing with the bulky Water-types that give Entei trouble. Mega Blastoise and Empoleon can force out Rock-types and clear entry hazards with Rapid Spin and Defog, respectively. Entry hazard setters such as Krookodile make Entei's job easier, as entry hazard damage and burn damage quickly wear down Entei's switch ins. Pursuit support from the likes of Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl can eliminate Flash Fire users such as Chandelure, allowing Entei to spam Sacred Fire more freely.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune is one of the most centralizing Pokemon in the UnderUsed metagame, and for good reason. Suicune has access to amazing natural bulk backed by a solid defensive typing, making it one of the sturdiest walls in the tier. Suicune's defensive qualities are further augmented by Pressure, an ability that allows Suicune to outlast a lot of Pokemon that would otherwise wall it with ease, such as Blissey. Suicune also has access to Calm Mind and Scald, as well as decent Special Attack and Speed, allowing it to have good offensive presence for a defensive-minded Pokemon.</p> <p>Despite having so many positives, Suicune lacks access to reliable recovery, forcing it to rely on Rest for good longevity throughout a match. Suicune is also very reliant on its STAB attacks for damage, making it vulnerable to Pokemon that have an immunity to Water-type attacks, such as Dry Skin Heliolisk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Suicune can utilize a Rest set with Chesto Berry to not waste any turns asleep, but using Chesto Berry means that Suicune is unable to hold Leftovers, decreasing its longevity. Suicune can also use Toxic to spread status, but it generally doesn't have the space to use the move on any moveset. Mirror Coat is an interesting option that allows Suicune to defeat special attackers that generally deal a lot of damage to it but cannot OHKO it; however, like Toxic, Mirror Coat generally doesn't fit on any moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Water-type Attacks</strong>: Pokemon that have an ability that makes them immune to Water-type attacks, such as Dry Skin Toxicroak, Water Absorb Jellicent, and Dry Skin Heliolisk, can easily switch into Suicune's STAB attacks and either force it out or beat it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Grass-types</strong>: Most offensive Grass-type Pokemon in the UnderUsed tier can easily beat Suicune with their super effective STAB attacks. Roserade and Celebi get special mentions for switching into Suicune without worry, as they both have access to reliable recovery and Natural Cure, which can remove any Scald burns simply by switching out. These Pokemon do have to be wary of a potential Ice Beam, however.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types can easily cripple Suicune with their powerful STAB attacks. Heliolisk and Rotom-C get special mentions, as the former is immune to Suicune's STAB attacks and the latter resists them.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Calm Mind Users</strong>: Specially bulky Calm Mind users, such as Reuniclus and Slowking, can easily beat most Suicune sets one-on-one, but they are unable to beat Roar variants of Suicune unless they're the last Pokemon on their team.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze Users</strong>: Pokemon with access to Haze or phazing moves, such as Haze Tentacruel and Dragon Tail Slowking, can easily remove any boosts that Suicune has accumulated.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Switcheroo Users</strong>: Pokemon that commonly run Trick or Switcheroo, such as Porygon-Z and Whimsicott, can cripple Suicune with a Choice item for the rest of the match.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "RoarCune": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roar allows Suicune to phaze the opposing Pokemon; it prevents setup sweepers from setting up, racks up entry hazard damage on the opposing Pokemon, and usually prevents Suicune itself from being phazed should it attempt a sweep. Scald is a very consistent STAB attack with a good chance to burn the opposing Pokemon. Sleep Talk ensures that Suicune is less passive during sleep turns, as it has a 66% chance to select either Scald or Roar, deterring most Pokemon from attempting to use Suicune as setup fodder. Lastly, Calm Mind is an option, as it boosts Suicune's Special Attack and Special Defense, allowing it to function as a dangerous setup sweeper.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides Suicune with a source of passive recovery, which it greatly appreciates, as it is reliant on Rest for recovery. The given EVs maximize Suicune's physical bulk, allowing it to take on the many dangerous physical attackers in the tier, such as Feraligatr and Mamoswine. When running Roar without Sleep Talk, running some speed may be worthwhile in order to phaze opposing Suicune.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The way this set is played varies depending on whether Sleep Talk or Calm Mind is chosen in the last moveslot. Should the former be chosen, Suicune works exceptionally well on stall teams as a check to various threatening physical attackers and setup sweepers, such as Swords Dance Feraligatr and Curse Snorlax. Should the latter be chosen, however, Suicune helps its team with role compression by being able to fulfill the role of a bulky setup sweeper as well as a good, albeit softer, check to the physical attackers and setup sweepers previously mentioned. Regardless of which move is chosen, Suicune should generally be capitalizing on the switches it forces by either phazing the incoming Pokemon to rack up entry hazard damage or attacking the incoming Pokemon with Scald to try to burn it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types, such as Nidoqueen and Gligar, are immune to the Electric-type attacks usually aimed at Suicune while Suicune resists the Ice- and Water-type attacks aimed at those Ground-types. Ground-types are also commonly used as entry hazard setters, making them even better partners to Suicune by helping it wear down its foes. Ground-types do not resist Grass-type attacks, however, and some Ground-types are weak to them, so be sure to have a Pokemon resistant to Grass when pairing Suicune with a Ground-type. Grass-types resist both of Suicune's weaknesses, and Suicune resists two of their weaknesses in Fire and Ice. Roserade and Chesnaught get special mentions, as they are able to set up Spikes for Suicune. Suicune forces many switches by virtue of its ability to phaze opposing Pokemon, so entry hazard setters, such as Cobalion and Mega Aggron, are good partners. Toxic Spikes users, such as Tentacruel and Dragalge, can cripple many of Suicune's checks and counters as they switch in. Should Calm Mind be used in the fourth moveslot, clerics, such as Florges and Umbreon, make for excellent partners, as they can wake Suicune up after it uses Rest, preventing it wasting turns.</p>"
      },
      "CroCune": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind makes Suicune a terrifying bulky setup sweeper, as it boosts not only Suicune's Special Attack but also its Special Defense. Scald is a consistent STAB attack that also has a good chance to burn the foe, allowing Suicune to have an easier time against powerful physical attackers. Rest gives Suicune a form of instant recovery that not only heals it to full HP but also removes any status conditions. Sleep Talk ensures that Suicune isn't useless when it's asleep. Ice Beam is also an option in the fourth moveslot, giving Suicune super effective coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types while also having good neutral coverage in conjunction with Scald.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Suicune passive recovery, thus increasing its longevity. A Bold nature is used in tandem with the given EVs to maximize Suicune's physical bulk while also maintaining good special bulk. Pressure allows Suicune to outlast most defensive Pokemon that could otherwise easily wall this set, such as Blissey.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Suicune should constantly apply pressure to the opposing team either by repeatedly using Scald to wear down its checks and counters or by posing as a constant threat by setting up against teams that don't have a solid answer to it. Suicune should only attempt to sweep once its checks and counters are either removed or weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass- and Dragon-types, such as Virizion and Hydreigon, resist both Grass- and Electric-type attacks. As Grass-types can take on most Pokemon immune to Water, they are usually better teammates than Dragon-types. Roserade gets a special mention for being able to set Toxic Spikes, which ensures Water Absorb Jellicent isn't able to check Suicune. Suicune's main checks are Electric-types, making Ground-types, such as Nidoking and Nidoqueen, good partners. Ground-types, especially specially defensive Gligar, also deal with Toxicroak and Heliolisk, which are both premier Suicune checks, with ease. Special walls, such as Blissey and Florges, are able to take on special attackers that Suicune can struggle with, while Suicune is able to take on the physical attackers that these special walls have trouble against in return. Due to Suicune's ability to force many switches, entry hazard setters, such as Forretress, are good teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Suicune's Special Attack and Special Defense, making it a threatening special sweeper. Hydro Pump is a powerful, albeit unreliable, STAB attack. Scald, on the other hand, is a less powerful but consistent STAB attack that also has a chance to burn the foe. Ice Beam has good coverage in tandem with Suicune's STAB attack of choice, hitting Dragon-, and Grass-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Tailwind allows Suicune to sweep past more offensively oriented teams, and support its teammates by giving them a Speed boost. Hidden Power Electric gives Suicune super effective coverage against Water-types. Extrasensory is also an option in the fourth moveslot to hit Toxicroak, a common Suicune check, for super effective damage. Lastly, Hidden Power Grass is an option to hit Swampert and Seismitoad for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Suicune's damage output and Speed, and a Timid nature is used to ensure Suicune is able to outspeed some important threats in the metagame, including Mamoswine, Feraligatr, and Chandelure. Leftovers gives Suicune a form of passive recovery, thus extending its longevity. An alternative EV spread consisting of 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe with a Modest nature is also usable for Tailwind variants, as this EV spread gives Suicune more bulk to be able to set up Tailwind, and the given Speed EVs allow Suicune to outspeed Mega Aerodactyl under Tailwind.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Suicune should only attempt to sweep after all its checks and counters have been either significantly weakened or removed. Depending on its moves, these checks and counters vary. For instance, Vaporeon can easily outlast most variants of this set. However, if running Hidden Power Electric in the fourth moveslot, this set can easily use Vaporeon as setup bait and proceed to sweep the opposing team. This set is also, for the most part, unexpected, so it can be used to lure in threats that commonly switch in on Suicune, such as Rotom-C and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Heracross and Choice Specs Kyurem, weaken walls, thus allowing Suicune to sweep more easily. Sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Haxorus and Swords Dance Lucario, can capitalize on Suicune's ability to weaken the opposing team. Due to Suicune's ability to force many switches, entry hazard setters, such as Empoleon and Krookodile, are helpful teammates. Suicune is weak to Grass- and Electric-type attacks, so Dragon-types and Grass-types, such as Hydreigon and Whimsicott, respectively, can switch in on those attacks.</p>"
      },
      "SubCM": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Suicune to safely set up Calm Minds and scout the foe's moves. Calm Mind allows Suicune to become a threatening setup sweeper, as it boosts Suicune's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage. Scald is a consistent STAB attack that deals decent damage and also has a good chance to burn the foe. Roar allows Suicune to phaze the foe, thus preventing Suicune from being beaten by other bulky setup sweepers and Pokemon from attempting to set up on Suicune. Ice Beam provides excellent coverage alongside Scald, hitting most Pokemon that resist Scald for either neutral or super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and nature give Suicune great bulk, particularly physically, while ensuring that it is able to outspeed up to neutral-natured base 71 Speed Pokemon, which include Adamant Tyrantrum and Modest Hoopa. Leftovers gives Suicune a form of recovery, mitigating the HP loss from using Substitute. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe can be used should more bulk be preferred over Speed. Another alternative EV spread is 252 HP / 112 SpA / 144 Spe with a Modest nature, which should be used if more offensive prowess is favored over increased bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Suicune should be sent in against Pokemon that cannot threaten it much, such as Darmanitan and Doublade, and proceed to use them as opportunities to set up Substitute or Calm Mind. Before attempting to sweep with Suicune, be sure to weaken or remove its checks and counters. Suicune can weaken some of its own checks and counters through the use of the move in the fourth moveslot. Should Roar be used, Suicune can capitalize on predicted switches into one of its checks or counters and phaze it out, racking up entry hazard damage on the opposing team. Should Ice Beam be used, however, Suicune can capitalize on the safety of being behind a Substitute when one of its checks or counters weak to Ice is sent in and weaken or KO that switch-in with Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters, such as Bronzong and Mega Camerupt, make for good Suicune partners, as Suicune appreciates their ability to wear down the opposing team with their entry hazards. Wish users with clerical moves, such as Sylveon and Blissey, also make for good Suicune teammates, as this Suicune set lacks any form of non-Leftovers recovery and a way to remove status conditions. Suicune needs to have the opposing team weakened before it can attempt a sweep, making wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Tyrantrum and Choice Band Darmanitan, good partners. Suicune is only weak to Grass- and Electric-type attacks, so Pokemon that resist both of those types, such as Goodra and Roserade, are good partners.</p>"

  "Weezing": {
    "overview": "<p>Don't underestimate Weezing; thanks to its solid mono-Poison typing, Levitate, and high Defense, it is a very reliable physical wall in the UU tier. Its resistance to Fighting-type moves is especially useful, as the tier is filled with offensive Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Lucario, Infernape, and Machamp. Thanks to Weezing's decent Special Attack and access to Will-O-Wisp, it is not setup bait like most dedicated walls are. Couple that with Weezing's ability to wall foes and provide some momentum at the same time, and it makes for a solid choice on your stall or balance team.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Weezing's low Special Defense allows special attackers to shut it down completely. Weezing also lacks reliable recovery, which is detrimental to its capabilities as a wall, as Pain Split can only help so much. Its low Speed also means that it'll nearly always have to take a hit before it is able to do anything.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Explosion can deal solid damage as a last resort and prevent a spinner or Defogger from removing Weezing's Toxic Spikes. Thunderbolt is an interesting option to surprise Feraligatr and Mega Aerodactyl. Fire Blast is more powerful than Flamethrower, but Flamethrower is the more consistent option due to its higher PP and perfect accuracy. Clear Smog can be used over Haze in order to get past Taunt users. However, Clear Smog is blocked by Substitute and Steel-types. Memento assists a teammate with setting up, though Weezing has better things to do than sacrifice itself. Memento is, however, a decent move to use once Weezing is low on health. Toxic alongside Protect can stall out foes, but Weezing lacks room for the move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Weezing's only weakness is to the Psychic-type. Reuniclus is Weezing's biggest threat because it is immune to any status that Weezing may inflict on it and can repeatedly set up with Calm Mind in Weezing's face. Other Psychic-types such as Espeon can also force Weezing to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Chandelure</strong>: Chandelure is Weezing's second biggest threat after Reuniclus. Chandelure can get a Flash Fire boost by switching into Weezing's Flamethrower or Will-O-Wisp, resists Sludge Bomb, and can repeatedly set up on Weezing with Substitute and Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Because Weezing is not very specially bulky, powerful special attackers such as Chandelure, Porygon-Z, and Hydreigon can deal serious damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Fast Taunt Users</strong>: Fast Pokemon with access to Taunt, such as Crobat, Tornadus, Mega Aerodactyl, and Krookodile, can shut down most of Weezing's moves and force it out of the battlefield.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: If Weezing is not carrying Haze, bulky setup sweepers such as Suicune can set up on Weezing with ease. Even if Weezing has Haze, the foe can hit Weezing hard as it tries to use the move.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Empoleon is immune to Toxic Spikes, can use Defog to remove Weezing's Toxic Spikes, and forces out Weezing with the threat of Scald. Mega Blastoise can also remove Toxic Spikes and threaten Weezing with a fully invested STAB Scald, but Mega Blastoise dislikes being poisoned. Grounded Poison-types such as Dragalge and Nidoking can remove Toxic Spikes simply by switching in and then proceed to hit Weezing with a powerful special attack.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Espeon and Mega Absol can bounce back Weezing's Toxic Spikes and Will-O-Wisp, making it a liability.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes poisons foes as they switch in, making them easier to wear down. Sludge Bomb prevents Weezing from becoming setup bait and allows it to inflict poison on foes without using Toxic Spikes. Alternatively, Flamethrower can be used to directly punish Steel-types, such as Mega Aggron, Forretress, and Cobalion. It is especially useful to prevent Substitute + Swords Dance Cobalion from setting up on Weezing. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers that attempt to use Weezing as setup bait. Pain Split is Weezing's best option for recovery, while Haze makes foes unable to try to set up against Weezing. Alternatively, Taunt is an option to stallbreak against opposing walls, though Weezing is too slow to use the move reliably.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature allows Weezing to take on several physical attackers in the UU tier. If running Taunt, 44 EVs in Speed can be used to hit uninvested Chesnaught and Umbreon with Taunt, preventing them from stalling out Weezing. Black Sludge gives Weezing passive recovery, allowing it to remain on the battlefield for a bit longer. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet can punish physical attackers and Knock Off users, but Weezing needs its reliable recovery and becomes overly reliant on Pain Split. Levitate removes Weezing's Ground weakness and allows it to switch in on Ground-type attacks and Spikes without worry.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Weezing works best as an early- and mid-game wall. To get it in safely and successfully, pivot Weezing into powerful physical attacks to absorb the hit and stifle opposing momentum. Be sure to use it to deal with many threatening physical sweepers, including boosting ones such as Feraligatr and Lucario. In most cases, set up Toxic Spikes on the predicted switch. However, if you suspect that the opponent will bring in a wall, cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. If you predict the opponent will switch in a Steel-type, nail it with Flamethrower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive clerics such as Umbreon, Blissey, Vaporeon, and Florges make for perfect teammates. They give Weezing a more reliable method of recovery than Pain Split and can take the special attacks that it has trouble surviving. Dark-, Ghost-, and Bug-types, such as Mega Absol, Doublade, and Mega Beedrill, respectively, can nail the Psychic-types that give Weezing trouble, such as Espeon and Reuniclus. Dark-types also appreciate Weezing's ability to counter Fighting- and Fairy-types. Pursuit trappers such as Escavalier and Krookodile can nail Psychic-types that attempt to switch out, giving Weezing an easier time walling the opposing team. Ground-types such as Donphan and Mamoswine can take out the grounded Poison-types that try to remove Weezing's Toxic Spikes. In return, Weezing can switch into the Grass-type attacks aimed at its Ground-type teammates. Setup sweepers such as Haxorus and Mega Sharpedo appreciate Weezing crippling their offensive checks with Will-O-Wisp, giving them an easier time setting up. A spinblocker such as Doublade can prevent opposing spinners from removing the Toxic Spikes that Weezing sets up. All-out attackers such as Kyurem, Pangoro, and Hydreigon enjoy having their defensive checks worn down by Toxic Spikes as well.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Gardevoir's superb Special Attack stat in combination with its fantastic offensive typing leaves it as one of the most ferocious special attackers in the UU tier. With access to great coverage options, such as Focus Blast and Shadow Ball, it becomes quite hard to switch into for all different archetypes. Its decent Speed tier allows it to outpace the likes of Florges and unboosted Feraligatr and Speed tie with Mamoswine and Chandelure; however, against offensive teams, it can be quite lacking. With high Special Defense for an offensive Pokemon, Gardevoir is able to soak up special attacks from the likes of Suicune and Florges quite easily. Last but certainly not least, Gardevoir's access to Trace allows it to copy the foe's ability, which is extremely helpful for foes with abilities such as Regenerator, Flash Fire, Swift Swim, and Sheer Force.</p> <p>Sadly, Gardevoir has terrible Defense, leaving it open to easy revenge killing from the likes of Entei, Mega Absol, Crobat, Mega Aerodactyl, and Krookodile. On top of that, it has a lot of issues breaking past certain Steel-type Pokemon depending on its coverage. For example, Doublade fears nothing except Shadow Ball, and Mega Aggron uses it as entry hazard setting fodder unless it has Focus Blast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt prevents the likes of Suicune and Florges from healing or setting up against Gardevoir; however, Gardevoir has difficulty fitting it on a moveset due to it being terrible to be locked into. Will-O-Wisp cripples certain physical switch-ins, most notably Krookodile and Doublade. Wish gives Gardevoir some means of recovery, but a low base HP stat prevents it from effectively passing health onto other teammates and leaves it generally outdone by Florges. Thunder Wave cripples faster Pokemon, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Gyarados, Alakazam, and Mega Houndoom. Energy Ball gives Gardevoir a solid way to OHKO Mega Swampert, which it can't normally do, but has limited uses outside this specific niche. Calm Mind Gardevoir can run a Choice Scarf, as being able to lock Pokemon such as Blissey and Gligar into their support moves can give it more setup opportunities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Depending on what coverage moves Gardevoir carries or is locked into, certain Steel-types are comfortably able to check it. For example, if Gardevoir is lacking Focus Blast, Mega Aggron can take it on quite easily, and if Gardevoir is lacking Shadow Ball, Doublade is able to set up Swords Dance against it. Escavalier is a hard counter due to its typing and defenses, and specially defensive Forretress is able to switch into every attack Gardevoir can throw at it with the exception of Modest Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast, which is able to 2HKO it. It also dislikes being Tricked a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Gardevoir's middling Speed tier, Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill, Cobalion, Mega Absol, Mega Aerodactyl, and Crobat can all easily revenge kill a weakened Gardevoir, as long as it is not using a Choice Scarf. Certain offensive Pokemon, such as Cobalion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Alakazam, can survive an attack from a Choice Scarf Gardevoir if need be.</p> <p><strong>Being Choice-locked</strong>: Depending on what Gardevoir is locked into on Choiced sets, certain Pokemon can come in to defeat it easily after sacrificing something. Being locked into Moonblast makes it vulnerable to Steel-types, being locked into Psyshock makes it vulnerable to Dark-type Pokemon and by extension Pursuit, and so on.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is a solid STAB attack, easily defeating Dark-types such as Mega Absol and Krookodile. Psychic is preferred over Psyshock, since the higher Base Power is generally more useful, as Choice Scarf Gardevoir lacks the pure power to break past Blissey and Florges. Healing Wish sacrifices Gardevoir, removing status from and healing the next teammate that switches in. This is especially useful for sweepers such as Mega Absol, Mega Houndoom, Gyarados, and Lucario, as all of them are crippled by status and some are weak to entry hazards. Memento makes Gardevoir faint while harshly lowering the foe's attacking stats. Similarly to Healing Wish, this paves the way for setup sweepers, as they essentially get a free turn. Trick cripples bulkier walls, especially the likes of Blissey and Florges, which Gardevoir can't break through on its own. Focus Blast is a mediocre move to be locked into; however, it does massive damage to opposing Steel-types such as Cobalion and Empoleon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack gives Gardevoir as much offensive prowess as possible. A Timid nature with maximum Speed investment allows Gardevoir to outpace most of the unboosted metagame and Speed tie with Choice Scarf Chandelure or base 80 Speed Pokemon if its Choice Scarf is removed. A Choice Scarf boosts its mediocre Speed tier and allows it to revenge kill Krookodile, Mega Houndoom, and Mega Swampert in the rain. However, it misses out on outspeeding Mega Beedrill and Mega Sceptile. Trace copies the foe's ability, which is extremely helpful against the likes of Chandelure and Mega Swampert.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Gardevoir is not meant to break down bulky walls. It best serves as a revenge killer against offensive teams and can heavily support teammates thanks to its access to Memento, Trick, and Healing Wish. Due to Gardevoir's relative frailty, be wary of sending it out against an opposing Pokemon at full health or directly in to attacks, as strong hits can KO it quite easily. Memento and Healing Wish provide huge opportunities for teammates to sweep, but the moves need to be used at the correct time to have their full effect. Gardevoir's access to Trace is incredible against foes such as Chandelure, Alomomola, and Crawdaunt, so take advantage of this whenever possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Krookodile, Swords Dance Feraligatr, Hydreigon, and Mamoswine excel at breaking down bulkier walls that Gardevoir lacks the power to easily defeat. Fire- and Dark-types such as Entei, Infernape, Mega Houndoom, and Mega Absol have the capability to defeat a large majority of Gardevoir's checks, especially Doublade and Mega Aggron. Steel-types and Dragon-types such as Doublade, Empoleon, Cobalion, and Hydreigon form a Dragon / Fairy / Steel core with Gardevoir, creating fantastic synergy. Slow Volt Switch or U-turn support from Pokemon such as Rotom-C, Forretress, and Gligar allows Gardevoir to switch in safely, as its frailty can make it difficult to switch directly into attacks. Pursuit support from Krookodile or Mega Absol quickly wears down a huge portion of Gardevoir's checks and counters, allowing it to break through them later on.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Gardevoir's Special Attack and Special Defense stats, allowing it to tear through slower teams while becoming quite specially bulky. Moonblast is a hard-hitting STAB attack that targets Dark-types while having good offensive synergy with Psyshock. Psyshock heavily damages the likes of Blissey and Florges, which rely on their high Special Defense to check special attackers. Substitute lets Gardevoir dodge status effects, such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, and is fantastic against stall teams, as Pokemon on those teams often lack the offensive presence to break Gardevoir's Substitute. Focus Blast obliterates Steel-type Pokemon, such as Aggron, Empoleon, and Cobalion. Alternatively, Shadow Ball allows Gardevoir to deal heavy damage to Doublade, Metagross, and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment takes full advantage of Gardevoir's high base Special Attack. Maximum Speed in tandem with a Timid nature allows Gardevoir to outpace everything up to opposing base 80 Speed Pokemon, which it Speed ties with. Leftovers gives Gardevoir passive recovery, which is helpful when using Substitute. Life Orb gives Gardevoir much more firepower; however, it gets worn down quite quickly with Substitute and recoil. Trace is its most useful ability, being able to copy abilities such as Flash Fire, Sheer Force, and Prankster.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind Gardevoir performs best against slower teams that rely on defensive prowess to stall out foes. Once it has properly set up, very few things can prevent it from sweeping teams. Against offensive teams, however, Gardevoir can often struggle. It's best not to set up against teams that have multiple ways to revenge kill it, as getting decent damage off proves more valuable in the end. Trace is a fantastic ability and one that Gardevoir should take advantage of. It truly shines against Pokemon such Flash Fire Chandelure, Crawdaunt, Sableye, Alomomola, and unboosted Feraligatr, as their abilities drastically improve the way Gardevoir performs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire- and Dark-types, such as Entei, Mega Absol, Chandelure, Krookodile, and Mega Houndoom, break down a fair number of Gardevoir's checks, especially Aggron and Doublade, and appreciate its ability to defeat bulky Water-types. Slow Volt Switch or U-turn support from Pokemon such as Forretress and Gligar allows Gardevoir to switch in safely, as its low defenses can often make this difficult. These two Pokemon also provide entry hazard support, which helps in breaking down foes. Natural wallbreakers, such as Nidoqueen, Choice Band Entei, Crawdaunt, and Swords Dance Lucario, are able to defeat bulkier walls that can stomach a +1 attack from Gardevoir. Steel-types and Dragon-types such as Doublade, Cobalion, Empoleon, and Hydreigon form a Dragon / Steel / Fairy core with Gardevoir, creating fantastic synergy. Physical sweepers, such as Swords Dance Lucario, Swords Dance Toxicroak, and Dragon Dance Gyarados, appreciate Gardevoir's ability to demolish most physical walls. Sticky Web support allows Gardevoir to remedy its mediocre Speed tier to outpace most of the metagame, which is especially helpful if it wants to sweep using Calm Mind.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is a fantastic STAB move and, complemented by Gardevoir's high Special Attack stat, leaves massive dents in opposing Pokemon. Psyshock is a solid secondary STAB move that has great coverage with Moonblast. It also targets Pokemon with high Special Defense stats that might be able to stomach Moonblast, especially the likes of Blissey and Florges. Focus Blast nails Steel-types, such as Mega Aggron, Cobalion, Empoleon, and Mega Steelix. Shadow Ball is a very exploitable move to be locked into, as it is quite weak against certain neutral targets; however, it does heavy damage to Pokemon such as Bronzong, Metagross, and Doublade. Trick allows Gardevoir to cripple Pokemon such as Porygon2, Blissey, Empoleon, Doublade, and Snorlax, which rely on their items to succeed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs boosts Gardevoir's Special Attack to sky-high levels, allowing it to bust through opposing Pokemon that don't resist its attacks. Full investment into its Special Attack stat gives it as much wallbreaking potential as possible. Maximum Speed investment in tandem with a Timid nature allows Gardevoir to Speed tie with base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Chandelure and Mamoswine, while outspeeding anything lower. Trace allows Gardevoir to copy the foe's ability, potentially putting itself in a favorable position. For example, it can steal Sheer Force from Nidoqueen and Feraligatr, Regenerator from Alomomola, Flash Fire from Chandelure, and Swift Swim from Mega Swampert, the last allowing it to be one of the few Pokemon to outspeed Mega Swampert while under the rain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gardevoir is best switched in on a resisted attack or on a Pokemon that is Choice locked, such as Flash Fire Chandelure locked in to Fire Blast. Choice Specs Gardevoir requires decent prediction to be able to use, as both of its STAB attacks are easily exploited by the likes of Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon. If the opponent has a remaining Pokemon that can easily take advantage of this aspect, such as Krookodile or Doublade, be wary of locking Gardevoir into a move. If you expect the opponent to switch in a bulky wall, such as Suicune, Cresselia, Blissey, or Empoleon, using Trick to cripple them for the remainder of the match helps immensely. This also allows Gardevoir to switch its moves, preventing it from being fodder to a bad matchup. If the opposing Pokemon has a useful ability, such as Sheer Force, Regenerator, or Adaptability, and Gardevoir is able to defeat the foe one-on-one, don't hesitate to send it in against it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volt Switch and U-turn users, such as Rotom-C, Forretress, and Gligar, help Gardevoir switch in safely. Fire-type Pokemon, such as Mega Houndoom, which appreciates Gardevoir's ability to OHKO Hydreigon, obliterate Steel-type Pokemon which give it trouble. Entei's natural wallbreaking capabilities help break down sturdier walls, and in return, Gardevoir defeats bulky Water-types, while Infernape's Speed tier lets it outpace the likes of Krookodile and Entei. Physical sponges, such as Gyarados, which shares good type synergy with Gardevoir, and Doublade, which sets up on a majority of Gardevoir's checks, are able to switch in to most physical attacks aimed at Gardevoir. Steel-types and Dragon-types, such as Doublade, Cobalion, Empoleon, and Mega Sceptile, are able to form a Dragon / Steel / Fairy core, which has fantastic synergy. Physical sweepers, such as Swords Dance Toxicroak, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Swords Dance Lucario, complement Gardevoir's naturally high Special Attack stat and can easily defeat most special walls. Sticky Web support prevents its middling Speed tier from being an issue against offensive teams.</p>"

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>UU isn't a very kind metagame to Flygon. While it is a very versatile Pokemon with access to great STAB attacks including Outrage and Earthquake, a good typing and ability that allow it to freely switch into Ground- and Electric-type attacks, and a good Speed tier of base 100, it is easily countered by many different Pokemon. Flygon's main drawbacks are its mediocre bulk and 4x weakness to Ice, making it very susceptible to attacks such as Ice Shard and Ice Beam. In addition, its Attack is underwhelming, and it relies heavily on Outrage to break through bulkier Pokemon. It also faces stiff competition from other Pokemon such as Hydreigon offensively and Gligar defensively. Though Flygon may seem to have many positive attributes, its drawbacks make it a very niche choice in the current UnderUsed metagame, and there will almost always be a superior choice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Claw can be used instead of Outrage for a more reliable STAB option that doesn't prevent Flygon from switching out, but the power loss is noticeable as it is 33% weaker. Iron Tail is an option to hit Fairy-types for super effective damage, but the accuracy is a bit shaky. Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage, but Outrage usually does the trick. A mixed attacking set with Draco Meteor, Earthquake, Fire Blast, and Roost or U-turn is viable to catch your opponent off-guard and to hit their physically defensive switch-ins with a powerful Draco Meteor or Fire Blast. A bulky Defog set can be used but is generally inferior to offensive Defog sets. Finally, a Choice Band set can be used for more power, but Flygon needs all the Speed it can get.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Suicune and Chesnaught can wall Flygon due to their magnificent physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types including Mega Steelix, Mega Aggron, and Bronzong can wall Flygon and set up Stealth Rock or attack it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Alomomola, Suicune, and Swampert can sponge any of Flygon's attacks and retaliate with Scald or a super effective Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-type Pokemon, such as Mamoswine, have a good chance to OHKO Flygon with their priority Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Florges and Sylveon can take a hit from Flygon and hit back with a super effective STAB attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage is Flygon's main STAB move and hits considerably hard coming off its base 100 Attack, but it should only be used late-game once all Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon have been removed. Earthquake is a secondary STAB option that hits most Poison-, Rock-, Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-type Pokemon for super effective damage, providing Flygon with great coverage. U-turn helps Flygon keep momentum during the match. Finally, Defog is used to get rid of entry hazards so that a teammate can get a clean switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature along with a Choice Scarf maximize Flygon's Speed, enabling it to outspeed key threats including Mega Sceptile, Choice Scarf Darmanitan, +1 Haxorus, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. 252 EVs are put into Attack to let Flygon hit as hard as possible. The leftover EVs are placed into Special Defense, making it easier for Flygon to take special attacks while also giving Download users such as Porygon-Z an unneeded Attack boost rather than a Special Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leading with Flygon on the get-go to either attack or U-turn out on a predicted switch can be helpful. Switch Flygon into a predicted Ground- or Electric-type move or right after a teammate has fainted so it can revenge kill the foe. As mentioned earlier, don't use Outrage while there are still Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon on the field. Instead, use it late-game when they have been removed and the rest of the opponent's team has been weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hard-hitting attackers such as Mega Beedrill, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Darmanitan, and Mienshao make it easier for Flygon to clean up late-game thanks to their powerful attacks. Pokemon with access to Volt Switch or U-turn such as Mega Beedrill, Rotom-H, Darmanitan, and Tornadus can form a VoltTurn core with Flygon. Volt Switch users deserve a special mention, as they can take on the bulky Steel- and Water-types that threaten Flygon. Be aware that most of these Pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock and appreciate Flygon's Defog support. Stealth Rock users such as Nidoqueen, Forretress, Mega Steelix, and Mega Aggron make it easier for Flygon to sweep late-game.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Noivern has fantastic base 123 Speed and base 97 Special Attack that allows it to function as a moderate wallbreaker and offense killer. Its good offensive typing allows Noivern to work well with synergistic offensive cores. It also resists the common Fire / Water / Grass cores that run amok in UnderUsed. Noivern has utility value in Taunt and Roost. Noivern might seem outclassed by other Dragon-type wallbreakers, but its Speed gives it the opportunity to run an effective Choice Specs set and destroy unprepared teams. Furthermore, because of its access to Taunt and Roost, Noivern has more surprise value than most other offensive Dragon-types in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>One can opt for a bulkier spread, focusing more on HP as opposed to Special Attack. In this instance, make sure Noivern is always left with an odd HP number (such as 351) in order to switch in on Stealth Rock as many times as possible. Focus Blast is an option against Steel-types, but it is generally inferior to Flamethrower due to its unreliable accuracy. Boomburst is a reliable powerful non-STAB move for the Choice Specs set. Expert Belt offers a little bit more power against Steel-type switch-ins, and it also provides a Choice item bluff. Draco Plate is another option that is useful for bluffing a Choice item while hitting 20% harder off the bat. Super Fang is another option for the Taunt + Roost set, allowing Noivern to surprise common switch-ins such as Florges and Blissey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Whimsicott and all Florges shut Noivern down, bar Hurricane variants for the former.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types that have the possibility of carrying Ice Beam scare Noivern. Noivern specifically struggles against Empoleon.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Noivern struggles against Mega Aggron and Doublade once it locks itself into a move.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: After the initial Draco Meteor, your opponent may seize an opportunity to have a sweeper set up on Noivern.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Noivern absolutely requires Rapid Spin or Defog support to survive, as Stealth Rock wears it down.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to Noivern's lackluster defenses, powerful attackers that are faster, such as Crobat, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Beedrill, can take it out.</p>",

Jellicent can switch into specially defensive variants and wear them down with Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, but it is 2HKOed by Grass Knot from Modest variants of Empoleon.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Offensive variants of Empoleon are stopped cold by specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Snorlax. Support Empoleon will also eventually get worn down and beaten by many special walls.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most Fighting-types hesitate to switch directly into Scald, but they can threaten to OHKO Empoleon if given a safe switch in. In particular, Guts variants of Conkeldurr may benefit from a Scald burn, while it heals off any damage with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Loss of Leftovers, residual damage from burn, and repeated switches into Spikes can wear Empoleon down to the point where it's no longer able to perform its role.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is defensive Empoleon's best STAB move, packing decent power while having a chance to cripple most of its switch-ins. Roar allows Empoleon to temporarily prevent sweeps from Pokemon such as Calm Mind Suicune and Curse Snorlax and helps it wear down the opposing team when Stealth Rock is up. Empoleon can use its wonderful typing and bulk to reliably set up Stealth Rock, and it can use Defog in its last moveslot to compress roles and clear entry hazards as well. Ice Beam can be used over either Stealth Rock or Defog, depending on the rest of Empoleon's team, to hit targets such as Taunt Hydreigon hard, as well as Grass-type switch-ins such as Celebi. Knock Off can also be used to aid in wearing down targets such as Tentacruel, Florges, and Porygon2. Protect is useful for racking up Leftovers recovery and scouting moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV distribution and nature maximize Empoleon's Special Defense to allow it to easily take hits from the likes of Kyurem and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Leftovers provides Empoleon with recovery and prevents it from being worn down too quickly, and Torrent is Empoleon's only useful ability, powering up Scald when it's at low HP. 52 EVs can be moved from Special Defense to Defense in order to nearly always survive Earthquake from Krookodile without a boosting item and Close Combat from Cobalion. A physically defensive spread of 248 HP / 172 Def / 88 SpA can be used with a Bold nature and Grass Knot to answer to Feraligatr and Mega Sharpedo; however, Special Defense investment makes more use of Empoleon's resistances.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Specially defensive Empoleon works best on balanced teams that need a check to special attackers such as Sylveon, Hydreigon, and Whimsicott. Empoleon should make use of its ability to force out these threats to set up Stealth Rock or use Defog. If Stealth Rock is up, Empoleon should use Roar on expected switches to the likes of Toxicroak and Guts Heracross, wearing down the opposing team in the process.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Empoleon should be paired with sturdy physical walls that can check the threats it tends to draw in. Gligar not only can answer threats such as Toxicroak and Heracross but also is immune to Electric- and Ground-type attacks and can free up one of Empoleon's moveslots by running Stealth Rock or Defog itself. Crobat can also check Fighting-types, including Conkeldurr, as well as Celebi, and can afford Taunt on its moveset if Empoleon runs Defog. Wish and Heal Bell support from teammates such as Sylveon lets Empoleon stay healthy, and also provides another check to special attackers that Empoleon can't handle, such as Mega Ampharos, as well as dangerous Fighting-types like Conkeldurr. Fighting-type wallbreakers can take advantage of Empoleon's ability to switch into several of their checks, such as Sylveon and Crobat.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Empoleon is an excellent user of Defog, and due to its typing and bulk, it can clear entry hazards multiple times throughout a game. Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB move coming from Empoleon's great Special Attack, denting most neutral targets. Scald can be used instead to let Empoleon wear down targets such as Tentacruel, Mandibuzz, and Cresselia. Ice Beam hits common Grass-type foes that tend to switch into Empoleon hard, as well as Crobat and Hydreigon. Grass Knot provides Empoleon with a powerful hit against opposing Water-types, notably OHKOing Swampert and preventing Feraligatr and Suicune from setting up for free. Depending on its team's needs, Empoleon can also use Flash Cannon over either of the latter two coverage moves to OHKO Whimsicott, pressure Sylveon, and check Mega Abomasnow. Signal Beam is an option to hit Celebi hard, OHKOing offensive variants, while still threatening Pokemon such as Hydreigon. Stealth Rock can be used over Defog if Empoleon's team would prefer this type of support.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack is maximized with the given EVs and a Modest nature for Empoleon to hit as hard as possible. With near-maximum HP, Empoleon isn't bothered by attackers such as Dragalge, Sylveon, and Whimsicott. The given Speed investment lets Empoleon outspeed everything up to base 65 Speed Pokemon, including Alomomola, Chesnaught, Porygon2, and uninvested Swampert. 124 EVs can be placed in Speed to outpace everything up to uninvested Seismitoad and Florges. A Shuca Berry lets Empoleon tank one powerful Ground-type hit from the likes of Nidoqueen, Mamoswine, and Krookodile in order to use Defog or retaliate with an attack. Leftovers can be used, but due to the offensive nature of the teams that Empoleon should be placed on, it probably won't contribute much to its longevity. A Chople Berry can often be used to catch Fighting-types such as Cobalion off guard. Torrent makes Hydro Pump incredibly powerful when Empoleon is weakened; with a Torrent boost, Empoleon can OHKO Heracross, Cobalion, and Doublade.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used on offensive teams that appreciate Empoleon's ability to clear entry hazards but cannot afford to give up momentum like more defensive sets do. Empoleon can switch in easily on most Fairy-, Water-, and Flying-types to do its job. Try to ensure that the opposing team's entry hazard setters are worn down or eliminated before Empoleon uses Defog, especially when it needs to clear Spikes, to help ensure entry hazards stay off its side of the field. Keep Empoleon healthy when it's needed to check opposing Ground-types or Pokemon with Ground-type coverage, such as Mega Aerodactyl; for example, even with a Shuca Berry, Empoleon takes around 80% from Adamant Life Orb Mamoswine's Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Empoleon should be placed on offensive teams that rely on Defog support with powerful teammates that can capitalize on its ability to check the appropriate threats. For example, Mega Beedrill needs Stealth Rock cleared from its side and can U-turn to Empoleon against opposing Mega Aggron and Crobat. Because Empoleon tends to draw in Heracross and Heliolisk, it needs teammates that can check these Pokemon. Whimsicott can do this well in addition to deterring the bulky setup sweepers that can potentially set up on Empoleon.</p> <p>Reliable entry hazard setters that can last long enough to set up Stealth Rock mid-game, but that also contribute towards the offensive nature of the team, should be paired with Empoleon if it uses Defog. Examples are Krookodile and Mega Swampert. Gligar can also check threatening Electric-, Fighting-, and Ground-types and appreciate Empoleon's ability to check attackers such as Kyurem, Feraligatr, and Mega Abomasnow; it can also provide Stealth Rock and U-turn support to complement Empoleon's Defog.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Agility, Empoleon becomes a potent late-game sweeper capable of outspeeding several of its usual checks, such as Krookodile and Infernape. Hydro Pump is Empoleon's most powerful viable move, though Surf or Scald can be used if their accuracy is preferred. Ice Beam grants Empoleon super effective coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types. Grass Knot hits Water-types, with the exception of Tentacruel and opposing Empoleon, hard, but if Water-types are eliminated beforehand, Empoleon can use Substitute to get down to Torrent and Petaya Berry range reliably.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature maximize Empoleon's power while allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and Choice Scarf Rotom formes after an Agility. The remaining EVs slightly increase Empoleon's bulk while allowing it to get into Petaya Berry range after using Substitute only three times. Torrent is Empoleon's only useful ability, powering up Hydro Pump at low HP. A Petaya Berry lets Empoleon throw out absurdly strong +1 Torrent-boosted Hydro Pumps at low HP. A Shuca Berry, however, can be used to set up on Ground-types such as Krookodile and Nidoking comfortably. Chople Berry is also a possibility, but many Fighting-type attacks from wallbreakers like Heracross and Lucario can OHKO Empoleon anyway. Life Orb is also an option, but the recoil damage takes away from Empoleon's ability to maintain its sweep, and a Petaya Berry grants a greater boost anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Agility Empoleon works well as a cleaner on offensive teams, especially on Spikes-stacking hyper offense, as most of Empoleon's checks, including Blissey and Umbreon, are grounded. Priority attacks such as Mega Absol's Sucker Punch and even Entei's Extreme Speed can pick off Empoleon because it's reliant on the activation of Torrent and Petaya Berry to power up its moves. Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave from Conkeldurr and Lucario can also stop a sweep. Even if it can't set up in a match, Empoleon can function as a check to Flying- and Fairy-types as well as Dragon-types if it chooses to run a Shuca Berry. Empoleon's typing and natural bulk allow it to set up on Choice-locked attacks such as Kyurem's Ice Beam, and Empoleon's team can even try to lure these attacks to create setup opportunities. After an Agility, Empoleon is still outsped by Choice Scarf users faster than Rotom-A.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Froslass is hyper offense's best Spikes setter and can support Empoleon by wearing down its checks. Chesnaught and Roserade can also set up Spikes and have exceptional synergy with Empoleon. Empoleon appreciates the removal of opposing Water-types when running Substitute instead of Grass Knot. It also struggles with dedicated special walls such as Snorlax, so Pursuit trappers, special wallbreakers, and strong physical attackers make for good teammates. For example, Nasty Plot Infernape and Choice Band Heracross can take down both Water-types and special walls, and Krookodile can deal moderate damage to special walls switching out with Pursuit and can set up Stealth Rock to support Empoleon. Whimsicott can respond to several of Empoleon's checks, including Suicune, Umbreon, and Mega Absol, and can grant Empoleon safe opportunities to switch in and set up with U-turn, Encore, and Memento.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>As one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the entire game, Cresselia stands out as a great defensive and support Pokemon in the tier. Her unparalleled bulk allows her to check a huge variety of threats, including Mega Aerodactyl, Nidoqueen, most Fighting-types, and many more. Her ability, Levitate, gives her a useful immunity to Ground attacks, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, making her even harder to weaken. Cresselia has a great support movepool with access to Thunder Wave, dual screens, Trick Room, and Lunar Dance along with semi-reliable recovery in Moonlight. Despite her fantastic defensive prowess, Cresselia has a mediocre offensive presence and is rather reliant on Calm Mind boosts to deal significant damage. Her subpar mono-Psychic typing grants her two resistances to Fighting- and Psychic-type attacks but leaves her weak to Dark-, Bug-, and Ghost-type attacks. Finally, Cresselia is very vulnerable to all forms of status and can be easily worn down with burn and poison.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mental Herb can guarantee Trick Room being set to allow Pokemon such as Mega Abomasnow to open holes early in the game and then have another chance to sweep later on thanks to Lunar Dance. Cresselia has access to Trick, which can be used in conjunction with a Choice item to cripple a target. Finally, Cresselia's bulk allows her to be a reliable manual weather setter that can also support weather-based sweepers, such as Kingdra, with Lunar Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Aggron and Empoleon can easily take boosted attacks from Cresselia and phaze her. Doublade can take anything Cresselia has to offer and set up on her.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Mega Sharpedo, Krookodile, and Hydreigon can threaten Cresselia out with their powerful STAB moves, though they must be wary of switching into Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Heracross and Mega Beedrill can both do enormous damage to Cresselia with Megahorn and U-turn, respectively, although neither can safely switch into a Psychic-type move or Thunder Wave. Escavalier does not fear anything from Cresselia and can threaten her with Megahorn or get valuable chip damage with Pursuit. Yanmega can threaten Cresselia and hit her through a potential Substitute with Bug Buzz.</p> <p><strong>CurseLax</strong>: Snorlax can set up on Cresselia and can beat Calm Mind variants, taking little damage from Psyshock thanks to Curse and outdamaging Moonblast and Ice Beam with Body Slam or Return.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Cresselia's defensive and sweeping capabilities are forfeited if she is badly poisoned. Burn and poison can wear down Cresselia, force her to use Moonlight frequently, and severely hinder her ability to take hits.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: With only a few weak attacks, Cresselia can't do much under Taunt and can be worn down or beaten 1v1 by Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Cresselia's Special Attack and Special Defense, increasing her offensive presence while making her insanely hard to KO with neutral special attacks. Psyshock is Cresselia's main STAB move and allows her to beat other Calm Mind users such as Suicune and Florges by hitting their unboosted Defense. Moonblast provides useful coverage alongside Psyshock and gives Cresselia a super effective move against Dark- and Dragon-types so that they cannot switch in or set up for free. Ice Beam may be used over Moonblast to hit specific targets, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Rotom-C, harder. Moonlight allows Cresselia to restore her HP and set up more comfortably against special attackers such as Nidoqueen and Mega Blastoise. Moonlight also lets Cresselia reliably check physical attackers such as Haxorus and Mienshao by keeping herself healthy. Substitute can be used instead to prevent status and allow Cresselia to set up more easily in certain scenarios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Cresselia can boost her Special Defense with Calm Mind, so maximum investment is placed into HP and Defense with a Bold nature, allowing her to easily tank most non-super effective physical hits. 16 EVs are placed into Speed to outspeed uninvested base 85s, such as Suicune and Gligar, as well as uninvested Rotom formes. Leftovers gives Cresselia passive recovery, making up for the HP lost from creating Substitutes and lessening her need to use Moonlight.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind Cresselia works best on balanced and stall teams as a physical wall and a win condition that can defeat opposing CroCune. Cresselia should not try to set up while powerful wallbreakers with super effective STAB moves, such as Hydreigon and Heracross, are still on the opposing side of the field. She should scout for Toxic from Pokemon such as Empoleon to avoid being crippled and put on a timer. Cresselia can set up on a wide range of both physical and special attackers, such as Mienshao and Nidoqueen, as well as various support Pokemon, such as Vaporeon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cresselia should be paired with teammates that can take strong Dark- and Bug-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Absol and Heracross. Status absorbers and clerics are useful if Cresselia opts for Moonlight over Substitute. Florges can fulfill both of these roles and is a useful partner for Cresselia. Cresselia needs teammates to weaken or eliminate bulky Steel-types, such as Mega Aggron and Empoleon, that she struggles to KO before being phazed or worn down. Entei can check these Pokemon and spread burns, giving Cresselia an easier time setting up, and also appreciates Cresselia's ability to beat Suicune. Heracross and Machamp with Guts are also good offensive partners, as they threaten most of Cresselia's checks and also absorb status directed at Cresselia.</p>"

Light Clay is the preferred item to maximize Light Screen and Reflect turns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dual screens Cresselia works best on hyper offense teams with setup sweepers that can take advantage of the support Cresselia provides. Cresselia should set up screens early game and switch out as soon as possible to allow a teammate to set up or attack. She should set up the appropriate screen to reduce damage taken from the foe on the field at the time. Later in the game, Cresselia can set up screens again if possible and use Lunar Dance to heal up a teammate, giving it a second chance at a sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cresselia should be used with setup sweepers such as Slurpuff and Lucario. She also needs teammates that threaten common Defog users, which can remove her screens. Mega Aerodactyl can KO or Taunt Defog users and enjoys the support of dual screens and Lunar Dance.

    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is rather one-dimensional in the UnderUsed metagame, as it is outclassed by Roserade, Chesnaught, and Celebi it most of its potential roles; however, it is an extremely potent sun sweeper thanks to Chlorophyll, which doubles its Speed while the sun is up. While Chlorophyll is activated, Venusaur can outspeed Mega Aerodactyl and slower Choice Scarf users while having a Modest nature, which lets it hit much harder with Life Orb and Growth. Venusaur also has a pretty good offensive typing and an even better defensive typing in Grass / Poison, which allows it to set up on Pokemon such as Sylveon and Whimsicott while resisting most forms of priority, such as Crawdaunt's and Feraligatr's Aqua Jet and Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave from Fighting-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Venusaur can run Sunny Day, which allows it to be used on non-sun teams, but it loses out on either coverage, Growth, or recovery, which isn't a very good trade-off. Sleep Powder can be run over Growth to cripple most of Venusaur's switch-ins. Venusaur can run a mixed set that has Growth, Earthquake, Power Whip, and Sludge Bomb to beat most of its checks. A physical Swords Dance set is also viable, but it is mostly outclassed by other Attack- and Speed-boosting Pokemon because it needs a lot of support to be effective. Solar Beam can be run, but only in tandem with Sleep Powder, and only if you have another Chlorophyll sweeper on your team already. Defensive sets with Knock Off or Leech Seed can be used, but are generally outclassed by Chesnaught and Tangela due their higher physical bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Mandibuzz, Snorlax, and Blissey can survive Venusaur's attacks and cripple it in return with Thunder Wave, threaten it with Body Slam, or use Knock Off so it deals less damage later.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Dragalge, Tentacruel, and Crobat resist most of Venusaur's attacks and hit back hard; however, the latter two cannot switch into Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fire, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Most Psychic-types, such as Cresselia and Gardevoir, can take Venusaur's attacks and deal a lot of damage in return with their STAB moves. Gardevoir can also copy Chlorophyll with Trace and outspeed Venusaur if it's running a Timid nature or Speed tie if it's running a Modest one.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Most Fire-types such as Entei and Mega Houndoom can OHKO Venusaur with their STAB moves and can take advantage of their Fire-type moves while the sun is up. Choice Scarf Infernape is especially threatening, as it is one of the very few Pokemon that can outspeed Venusaur while Chlorophyll is activated.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Abomasnow, and Fletchinder can all hit Venusaur with their super effective priority moves. Abomasnow is especially threatening, as it can also change the weather and end Venusaur's sweep.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with Prankster, such as Whimsicott and Tornadus, can clear or change the weather to end Venusaur's sweep.</p>",

Sludge Bomb is Venusaur's main STAB option, as it can hit a lot of Pokemon such as Sylveon and Florges extremely hard, although it can't hit Chesnaught. Giga Drain lets Venusaur hit most Pokemon that resist Poison very hard while recovering health against a lot of frailer Pokemon. Although Hidden Power Fire is kind of weak, it gets a power boost under the sun and can hit Steel-types, as well as other Pokemon that resist Venusaur's STAB combination, such as Toxicroak.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Chlorophyll doubles Venusaur's Speed while the sun is up, allowing it to outspeed most relevant Choice Scarf users, as well as Mega Aerodactyl. Life Orb boosts its damage output by a significant amount, and while Lum Berry can be used to switch into Thunder Wave and Scald more easily, there is a significant decrease in sweeping potential. It has maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed EVs allow Venusaur to outspeed most relevant Choice Scarf users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Venusaur performs best as a late-game sweeper, destroying teams when its checks and counters have been removed; however, it still performs well as a mid-game cleaner that can punch holes in a team for a sweeper to come in later. Venusaur performs best on sun teams, which can set up the sun for it to sweep in games. It is best for Venusaur to begin setting up Growth against Pokemon such as Florges and Chesnaught, which can't really do much to it in return.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Venusaur likes sun setters, especially Whimsicott, which can set up the sun with Prankster and use Memento to help bring Venusaur in so it can easily set up. Cresselia and Uxie are also good sun setters because they can help bring Venusaur in thanks to Lunar Dance and Memento, respectively, while Sableye can be a good sun setter thanks to Prankster. Fire-type sun setters such as Entei can also work as good partners, as they work not only as sun setters but also as sun abusers thanks to their powerful Fire-type attacks. Mega Aerodactyl is a good partner for Venusaur due to its typing, which allows it to beat the Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-types that beat Venusaur while also being able to pick off Pokemon that Venusaur has weakened. Mega Houndoom hits very hard when the sun is up and also hits the Steel-types that non-Hidden Power Fire Venusaur can't, making it a good partner.

Incredible defensive stats turn Mega Blastoise into the perfect bulky wallbreaker, and an excellent Special Attack makes it viable as an offensive spinner, capable of working on any kind of team. Even when opting for an alternative defensive Rapid Spin set, Mega Blastoise still hits hard with no investment. Unfortunately, lack of reliable recovery makes it status bait and hinders its longevity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Blastoise can use a defensive Rapid Spin set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature and the EVs can be altered to give Mega Blastoise some special bulk.

For the offensive Rapid Spin set, Mega Blastoise can opt to use Roar or Toxic instead of Ice Beam or Dragon Pulse for increased defensive pressure against Wish users such as Florges, Vaporeon, and Blissey. Water Spout is an interesting attacking option, especially when Sticky Web is set up. More importantly, however, Water Spout only hits as weakly as Scald after Mega Blastoise goes lower than 55% health. Refresh is an option for regular Blastoise to heal itself of status ailments and prevent it from getting worn down by poison and burns. Finally, Whirlpool can be used to trap and weaken the opponent's Pokemon, increasing residual damage and adding to Mega Blastoise's utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Heliolisk and Mega Ampharos are two major threats to Mega Blastoise, despite Mega Ampharos's weaknesses to Dragon Pulse and Ice Beam and Heliolisk's weakness to Aura Sphere. Furthermore, many Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Porygon2 will occasionally carry Thunderbolt in order to prepare for Mega Blastoise.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Shaymin and Roserade are two main threats that force Mega Blastoise to switch out, as Mega Blastoise does not like being hit by powerful STAB Grass-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Florges, Blissey, Umbreon, Sylveon, and Vaporeon all prevent Mega Blastoise from wallbreaking effectively; Wish and Protect work around Mega Blastoise very well.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Machamp and Krookodile can deal major damage to Mega Blastoise on the switch or during one-on-one situations.

Scald applies defensive pressure to the opponent's team with its 30% chance to burn, further hindering the opponent's opportunities to set up entry hazards.

Dark Pulse provides Mega Blastoise with some decent Mega Launcher-boosted coverage and makes for near-perfect neutral coverage in conjunction with Blastoise's STAB move.

An alternative spread to hit a Speed benchmark of 242 can be used to outspeed Honchkrow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Blastoise has two main roles. The first is to use Rapid Spin and keep hazards off the field and the second is to wallbreak. Though Mega Blastoise can be used somewhat effectively as an anti-lead, it is always wise to keep it around for the long haul due to its precious access to Rapid Spin. It is a great option for both offensive and defensive teams due to its dual Rapid Spinning and wallbreaking capabilities. Lastly, it is important to note that Mega Blastoise is not very effective against the top special walls, such as Blissey, Florges, and Umbreon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Blastoise can work on both offensive and defensive teams, but it is best used with cleric support from Pokemon such as Roserade, Sylveon, and Florges. Mega Blastoise also appreciates Wish support from Florges, Blissey, Sylveon, or Umbreon, as all of them can sponge Electric- and Grass-type special attacks. As with most wallbreakers, Mega Blastoise appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support that can help retain momentum for optimal wallbreaking. Pokemon such as Gligar and Heliolisk make good teammates in this respect; Gligar can use U-turn, set up Stealth Rock, and offer an Electric-type immunity, while Heliolisk provides a fast and powerful Volt Switch and also resists Electric-type attacks. Lastly, this set appreciates entry hazard support for increased wallbreaking potential. Pokemon such as Roserade make good teammates for this reason.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald applies defensive pressure to the opponent's team with its 30% chance to burn. Hydro Pump's power is good for wallbreaking beyond that of STAB Scald, but it is slightly unreliable due to only 80% accuracy. Dark Pulse is a fantastic coverage move, offering Mega Blastoise near-perfect neutral coverage alongside Scald or Hydro Pump. Ice Beam is a great option for dealing with the many Dragon- and Flying-types in UU, and Aura Sphere is a decent coverage option for Dark- and Steel- types. Dragon Pulse can be useful if you find that Aura Sphere or Ice Beam provides redundant coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximize Mega Blastoise's Special Attack investment in order to take on a wide variety of frail attackers and walls. Mega Launcher grants Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse, Dragon Pulse, and Aura Sphere a 1.5x boost. Lack of passive recovery means status, especially Toxic, is a problem. 200 Speed EVs allow Mega Blastoise to outspeed and uninvested base 100s. Furthermore, with Sticky Web support, Mega Blastoise outspeeds anything that is base 115 Speed or under. Mega Blastoise's Speed EVs can be tweaked to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Gligar and Adamant maximum Speed Choice Band Machamp. In this case, moving 72 EVs from HP to Speed to hit 210 Speed is ideal. Mega Blastoise can also run maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed everything up to and including neutral-natured base 90s. Keep in mind that this set should only be used when your team already has Rapid Spin or Defog Support.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Mega Blastoise's teammates are able to control entry hazards without relying on Mega Blastoise's access to Rapid Spin, it is able to gain a moveslot for an extra coverage move, turning it into dedicated special wallbreaker. Mega Blastoise's task is to wallbreak, stallbreak, and rip apart frail attackers attempting to work around Mega Blastoise's bulk. Mega Blastoise is excellent against bulky Ground-type leads such as Mamoswine and Donphan, but it is not very effective against the top specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Florges, and Umbreon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Use Mega Blastoise alongside Pokemon with Heal Bell / Aromatherapy support such as Roserade and Florges. Mega Blastoise also appreciates Wish support from Florges, Blissey, or Umbreon, as all three can sponge Electric- and Grass-type special attacks. As with most wallbreakers, Mega Blastoise appreciates teammates with U-turn and Volt Switch. Pokemon such as Gligar and Heliolisk make good teammates in this respect; Gligar can use U-turn, set up Stealth Rock, and offer an Electric-type immunity, while Heliolisk provides a fast and powerful Volt Switch and also resists Electric-type attacks. Galvantula is a decent option for Sticky Web support, giving this set more opportunities to wallbreak against faster bulkier threats. Tailwind support is another way that this set can shine. Hitting 255 speed allows Mega Blastoise to outspeed Choice Scarf Mienshao under Tailwind. Lastly, this set appreciates entry hazard support for increased wallbreaking potential. Physical wallbreakers also help Mega Blastoise get past specially defensive walls. Ultimately, Mega Blastoise works best on bulky offensive or balanced teams.</p>"

      "Defensive Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a consistent STAB attack that also has a burn chance. Rapid Spin allows Blastoise to remove entry hazards that wear down its teammates. Roar phazes the opposing Pokemon, ensuring Blastoise isn't setup bait. Toxic is used to weaken opposing walls, especially Jellicent, which is immune to Scald and Rapid Spin, as well as Pokemon that either resist or are immune to Scald, such as Mega Sceptile and Heliolisk, respectively. Ice Beam can be used to hit Dragon- and Grass-types for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Blastoise passive recovery. Torrent is the ability of choice, as it is more consistent than Rain Dish. A Bold nature is used with the given EV spread to maximize Blastoise's physical bulk. This Blastoise set faces competition as a defensive Rapid Spin user from Tentacruel, which has a good secondary typing, a good Speed tier, and Toxic Spikes, but Blastoise is also viable, as it is able to take on the numerous physically offensive Fire-types in the tier thanks to its better physical bulk. Regular Blastoise is normally overshadowed by its Mega counterpart when it comes to spinning, but it is better defensively, as it is able to hold Leftovers, which gives it a form of recovery without using a moveslot as well as more staying power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Should the opposing player set entry hazards that are detrimental to the rest of your team, be sure to remove them with Rapid Spin. Blastoise should be sent in to wall physical attackers, especially Fire-types, such as Entei and Arcanine. Due to Blastoise's good natural bulk coupled with the EV investment, it can stop dangerous sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr, from sweeping by phazing them via Roar, crippling them via either Scald burns or Toxic, or, in Salamence's case, OHKOing with Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Pokemon with access to Wish and a clerical move, such as Blissey and Florges, make for good teammates, as they can heal Blastoise by Wish passing and removing status effects that Blastoise could receive throughout a match. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of entry hazards, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Entei, also make for good teammates. Dragon-types, such as Hydreigon and Dragalge, make for good teammates, as they resist Grass- and Electric-type moves, which hit Blastoise for super effective damage. In return, Blastoise resists the Ice-type moves that hit these Dragon-types for super effective damage. Grounded Poison-types, such as Dragalge and Nidoqueen, also make for good teammates, as they are able to remove Toxic Spikes, which poison Blastoise upon switching in, while Blastoise can remove other entry hazards.</p>"

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Beedrill shines in the UU metagame thanks to its Mega Evolution, which, by way of amazing Attack and Speed stats and Adaptability, grants it the strongest U-turn in the tier, letting it pummel offensive and defensive teams alike. It can grab offensive momentum with very little trouble thanks to the aforementioned qualities, which makes it one of the best offensive Pokemon in the tier. However, Beedrill has a somewhat shallow movepool aside from its STAB attacks, and it only has access to Knock Off and Drill Run as offensive coverage moves. It also has pitiful defensive stats, as well as a mediocre defensive typing. It also is forced to run Protect so that it can Mega Evolve and get the Speed boost without taking damage, as its Speed before Mega Evolving is decent at best. Despite these flaws, Beedrill is still a fantastic Pokemon, and it should always be considered when making an offensive team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>X-Scissor can be used over U-turn if you feel that keeping up offensive momentum is not necessary, as it hits for more damage. Swords Dance can be used to boost Beedrill's attack immensely, but Beedrill usually does not have the room to run this and finds it difficult to set up. If it does manage to set up, it can still get revenge killed easily by priority and Choice Scarf users, so running Swords Dance is not usually worth the loss of coverage. Toxic Spikes can be used to wear down some of Beedrill's switch-ins, such as Alomomola and Porygon2, making it easier for Beedrill to deal with them later in the game. Pursuit is an option to cause significant damage to fleeing Ghost-types and Psychic-types, such as Reuniclus and Chandelure.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: As Beedrill uses U-turn often, it generally does not stay in for long periods of time. Passive damage from Stealth Rock wears down Beedrill quickly and pressures it to stay off the field.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Faster Pokemon</strong>: Because Beedrill has a very high Speed stat, Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Darmanitan can take it on. It should be noted, however, that Beedrill outspeeds Choice Scarf users that aren't above base 80 Speed. Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Mega Beedrill and OHKOes it with its STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Beedrill's pitiful defenses make it extremely susceptible to priority, such as Lucario and Entei's Extreme Speed and Fletchinder's Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Due to their huge physical bulk and defensive typing, Mega Aggron, Doublade, and Forretress scoff at all of Beedrill's attacks and can OHKO it with their Steel-type STAB attacks. However, Doublade doesn't like having its Eviolite Knocked Off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon that Resist Beedrill's STAB Attacks</strong>: Pokemon that can tank Beedrill's STAB attacks and recover the damage, such as Gligar and Crobat, make for good answers to Beedrill and are a pain for Beedrill to face. Tentacruel also resists both STAB moves and has decent Defense, but it is vulnerable to Drill Run and gets worn down fairly easily.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon with high physical bulk like Alomomola and Suicune can tank Beedrill's STAB attacks and heal off the damage taken with Wish and Rest, respectively, while forcing Beedrill out due to the chance of a Scald burn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Don't Stand So Close to Me": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is Beedrill's main STAB move, as it nets Beedrill offensive momentum with little trouble and is useful to get some chip damage. Protect is used so that Beedrill can get the Speed boost from Mega Evolving without taking any damage and is also useful to scout for foes' movesets and potential Choice items. Poison Jab is Beedrill's strongest attack, as well as its main Poison-type STAB attack, and it has a fairly high chance to poison the target, which works well in conjunction with Protect to rack up damage on the foe while scouting for its moveset. Knock Off hits Ghost-types such as Chandelure for super effective damage and also cripples Pokemon reliant on their item. Drill Run is mainly used for coverage, as it hits Poison- and Steel-types that resist Beedrill's STAB attacks, such as Tentacruel, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Lucario, for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A standard EV spread is used to max out Beedrill's offensive prowess, with the remaining EVs in Defense so it can maintain an odd HP number. A Jolly nature is used so Beedrill can Speed tie with other base 145 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Sceptile and opposing Beedrill. An Adamant nature can be used instead to give Beedrill a little extra power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Protect should be used the first turn Beedrill is sent out if the opposing Pokemon is faster, as it lets Beedrill safely Mega Evolve and attain the Speed boost without taking damage, scouting the foe's moveset in the process. Although it has poor defensive stats, Beedrill's decent defensive typing gives it 4x resistances it can use to switch in. However, some powerful physical moves such as Mienshao's Reckless High Jump Kick have a shot at 2HKOing it, although Beedrill can use Protect to scout and potentially make Mienshao take crash damage. Beedrill can grab momentum with little trouble thanks to its strong U-turn and high Speed stat, so pairing it with entry hazard users is a good idea. Keeping entry hazards off your side of the field is appreciated, as Beedrill will be switching out more than often due to U-turn and can be KOed by priority users after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is appreciated, as Beedrill can force out a good portion of the tier and grab offensive momentum easily with U-turn. As such, entry hazard setters such as Swampert, Roserade, Froslass, and Chesnaught are good partners for Beedrill. Spikes in particular also works well with Beedrill, as it weakens most of Beedrill's grounded checks. Entry hazard removers also work well with Beedrill, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and will be switching in and out very often, so Empoleon, Donphan, and Gligar, the latter forming a nice momentum core with Beedrill, are good partners for it. Other U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Crobat, work like a charm when paired up with Beedrill, as they can pivot out to Beedrill with little trouble and keep up offensive momentum.</p>"

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>With the power provided by combination of Sheer Force and Life Orb as well as fantastic coverage, Nidoqueen can act as an outstanding wallbreaker. In addition, Nidoqueen has good bulk with a typing that grants it a great set of resistances and an immunity to Electric and two common status moves, Toxic and Thunder Wave. To complement its offensive attributes, Nidoqueen has access to useful utility moves, such as Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and Roar. However, Nidoqueen's poor Speed and lack of reliable recovery leave it prone to being easily worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoqueen has access to Focus Blast, which, after being boosted by Sheer Force and Life Orb, can deal severe damage to many of its switch-ins, such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2. Nidoqueen can also use Taunt, which prevents defensive Pokemon from recovering and slower Defog users from clearing its entry hazards. Dragon Tail is an alternate form of phazing, but is very weak and relatively inaccurate; it also cannot phaze Protect users with Dragon Tail, so Roar is usually the better option. A physical or mixed set is possible, but Nidoking is usually better for this role due to its higher base Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dedicated Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Snorlax, Porygon2, Umbreon, specially defensive Cresselia, and specially defensive Vaporeon all give Nidoqueen trouble, as they avoid taking significant damage from any of its moves.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Calm Mind Cresselia and CroCune can use offensive variants of Nidoqueen as setup fodder, although they must be careful not to get phazed.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong</strong>: Unless it runs Fire Blast, Nidoqueen cannot touch Bronzong and will get worn down by Gyro Ball or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground- and Water-types</strong>: Strong Ground- and Water-types such as Krookodile and offensive Suicune can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earth Power is Nidoqueen's primary STAB move and is able to OHKO or 2HKO a large portion of the tier. Ice Beam has great coverage in tandem with Earth Power and leaves only a select few Pokemon that resist both moves. These two moves are particularly great for pressuring common Defog and Rapid Spin users, such as Crobat, Gligar, Empoleon, Forretress, and Donphan. Stealth Rock pressures opposing teams by punishing switches. Sludge Wave is Nidoqueen's second STAB attack that works particularly well for damaging Fairy-types such as Florges as well as Rotom-H, which resists Ice Beam and is immune to Earth Power. Toxic Spikes can be used instead to aid in wearing down bulky Pokemon such as Vaporeon. Nidoqueen also has access to many other moves that can be used to hit specific foes. Examples of such moves are Thunderbolt to hit bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Alomomola, and Mega Blastoise and Flamethrower to hit Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs are used in Special Attack with a Modest nature to enable Nidoqueen to hit as hard as possible. Sheer Force negates Life Orb recoil, giving a 1.69x boost to Nidoqueen's moves at the cost of their secondary effect. The given Speed investment allows Nidoqueen to outspeed uninvested Suicune and Gligar, while retaining sufficient bulk to easily tank resisted hits from the likes of Mienshao and Lucario. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP to add to Nidoqueen's already-impressive bulk. EVs may be moved from HP to Speed in order for Nidoqueen to outspeed more threats; for example, an EV spread of 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe can be used to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and Pokemon with uninvested base 100 and lower Speed, such as Tentacruel and Defensive Arcanine.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Nidoqueen can easily use its great offensive presence and many resistances to find opportunities to set up entry hazards. When attacking, prediction is key, as many opponents will try to pivot their Pokemon around Nidoqueen's moves. When the opponent does have a Pokemon that can safely take any of Nidoqueen's hits, such as Umbreon or Bronzong, Nidoqueen should take advantage of the obvious switch to set up entry hazards or double switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nidoqueen appreciates the support of wallbreakers that can remove the special walls that it cannot defeat. Machamp is a particularly great partner that can easily remove Pokemon such as Umbreon, Blissey, and Snorlax. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is another good partner that has good offensive synergy with Nidoqueen, checking certain offensive threats such as Krookodile and Shaymin while a mixed Life Orb set helps to break past special walls. Both of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Nidoqueen's ability to remove Fairy-types. On balanced teams, Nidoqueen appreciates Wish support, as it is prone to getting worn down by Pokemon such as Mienshao and Crobat.</p>"

      "Defensive Entry Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock wears enemies down by cutting into their health upon switching, but if one of Nidoqueen's teammates already carries Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes can be used instead. Roar allows Nidoqueen to phaze foes and rack up residual damage from the entry hazards it has set. Ice Beam and Earth Power have good coverage together, pressuring many of the tier's hazard removers and hitting hard even without Special Attack investment. Flamethrower can be used over either attack to KO Forretress, which can otherwise spin away Nidoqueen's entry hazards rather easily. Earthquake can be used over Earth Power with a Relaxed nature to OHKO Mega Beedrill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs significantly boost Nidoqueen's physical defense and allow it to take most physical hits with ease. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to allow Nidoqueen to hit opposing offensive Pokemon marginally harder. Black Sludge restores Nidoqueen's health passively and is its only form of recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best on balanced and stall teams as a check to Fighting-, Fairy-, and Electric-types. Nidoqueen can use its impressive bulk to set up entry hazards against physical attackers such as Mienshao, Crobat, and Mega Beedrill. After Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes have been set up, Nidoqueen should use Roar to rack up residual damage on switch-ins and possibly give itself a favorable matchup.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates such as Mega Ampharos and Kyurem that put pressure on Defog users work well with Nidoqueen. In addition, spinblockers help ensure that Nidoqueen's entry hazards remain on the field. Nidoqueen is prone to getting worn down, so it greatly appreciates Wish support. Blissey can full heal Nidoqueen with her Wishes and help with some of the powerful special attackers that trouble Nidoqueen. Other phazing Pokemon can make full use of the entry hazards Nidoqueen sets. Whirlwind Snorlax is an example that has great defensive synergy with Nidoqueen.</p>"

Unfortunately, Nidoking hits a poor Speed tier, making it easily revenge killed. Nidoking also faces stiff competition from its bulkier counterpart, Nidoqueen, which hits harder with a Modest nature; however, Nidoking is not to be underestimated, as it is not frail enough to be taken down by any resisted move, and it can dish out serious damage in return.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, Focus Blast, Fire Blast, Shadow Ball, Megahorn, and Sucker Punch are all acceptable options for Nidoking, depending on the needs of your team. A Choice Scarf set can be used with a Timid nature and a fourth attacking move, preferably Thunderbolt. Toxic Spikes can also be used in order to apply more defensive pressure, although Nidoqueen uses the move better. Finally, Taunt can be used to prevent walls from using recovery moves or inflicting status ailments on Nidoking, but Nidoking has to give up a coverage move in order to use it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dedicated Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Mandibuzz and Cresselia can switch into Nidoking's moves, though others such as Blissey and Umbreon must be wary of switching into Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Entei, Celebi, Haxorus, Hydreigon, and +1 setup sweepers such as Gyarados can outspeed and OHKO Nidoking.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Wave is Nidoking's go-to STAB move, 2HKOing Florges and providing the most base damage out of all of Nidoking's moves. Earth Power is Nidoking's secondary STAB move and is useful against Steel-types and Pokemon that resist Poison. Ice Beam is for Flying-types, such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, that either resist or are immune to Nidoking's other moves. Superpower hits Umbreon and Blissey for super effective damage, which is useful as a late-game surprise tactic, while Stealth Rock allows Nidoking to surprise the opponent by opting to apply passive pressure instead of offensive pressure. Stealth Rock also helps Nidoking in cleaning up late-game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs are used to help Nidoking wallbreak as easily as possible. 252 Speed EVs allow Nidoking to Speed tie with many prominent offensive Pokemon, such as Heracross, and outspeed slower Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. A Modest nature can be used to hit harder than Nidoqueen, gaining more guaranteed 2HKOs on bulky Water-type switch-ins such as Suicune. Life Orb works perfectly with Sheer Force and Nidoking's moveset, negating any recoil for a 69% power boost to Nidoking's special moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Nidoking is best used as a special wallbreaker or lure for special walls, as Blissey loves to tackle Nidoking head-on. Prediction will often be the biggest problem when facing balance cores that can work around Nidoking's attacks. As a result, it is often best to rely on teammates to play around the opponent's team; Nidoking should be wallbreaking, not psyching out the opponent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Rotom-H, Forretress, and Gligar can absorb physical hits and get Nidoking in safely against many physical wallbreakers. Entry hazard users work well with Nidoking's special wallbreaking potential. Nidoking is prone to being revenge killed, so bulky team support is a must. Some setup sweepers such as Cresselia appreciate Nidoking's ability to take care of phazers such as Empoleon and attackers or Taunters such as Crobat.

    "overview": "<p>Although it is completely outclassed by Florges and Aromatisse in a purely defensive role, Clefairy can function as a pivot on some bulky offense teams, offering utility that other Pokemon cannot provide. In particular, its access to Thunder Wave and Healing Wish make it stand out from other Fairy-types as a supporter for offensive teams. Due to its immunity to passive damage by virtue of Magic Guard and reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, Clefairy can stay healthy enough to check what it needs to throughout a game. With Special Defense investment, Clefairy performs well as a check to certain special attackers, such as Kyurem and Mega Blastoise, that can give most bulky offense teams trouble. Access to additional utility moves in Stealth Rock and Encore and a generally open fourth moveslot mean that it can customize its moveset to perform exactly the role its team needs it to. However, even with Eviolite, Clefairy suffers from rather poor bulk and is 2HKOed by many physical attackers. In addition, it's complete setup fodder for many bulky setup sweepers, such as Reuniclus and Snorlax, if it lacks Encore. Clefairy is taken advantage of by many offensive Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Mega Swampert as well. Thus, Clefairy is often not worth using in favor of other Fairy-types, though its niche makes it a good choice on certain teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Calm Mind can be a decent move in the fourth slot to ensure that Clefairy can win last Pokemon scenarios against Pokemon like Umbreon and non-Calm Mind Florges; however, Clefairy is generally outclassed as a Calm Mind user by Florges and would prefer to run utility moves in its fourth moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Loss of Eviolite</strong>: Knock Off and Trick severely cripple Clefairy, rendering it unable to check the special attackers it should be able to.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Cobalion, Mega Aggron, and Doublade can easily KO Clefairy, and only Cobalion fears Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types take negligible damage from Moonblast. Crobat can take complete advantage of Clefairy with Taunt, Dragalge can easily KO it with Sludge Wave or set up Toxic Spikes, and Nidoqueen is immune to Thunder Wave and puts pressure on Clefairy and its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: While Clefairy can cripple sweepers such as Feraligatr and Slurpuff with Thunder Wave, sweepers that don't mind the paralysis such as Calm Mind Suicune and Calm Mind Florges can take advantage of Clefairy.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Clefairy has rather poor physical bulk, being 2HKOed by Choice Band Heracross, for example.

Finally, Thunder Wave allows Clefairy to cripple most of its switch-ins, such as Crobat and Entei, and prevent Pokemon like Feraligatr and Slurpuff from setting up on it freely.

Eviolite is the only viable item on Clefairy, giving it a much-needed increase in bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Clefairy works best on bulky offense teams as a pivot into special attackers such as Hydreigon and Mega Sceptile and as a tool to revive a weakened teammate. Clefairy should use Thunder Wave on expected switches to the likes of Cobalion and Crobat, crippling them and making them vastly easier for a teammate to deal with. Clefairy's offensive teammtes should be preserved in order to revive them late-game with Healing Wish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Abomasnow and Nasty Plot Lucario can take full advantage of Healing Wish and Thunder Wave. Clefairy appreciates teammates that can deal with Fire- and Steel-types; offensive Suicune can deal with many of these threats and also benefits from Healing Wish. Cobalion and Acrobatics Crobat can be useful to switch into Knock Off to help Clefairy preserve its Eviolite against threats such as Krookodile and Mega Absol. Clefairy needs the support of wallbreakers such as Choice Band Tyrantrum that can KO the bulky setup sweepers, such as Suicune and Reuniclus, that it tends to draw in.</p>"

  "Venomoth": {
    "overview": "<p>Venomoth's access to one of the best boosting moves in the game, Quiver Dance, along with its access to Sleep Powder carves its role as a strong offensive sweeper in UU. Tinted Lens makes Venomoth even harder to deal with, rendering most resistances to its attacks useless and allowing it to forgo most coverage in exchange for more utility. A useful Bug / Poison typing grants Venomoth notable resistances to Fighting-, Fairy-, and Grass-type attacks, among others, and provides it with a useful immunity to Toxic and the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes. Venomoth's decent base 90 Speed allows it to outspeed and set up on several bulky offensive Pokemon as well as the entirety of the unboosted tier after a Quiver Dance, but it leaves it slower than most offensive threats and common Choice Scarf users even at +1. Additionally, Venomoth has an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock and poor physical bulk, leaving it rather vulnerable to physical attackers before it sets up and to most priority moves in the tier. Venomoth also struggles to get past some dedicated special walls such as Snorlax and Blissey, though its ability to break them depends on its move selection—for example, Substitute allows Venomoth to beat Porygon2, and Roost allows it to beat non-Thunder Wave variants of Blissey.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wonder Skin is a tempting option, especially on the mono-attacker set, to have a chance of avoiding moves such as Roar and Encore. However, the loss in neutral coverage means that Venomoth will be unable to deal with a huge number of Pokemon, including Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types, which are much more common as answers to Venomoth than these utility moves. Other coverage moves on the offensive set can be used to hit very specific targets, but these moves are almost always not worth it because Venomoth's STAB moves hit nearly everything else harder. Examples of other moves are Shadow Ball to hit Doublade and Chandelure, Psychic to KO Crobat at +1 without Stealth Rock, and Giga Drain to hit bulky Water-types slightly harder while recovering HP in the process. Substitute + Disable is an option to destroy opposing mono-attackers such as Curselax as well as foes such as Calm Mind Reuniclus. Support options such as Toxic Spikes and Tailwind are available, but Venomoth is severely outclassed in this regard by other users of these moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Due to Venomoth's low physical bulk, priority moves stop its sweep when combined with previous damage. In particular, Choice Band Entei's Extreme Speed has a good chance to OHKO Venomoth after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Most Pokemon that commonly run Choice Scarf, especially physical attackers, can outspeed and KO Venomoth unless it's gotten to +2. Examples include Mienshao, Hydreigon, Infernape, and Darmanitan.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Cobalion, Lucario, Mega Aggron, and Doublade can all take hits from +1 Venomoth and retaliate if they avoid getting put to sleep. Specially defensive Forretress can barely take a +1 Life Orb Bug Buzz from full health, can avoid Sleep Powder with Overcoat, and can retaliate with Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Special Walls</strong>: Snorlax and Goodra are examples of Pokemon that can handle Venomoth due their special bulk and various ways of dealing with Sleep Powder. Venomoth can get around Blissey and Porygon2, however, with a mono-attacking set.</p>",

      "Mono-Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance boosts Venomoth's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed and is the only reason to use Venomoth at all. Bug Buzz deals damage and has good neutral coverage with Tinted Lens with no Pokemon immune to it. Roost keeps Venomoth healthy, allowing it to switch into Pokemon such as Florges multiple times throughout the game. Sleep Powder lets Venomoth neutralize one check for a few turns to ease setup or recover health. Substitute can be used over either of the latter two moves to set up comfortably on Thunder Wave users such as Porygon2 and Cresselia lacking Psyshock, as well as mono-attacking Water-types lacking Roar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature allow Venomoth to outspeed threats such as Heracross, Nidoking, and Chandelure before any boosts and Mega Aerodactyl after a boost. Maximum investment is placed into Special Attack to hit as hard as possible, as Venomoth's poor bulk cannot be patched up effectively even with investment. Tinted Lens allows Bug Buzz to hit certain Poison-, Flying-, Fire-, and Steel-types for effectively neutral damage, leaving only 4x resistant Pokemon such as Cobalion, Infernape, Chandelure, and Crobat to truly resist Bug Buzz. Black Sludge allows Venomoth to set up more easily, especially in the face of special attackers such as Nidoqueen and Mega Blastoise. Insect Plate is also an option to give Venomoth a better chance at netting several KOs after a Quiver Dance on threats such as Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best on balanced teams, where Venomoth can come in multiple times throughout the game if needed. Venomoth can set up on and sweep bulkier teams once certain checks have been eliminated, but it shouldn't necessarily go for Quiver Dance until these checks have been weakened or KOed. It can use Sleep Powder on Pokemon such as Entei, which would normally beat it one-on-one. Other times, it should simply use Bug Buzz to whittle down Pokemon such as Whimsicott. Venomoth should attempt to set up mid- to late-game on passive Pokemon such as Florges, special attackers without super effective coverage such as Nidoqueen, or Choice-locked resisted attacks. If Venomoth opts to use Substitute, it should be wary of Infiltrator Crobat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Heliolisk that can weaken Venomoth's checks, such as Doublade and Crobat, can support Venomoth's sweep. Heliolisk can also bring Venomoth in safely with Volt Switch against opposing Florges, Cresselia, and other such Pokemon. Venomoth relies on Stealth Rock to get many KOs, so Pokemon such as Swampert and Mega Aggron are good choices. It also needs teammates such as Calm Mind Reuniclus that can take advantage of special walls. In particular, Krookodile can perform all three of the above roles, especially with Pursuit. Due to Venomoth's Bug typing, it appreciates the removal of Stealth Rock from its side of the field by teammates such as Mandibuzz, especially if it lacks Roost. Empoleon can use Defog or set up Stealth Rock on several of Venomoth's checks.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance boosts Venomoth's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed and is Venomoth's main selling point in the tier. Sleep Powder lets Venomoth incapacitate a foe to potentially gain more attacking or setup opportunities. Bug Buzz acts as Venomoth's main STAB move and has good neutral coverage with Tinted Lens. Sludge Bomb gives Venomoth a neutral attack against most Pokemon that 4x resist Bug Buzz, such as Infernape, Chandelure, and Crobat, and allows Venomoth to hit Florges and Whimsicott super effectively. Hidden Power Ground can be used over Sludge Bomb to hit Cobalion, Lucario, and Doublade harder than any other move, though everything else is hit harder by either Bug Buzz or Sludge Bomb. Psychic is another option in the fourth slot, specifically aiming to eliminate Crobat to support teammates such as Bulk Up Conkeldurr and Nasty Plot Celebi.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature allow Venomoth to outspeed everything up to Timid Rotom formes, Entei, and, after a Quiver Dance, Mega Aerodactyl. Maximum Special Attack investment lets Venomoth hit as hard as possible. With the combination of Tinted Lens and Life Orb, Venomoth hits most common Bug-resistant Pokemon extremely hard; for example, at +1 and with Stealth Rock up, it OHKOes Mega Aerodactyl and has a 75% chance of OHKOing 248 HP Crobat with Sludge Bomb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best on heavily offensive teams as a sweeper against opposing bulky offense and balance teams or as a breaker against more defensive teams. Venomoth should use its typing and Sleep Powder to gain free setup opportunities against Pokemon it cannot beat one-on-one, such as Roar Suicune and Cobalion. Simply bring Venomoth in against an appropriate opposing Pokemon and do as much damage as possible before succumbing to a special wall, Choice Scarf user, priority move, or Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock leads such as Aerodactyl and Froslass that can both set up and prevent entry hazards make for excellent teammates. On bulkier offensive teams that would prefer not to have a suicide lead, Stealth Rock users such as Krookodile and Mega Swampert that provide more utility are options. Venomoth's team should be geared towards keeping Stealth Rock on the opposing side, using spinblockers and Taunt users so that Venomoth can get the necessary KOs on targets such as Crobat and Entei. Pokemon that can take advantage of common holders of Choice Scarf, such as Slurpuff, can possibly clean up a team after Venomoth is KOed. Spikes can aid in wearing down Mega Aggron, Doublade, and Cobalion for Venomoth; Froslass is a Spikes setter that works excellently on the types of teams Venomoth would be on.</p>"

  "Arcanine": {
    "overview": "<p>Arcanine stands out as an offensive Fire-type with great coverage moves such as Crunch, Close Combat, Extreme Speed, and Wild Charge, allowing it to clean up solidly late-game. Arcanine also has a niche as a defensive Fire-type, as Intimidate drops the foe's Attack by one stage, making it a great switch-in to physical attacks. Having decent recovery in Morning Sun also helps its cause; however, Arcanine's huge weakness to Stealth Rock makes it hard to switch in multiple times once entry hazards are set up. Additionally, offensive sets face huge competition from Entei, which has access to the coveted Sacred Fire, as well as higher Attack and uninvested bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Overheat can hit physical walls that try to switch into Arcanine hard, and Arcanine will not receive the nasty recoil associated with Flare Blitz. A Choice Band can be used over Life Orb to hit with more firepower and avoid the recoil taken from Life Orb; however, Arcanine usually appreciates the ability to switch between its coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flash Fire users</strong>: Flash Fire users, especially Chandelure and defensive Arcanine itself, can freely switch into Arcanine's Flare Blitz and get a boost to their own Fire-type moves. Chandelure fears switching into a Toxic or Crunch, however.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Entry hazards severely limit Arcanine's time on the field, as Arcanine is immune to none of them and is weak to Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Even with Wild Charge, most bulky Water-types, such as Alomomola and Suicune, can stall out Arcanine and make it take recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Bulky Rock-types such as Rhyperior can wall Arcanine unless it has Close Combat, which still fails to 2HKO Rhyperior, although it must remain wary of Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, which even resists Extreme Speed, can revenge kill or threaten Arcanine out.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Krookodile, Donphan, and Thick Fat Mamoswine can take on both Arcanine sets without much fear and can force Arcanine out with their respective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Hydreigon and Nidoqueen can hit Arcanine on its uninvested Special Defense.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Morning Sun gives Arcanine a solid way to recover HP; however, be aware of the changes that take place under weather. Will-O-Wisp burns the foe for residual damage and lowers the foe's Attack stat. Toxic can be used for physical walls such as Swampert, which does not take much damage from Arcanine's Flare Blitz, and gives more residual damage than Will-O-Wisp. Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move that hits hard, even without investment, and it prevents Arcanine from being too passive, although the recoil can slowly wear down Arcanine after enough use. Extreme Speed can be used to pick off weakened or faster foes if needed. Roar can be used to force out foes that attempt to set up if Arcanine is not in a position to recover damage from Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Arcanine's physical bulk while allowing it to take less damage from Stealth Rock upon switching in and giving Arcanine a Leftovers number. An Impish nature raises Arcanine's solid physical bulk. Leftovers maximizes Arcanine's time on the field while slightly reducing the damage taken from possible recoil moves and entry hazards. Rocky Helmet is another option to punish common U-turn users such as Mienshao and Crobat. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 196 Def / 64 Spe can be used to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and attempt to KO it with Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arcanine does not appreciate the extra damage taken from Stealth Rock, as upon switching in, losing 25% of its total HP is extremely detrimental and will reduce Arcanine's time on the field tremendously. Arcanine, after an Intimidate, is a fantastic pivot into physical attackers such as Entei, Mienshao, and Heracross. Arcanine appreciates having bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel KOed or at least substantially weakened, as these Pokemon are generally a free switch-in to all of Arcanine's attacks and can force it out. Morning Sun only has 8 PP, so knowing when to recover, usually on an opponent's predicted switch, is vital.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Arcanine appreciates a Defogger or a Rapid Spin user as a partner so it does not have to waste a turn using Morning Sun to recover the damage taken from entry hazards. Mega Blastoise works as a fantastic teammate that can not only clear away entry hazards, but also scare away the Rock-type Pokemon that can threaten Arcanine. Grass-type Pokemon such as Shaymin and Whimsicott can switch in comfortably on most Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Arcanine. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Florges can also switch in on special attacks that were meant for Arcanine.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Arcanine's most powerful attack, and it is backed by high Base Power and STAB. Extreme Speed can hit faster foes such as Mega Beedrill or Mienshao after they have been weakened. Wild Charge does a hefty chunk to bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune, Alomomola, Empoleon, and Tentacruel. Close Combat hits Dark-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Umbreon and Rock-type Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Tyrantrum super effectively. Crunch allows Arcanine to hit Chandelure and Jellicent hard without having to incur severe recoil from Wild Charge. Morning Sun is an option to heal off the massive damage that Arcanine receives from its recoil moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs allow Arcanine to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed allows Arcanine to outspeed Jolly Heracross, Entei and non-Choice Scarf Krookodile. An Adamant nature allows Arcanine to hit harder with its attacks and 2HKO Suicune with Wild Charge after Stealth Rock damage and a small amount of chip damage. Flash Fire allows Arcanine to freely switch into a predicted Fire move, such as Will-O-Wisp, and it boosts Flare Blitz's power to insane levels. Intimidate is an option to give Arcanine fantastic physical bulk even without investment. Life Orb boosts Arcanine's Attack power and gives it the freedom of switching moves; however, it gets worn down quickly with the combination of Life Orb and Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heavy prediction is needed when using Arcanine, as incoming Flash Fire users may get a boost from its Flare Blitz and bulky Water-type Pokemon might get a free switch in. Keep in mind the massive recoil Arcanine receives from the combination of Life Orb and Flare Blitz or Wild Charge, especially if there are entry hazards on the field. Do not switch Arcanine in multiple times when there are entry hazards on your side of the field, as taking 25% upon entry limits Arcanine's time even more.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Considering Arcanine's weakness to Stealth Rock, a Defogger or Rapid Spin user is nearly mandatory as a partner. Empoleon and Mega Blastoise can not only clear hazards, but they can also threaten out Rock-type Pokemon with their STAB attacks. Grass- or Water-type Pokemon such as Chesnaught and Suicune can switch into predicted Ground and Water-type attacks aimed at Arcanine. When using Intimidate, special walls such as Florges and Blissey can freely switch into special attacks that Arcanine might have trouble taking.</p>"

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>Poliwrath has always been at the lower end of Water-types in the lower tiers, but it does have several defensive advantages over many of them. For starters, it has a unique defensive typing in Water / Fighting as well as Water Absorb, giving it a great immunity to Water and resistances to powerful types such as Dark, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Bug. When paired with its good defensive stats, this allows Poliwrath to be one of the few hard counters to both Feraligatr and Suicune, and a great check to Mega Sharpedo,  Krookodile, and Cobalion. It also boasts a great support movepool with moves such as Scald, Circle Throw, Haze, and Encore.</p> <p>However, Poliwrath has to compete with a large number of other Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert, which both have higher defensive stats and can phaze their foes like Poliwrath can. Poliwrath also boasts very little offensive presence, which, in tandem with its lack of a good Fighting-type STAB move, means that it won't be playing any offensive roles. Defensively, it boasts no reliable recovery outside of Rest, and its typing leaves it with crippling weaknesses to Psychic, Flying, Electric, and Grass, which are all good offensive types and can be hard for its teammates to cover.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seismic Toss is an option over Circle Throw, dealing more consistent damage while losing the ability to force Pokemon out. Encore and Toxic can also be run, as the former can lock setup sweepers into their boosting moves and the latter can cripple many of Poliwrath's checks for the rest of the match. An Impish nature can be run over Relaxed to allow Poliwrath to outspeed uninvested base 65 Speed Pokemon, such as Umbreon and Vaporeon, at the cost of lowering Scald's damage output. Hypnosis is another option to lure in most of Poliwrath's counters, but it has rather shaky 60 accuracy. Ice Punch, Brick Break, and Substitute + Focus Punch can all be run as other attacking options; Focus Punch and Brick Break are more powerful STAB options, while Ice Punch can hit Grass- and Flying-types. Although gimmicky, a set with Swift Swim and Belly Drum can be run with rain support to make Poliwrath a rain sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Jellicent</strong>: Jellicent is immune to Circle Throw and Scald by virtue of its Ghost typing and Water Absorb, respectively, allowing it to counter Poliwrath every time.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types can very easily switch into Scald and hit Poliwrath for super effective damage. Shaymin and Roserade both have Natural Cure and are unfazed by Scald burns, so they can switch out and switch back in very easily.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Most Electric-types can easily hit Poliwrath with their STAB attacks. Rotom-C gets a special mention, as it resists Scald.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Most Psychic-types can easily switch in and force Poliwrath out or hit it with their powerful STAB attacks. Hoopa is especially notable, as it's immune to Circle Throw.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Switcheroo Users</strong>: Pokemon that tend to run Trick or Switcheroo with a Choice Scarf can very easily cripple Poliwrath for the rest of the match. In particular, Noivern and Chandelure come to mind, as the former can hit Poliwrath with Air Slash and the latter is immune to Circle Throw.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Most Flying-types can outspeed Poliwrath and hit it with their super effective STAB attacks.</p>",

      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest is Poliwrath's only form of reliable recovery and is a necessity to check physical attackers throughout the game. Sleep Talk allows Poliwrath to continue to do its job while it is asleep by either spreading burns or phazing the foe. Scald is highly spammable and can cripple many physical attackers for the rest of the match. Circle Throw allows Poliwrath to force out setup sweepers and switch-ins, possibly putting the opponent into an unfavorable matchup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Poliwrath a form of passive recovery that allows it to stay in the match longer. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet gives Poliwrath a better way to check contact attackers by dealing damage upon contact. Poliwrath runs maximum HP and Defense EVs to maximize its physical bulk in order to check physical attackers better. Water Absorb restores Poliwrath's HP when it's hit by a Water-type move, allowing it to counter most bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Alomomola by switching into their Scald, which is usually their only damaging move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Poliwrath's good defensive typing allows it to work as a good defensive check to most physical attackers, phaze dangerous setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Curse Snorlax, and check some physical attackers that many other bulky Water-types can't, such as Entei, Krookodile, and Mega Sharpedo. However, Poliwrath should only be used on defensively-oriented teams due to the fact that it can easily kill momentum and doesn't deal much damage. Due to its defensive capabilities, it can force a lot of physical attackers out and can capitalize on this by either forcing out the switch-in with Circle Throw or trying to burn it with Scald.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground- and Rock-types such as Gligar, Donphan, and Rhyperior like having Poliwrath as a partner, as it can easily force out the Water-, Ice-, and Fighting-types that threaten them. Psychic types such as Reuniclus and Cresselia appreciate Poliwrath's ability to check Steel-types, giving them chances to heal or set up. Rotom-H beats the Flying- and Grass-types that check Poliwrath, while Poliwrath checks the Water- and Rock-types that beat Rotom-H in return. Like Rotom-H, many defensive Pokemon, such as Florges, Bronzong, and Mega Aggron, can form nice stall cores with Poliwrath.</p>"

Its diverse movepool, which includes coverage options such as Knock Off and Heavy Slam, allows Machamp to threaten most Fighting-resistant Pokemon in UU. Unlike most of its competitors, though, Machamp is extremely slow, meaning it can't check threats such as Mamoswine and Crawdaunt. Pokemon such as Infernape, Cobalion, and Heracross can use their better Speed, STAB combination, and setup moves to threaten a much wider range of Pokemon. Conkeldurr provides heavy competition with Machamp as well, as the former's access to Mach Punch allows it to perform well against offensive teams.

Knock Off is an ideal coverage move to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively while also removing the items of switch-ins such as Crobat, Milotic, and Gligar. Heavy Slam is a useful move to hit Florges, Sylveon, and Whimsicott hard. Stone Edge hits Crobat and other Flying-types hard as they switch in. Bullet Punch can be used over either of these moves to KO weakened threats and Focus Sash users such as Aerodactyl and Froslass. Ice Punch is also an option to KO Gligar after its Eviolite has been removed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest Machamp can absorb special attacks fairly well from Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Sceptile. 172 HP EVs grant Machamp some much-needed bulk, allowing it to sponge hits from Pokemon such as Hydreigon when used alongside Assault Vest. 84 Speed EVs are used to outspeed all uninvested base 65 Speed Pokemon, including Vaporeon, Umbreon, and Chesnaught. An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs allow Machamp to hit as hard as possible as a physical wallbreaker. No Guard allows Machamp to use Dynamic Punch and get the 100% confusion, which can stop Pokemon such as Suicune, Sylveon, and Cresselia from healing.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Machamp should attempt to remove items from its checks on the switch before hitting them with Dynamic Punch to try to prevent recovery. It can be switched in on special attackers such as Hydreigon to begin wearing down the opposing team. With Dynamic Punch, Machamp does not necessarily have to predict switch-ins, and the move can generally be used safely as long as the opponent doesn't have Sableye, Jellicent, or Doublade.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Machamp works best on bulky offensive teams that need a pivot into Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Mega Blastoise's Hydro Pump. Machamp should be paired with Pokemon such as Krookodile and Hydreigon that can take advantage of a confused Cresselia and Reuniclus.

Knock Off hits bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively and removes the items of its usual switch-ins. Heavy Slam OHKOes both defensive Florges and defensive Sylveon. Stone Edge OHKOes Crobat, a common switch-in to Machamp. Bullet Punch can be useful to pick off weakened threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Slurpuff.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running an Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs ensures that Machamp hits as hard as possible. 252 Speed EVs allow Machamp to outspeed all uninvested base 85 Speed Pokemon, such as Suicune, Gligar, and Cresselia. No Guard pairs excellently with Dynamic Punch, allowing it to create setup and wallbreaking opportunities for its team with guaranteed confusion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Machamp is best used as physical wallbreaker, capable of 2HKOing Pokemon such as Suicune and Milotic. Machamp should usually opt to use its Fighting-type STAB moves when the opposing team lacks a Ghost-type, as predicting incorrectly and locking into Heavy Slam and Stone Edge can be risky. Unfortunately, Choice Band Machamp cannot sponge many hits from other wallbreakers and will fall to most Choice Band-boosted STAB hits and most Flying- and Psychic-type attacks. Therefore, avoid using Choice Band Machamp as a tank, and instead attempt to bring it into the field with the appropriate pivot support or double switching.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Machamp appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support, making Pokemon such as Forretress, Hydreigon, and Crobat ideal partners. Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon appreciate having their checks weakened or eliminated through confusion. Machamp also pairs well with bulky Steel-types, such as Metagross and Empoleon, which can both set up Stealth Rock and take attacks from Crobat and Mega Aeroadactyl.</p>"

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel is the most reliable spinner in the tier, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes thanks to its secondary Poison typing and is neutral to Stealth Rock; however, it fails to be as consistent against Spikes-stacking teams, as it takes more damage from Spikes. Its somewhat unique typing makes it a reliable check to Pokemon such as Cobalion, Infernape, and Doublade. Tentacruel's decent special bulk means that, even uninvested, it is able to take most special attacks with ease. It can also get past potential spinblockers by hitting Chandelure super effectively with its Water-type STAB moves or crippling Doublade and Sableye by burning them with Scald. Tentacruel also has an excellent Speed stat and coverage to run an effective offensive set that breaks through many of its counters, and its useful Fairy resistance allows it to fit more easily on certain teams that may be weak to Florges or Sylveon. However, Tentacruel's below average 80 / 65 physical bulk means that powerful physical attackers can break through it more easily, even with resisted attacks; most notably, it prevents it from being a reliable Fire-type check despite being a Water-type, since Pokemon such as Entei and Swords Dance Infernape can power through and wear it down with burns in the former's case.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off allows Tentacruel to get rid of the foe's item. Giga Drain allows Tentacruel to have some form of recovery on the offensive set outside of Black Sludge while netting super effective coverage on opposing Water-types; however, a non-STAB Grass-type move is doing little to no damage to even bulky super effective targets. Swords Dance is a weird option that can work due to sheer surprise factor, but Tentacruel is normally outclassed as a Swords Dance user by Crawdaunt and Feraligatr except for the fact that it has a better Speed tier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Reuniclus has Magic Guard to prevent them from being whittled down by status and can OHKO Tentacruel with their STAB moves. Gardevoir can also threaten Tentacruel despite being a Fairy-type with its Psychic-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Scald Switch-ins</strong>: Heliolisk and Toxicroak both threaten Tentacruel, as they are immune to Scald. Heliolisk can also hit Tentacruel super effectively with its Electric-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Guts Users</strong>: Heracross and Conkeldurr love being burned by Scald or poisoned by Toxic Spikes, as it boosts their Attack and allows them to overpower Tentacruel despite its resistance to their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Attackers</strong>: Choice Band Entei can 3HKO even defensive Tentacruel with Sacred Fire, crippling Tentacruel with a burn, while Mega Aerodactyl 2HKOes with Earthquake. Krookodile and Mamoswine can also outspeed and OHKO defensive Tentacruel, but offensive Tentacruel takes on all of these Pokemon bar Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune and Milotic can beat Tentacruel one-on-one with Scald and recover off any damage from Tentacruel's Scald or take advantage of Scald's burn in Milotic's case. Slowking is also one of the most reliable answers to Tentacruel, as it has the special bulk to tank Scalds, takes little from an uninvested Knock Off, and has Regenerator + Slack Off to keep itself healthy.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Tentacruel to get rid of entry hazards. Scald gives Tentacruel a nice STAB move that allows it to cripple physical attackers trying to take advantage of its lower defensive stat. Toxic Spikes allows Tentacruel to support the team by putting the foe on a timer. Haze gives Tentacruel a way to check setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Florges and Swords Dance Toxicroak with ease. Acid Spray can be used instead to force switches thanks to the Special Defense drops and rack up Toxic damage in conjunction with Toxic Spikes. It also gives Tentacruel a more reliable way to beat Sableye.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge gives Tentacruel a form of passive recovery. 24 Speed EVs allow Tentacruel to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Honchkrow, while the remaining EVs are dumped into HP and Defense to allow Tentacruel to take resisted hits better. A Bold nature further bolsters Tentacruel's less-than-stellar Defense stat. Liquid Ooze allows Tentacruel to check certain Grass-types, such as Celebi lacking a Psychic STAB move more easily as well as punish Pokemon trying to drain its HP such as Toxicroak. Other Speed benchmarks Tentacruel can hit, with a Timid nature, are 96 Speed EVs to outspeed Mamoswine and Chandelure, 136 EVs to outspeed Nidoking and Heracross, and 148 to outspeed Adamant Entei. It is possible to run a set with an EV spread of 248 HP / 132 Def / 104 SpD / 24 Spe and a Calm nature to more reliably take on certain threats on stall and slower balanced teams such as SubCM Chandelure while making use of Tentacruel's decent special bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tentacruel is best used on more balanced or defensive teams, as its lack of power and bulk means it can't hit Pokemon hard or tank hits as well as it wants to. Scald is Tentacruel's way of dealing damage, but its mediocre Special Attack stat prevents it from OHKOing even targets that are hit super effectively such as Krookodile and Mamoswine. Be careful when switching it in on powerful physical attackers like Entei, as even resisted hits can deal a lot of damage to it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types such as Escavalier and Doublade are really good partners for Tentacruel, as they provide some defensive synergy, making for a very potent and balanced core. Clerics such as Florges and Sylveon can not only get rid of status such as burns, which Tentacruel hates, but they can also take care of most Fighting-types that it can't while also providing Tentacruel with Wish support, allowing it to stick around throughout the match. Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Krookodile can be very effective partners for Tentacruel, as they provide amazing defensive synergy by granting a Psychic immunity and are able to break through bulky Psychic-types that Tentacruel has trouble with such as Cresselia and Reuniclus. Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Gligar provide an Electric immunity and appreciate Tentacruel's ability to wear down bulkier Pokemon with Toxic Spikes. Swampert is a really nice option, as it can provide Stealth Rock support, and it is a better Fire-type check despite sharing a Water typing with Tentacruel. Sableye can reliably break stall with Taunt and spinblock for Tentacruel, allowing both of them to pressure the opponent. Snorlax is another good partner for Tentacruel, as it can hard check Entei without stacking weaknesses with Tentacruel. Tentacruel also checks Infernape and Cobalion for Snorlax while providing Toxic Spikes. Setup sweepers, such as Swords Dance Cobalion and Calm Mind Cresselia, appreciate the Toxic Spikes support, as it allows them to break past bulky Pokemon they otherwise couldn't such as Suicune.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump allows Tentacruel to hit as hard as possible against Fire-types such as Entei and Chandelure. Sludge Bomb gives Tentacruel a powerful STAB move for opposing Grass- and Fairy-types such as Celebi, Shaymin, and Sylveon. It also allows Tentacruel to hit Water-types fairly hard while threatening them with a chance to poison. Ice Beam is Tentacruel's best coverage move, as it hits opposing Dragon-types such as Hydreigon super effectively. Rapid Spin allows Tentacruel to support the team by getting rid of entry hazards. Toxic Spikes can be used if the team itself doesn't require entry hazard control to break bulkier teams. Acid Spray is another option over Sludge Bomb to allow Tentacruel to force out Calm Mind Florges and Sylveon, as Sludge Bomb will do less damage over time. It also gives Tentacruel a reliable way of breaking Sableye. Dazzling Gleam is another option that, when coupled with Expert Belt, can 2HKO Sableye and OHKO Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature allow Tentacruel to make use of its base 100 Speed stat to outspeed threats that could otherwise revenge kill it such as Krookodile and Hydreigon while also keeping up with other positive-natured base 100s. Black Sludge allows Tentacruel to keep its passive recovery and tank resisted hits. Expert Belt, on the other hand, allows Tentacruel to deal more damage to targets that are hit super effectively. Shuca Berry can also provide Tentacruel the ability to tank one Ground-type attack and fire off a powerful Hydro Pump. Clear Body allows Tentacruel to be unaffected by stat drops from Sticky Web or Florges's Moonblast.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tentacruel should be used on more offensive teams that are in need of a Pokemon to remove entry hazards. Tentacruel should only be switching into resisted or neutral special hits, as any strong physical hit will put a major dent into it. Tentacruel should also be more careful when getting rid of entry hazards, as it lacks bulk investment, so it can't stay in the match for long.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that dislike entry hazards such as Sylveon and Mega Aerodactyl appreciate Tentacruel's ability to get rid of Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes while still keeping up the offensive pressure. On the other hand, these same offensive Pokemon also appreciate Toxic Spikes support to break past bulky Pokemon such as Swampert and Porygon2. Stealth Rock users such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Krookodile are nice additions, as Tentacruel can beat Pokemon that otherwise threaten them such as opposing Krookodile, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Mamoswine. Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Absol can take care of Psychic-types for Tentacruel, while Tentacruel can use its Poison-type STAB moves to deal with Fairies. Ground-types such as Mamoswine provide a more reliable answer to Fire-types while sporting an Electric immunity. Mega Swampert is also an option, as it appreciates Tentacruel's ability to get rid of hazards, and Tentacruel can take advantage of the rain Mega Swampert sets if necessary.</p>"

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>Magneton is one of the more unique Electric-types in the tier, mainly due to its solid abilities in Magnet Pull and Analytic; the former allows Magneton to trap Steel-types and weaken them severely or potentially OHKO them in order to support its teammates in sweeping, while the latter turns Magneton into a dangerous wallbreaker when coupled with Choice Specs. Magneton also has a great typing both offensively and defensively, as it has a good STAB combination that hits a large portion of the tier for at least neutral damage and it also has the most resistances to offer for any Pokemon, which makes it easy for it to switch in and pressure the foe. However, Magneton has many flaws that hold it back, including a mediocre base 70 Speed that leaves it outpaced and threatened by a number of offensive threats. Its bulk is also middling, even when boosted by Eviolite, thanks to its low HP stat, and it also has to deal with weaknesses to common offensive types. Its movepool also leaves much to be desired, as it has very little to work with aside from Hidden Power for coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magneton can run a Choice Scarf set to patch up its average Speed stat, but this makes it much weaker and it isn't as fast as other Choice Scarf users. Magnet Rise with Eviolite can be run so that Magneton won't have to worry about Ground-type moves. Charge Beam is an option to boost Magneton's Special Attack and can turn Magneton into a decent win condition, but it usually does not have the room in its moveset to run this. Sturdy can be used if you need Magneton to serve as a backup check to offensive threats; however, this requires Magneton to not take any damage, which can be difficult due to entry hazards, and is not as useful as Magnet Pull or Analytic. Endure + Custap Berry is also an option for Magneton to check offensive threats in an emergency.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with large natural Special Defense, such as Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon, can switch into Magneton's attacks and can heal off the damage with little trouble, although it is a little more difficult for the latter two to switch in if Magneton is running Analytic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Swampert, Seismitoad, and Quagsire are all good switch-ins to Magneton, as they are immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch and don't mind taking damage from Flash Cannon, although they must be wary of Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive variants of Gligar can switch into Flash Cannon and heal off the damage, but it must be careful of Hidden Power Ice. Other Ground-types such as Krookodile, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking also put pressure on Magneton by preventing it from using Volt Switch too freely, but they cannot switch in on Flash Cannon, Hidden Power Ice, or Hidden Power Grass repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Fast, powerful Pokemon such as Infernape, Nidoking, Entei, Heracross, and Mienshao can take advantage of Magneton's mediocre Speed and either revenge kill it or force it out. However, none of them can directly switch into Magneton's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Offensive variants of Mega Ampharos, Heliolisk, and Rotom-H can all switch into Magneton's STAB attacks and hit Magneton for super effective damage with a coverage move or, in Rotom-H's case, Overheat. Jolteon is also a solid answer because it regains HP if hit by Volt Switch or Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Flash Cannon are Magneton's primary STAB attacks, which have good coverage just by themselves, hitting important Pokemon in the tier such as Empoleon, Sylveon, Suicune, and Crobat for super effective damage. Volt Switch is used to keep offensive momentum while doing a decent amount of damage to most targets, as well as gradually wearing down Magneton's potential switch-ins. The Hidden Power type of choice can usually be adjusted to preference; Hidden Power Ice hits Gligar and Mega Sceptile for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Grass gets a nice super effective hit against Swampert and Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is self-explanatory, as maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed is used to make Magneton as fast and powerful as possible. A Timid nature is used to maximize Magneton's Speed, but a Modest nature is an option if you care more about Magneton's wallbreaking potential. Magnet Pull is used to trap Steel-types and weaken or KO them so that Magneton's teammates can have an easier time setting up and sweeping, although Analytic is an option if you prefer doing more damage overall.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Magneton can trap and weaken Steel-types such as Empoleon and Forretress, it should be kept healthy until threats to it have been removed. Because Ground-types are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt, Magneton should play cautiously around them, and it should use Flash Cannon if a switch to a Pokemon that resists Electric will be forced. Hidden Power should only be used if you're certain that the opponent will bring out a Pokemon that can be hit for super effective damage, as Hidden Power is otherwise very weak. Volt Switch should be used to gain momentum if Thunderbolt won't KO an incoming switch-in, as it lets Magneton switch into an appropriate answer to what the opponent brings in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Magneton is able to trap and weaken Steel-types, Pokemon that appreciate their removal, such as Slurpuff, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Haxorus, pair well with Magneton, because Steel-types such as Forretress can impede their sweep. Pokemon that can keep up offensive momentum with Magneton and form a VoltTurn core with it are also good partners, including Mega Beedrill, Crobat, and Mienshao. As Ground-types can stop Magneton from gaining momentum through Volt Switch, Pokemon that can remove these threats are appreciated; Shaymin, Swampert, and Suicune are prime examples of teammates that can fulfill this role. Magneton also benefits from entry hazard support, as many of its answers are worn down by having them in play, and in turn Magneton can deal with common hazard removers such as Empoleon and Forretress. Again, Swampert is a very good partner, as it can deal with Fire- and Ground-types such as Darmanitan and Krookodile while also being able to set up Stealth Rock easily and also works well with Magneton's ability to check Water-types such as Suicune. Other entry hazard setters such as Roserade and Qwilfish also pair well with Magneton.</p>"

Cloyster has an amazing 180 Defense stat, though it has a mediocre HP stat and subpar defensive typing. Every other stat is either average or below average on Cloyster. Contrary to Cloyster's typing from a defensive point of view, Cloyster actually has quite the good offensive typing. Lastly, Cloyster has access to Skill Link, which is an ability that complements its movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be used to get surprise revenge kills on quick Pokemon such as Infernape and Crobat, although it lacks a lot of Speed and hits weakly without the boosts from Shell Smash. Razor Shell can be used on the last slot of the main set but is outclassed by Hydro Pump. Cloyster has access to Rapid Spin, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, but a set utilizing these moves is generally a bad idea due to Cloyster's inability to perform the role adequately as compared to other Pokemon such as Forretress. A specially offensive or specially biased Shell Smash set can be used but lacks the sweeping potential the physical and mixed sets have. White Herb, King's Rock, and Lum Berry are options for the item on the main set but are either generally outclassed, luck-reliant, or extremely situational in that order.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types that have a decently high Defense stat such as Suicune, Alomomola, and Blastoise can take a +2 Rock Blast from Cloyster and retaliate with a potential burn from Scald.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types can take any hit Cloyster can throw at them at +2 and retaliate, although they might not take it well after being weakened.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Priority Moves</strong>: Fighting-type priority moves such as Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch can easily check Cloyster, as its only form of priority is Ice Shard which won't even 2HKO users of each move.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls</strong>: Mixed walls such as Cresselia and Porygon2 can take any one hit from Cloyster at +2 and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Empoleon</strong>: Empoleon resists every move Cloyster can throw at it, although the specially defensive variant has a chance to be OHKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Explosion after a Shell Smash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "The Janitor (Shell Smash)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash is mandatory on this set, as it allows Cloyster to sweep opposing teams late-game. Icicle Spear is its best STAB attack that hits 125 Base Power after all 5 hits and can also break Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Rock Blast is great coverage for Cloyster and can break through the aforementioned Focus Sashes and Sturdy due to Skill Link. Explosion is a nice option, as it allows Cloyster to remove some of its supposed checks and counters for other Pokemon to clean up the mess. Ice Shard gives Cloyster a form of priority to sweep past other priority users when they are at low health such as Honchkrow and Toxicroak, whereas Hydro Pump is a great STAB option that allows Cloyster to remove checks such as Mega Aggron and Bronzong after prior damage and a boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs allow Cloyster to have maximum sweeping potential. The remaining 4 EVs are put into either Special Attack or Special Defense stats depending on whether Hydro Pump is being used. A Jolly or Naive nature is used to maximize Speed, allowing Cloyster to outspeed every Choice Scarf user in the tier up to Infernape. A Focus Sash is used to allow Cloyster to live any one hit and guarantee that Cloyster can use a Shell Smash whereas a Life Orb allows extra damage output, which is crucial when using Explosion or Hydro Pump.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cloyster should be sent in to clean the remains of the enemy team, especially after all its counters and checks have either been removed or severely weakened. Try to clear out entry hazards from your side of the field so that Cloyster's Focus Sash remains intact or, if using a Life Orb, you can bluff a Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters and removers, Volt Switch and U-turn users, and wallbreakers all work well with Cloyster. Forretress deserves a special mention for being able to fulfill the three former roles. Aggron and Froslass can also fulfill the entry hazard setter role. Heliolisk and Infernape make for good Volt Switch and U-turn partners. Crobat and Tentacruel can remove entry hazards fairly well. Life Orb Hydreigon and Choice Band Darmanitan can break the walls that hinder Cloyster. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Darmanitan can utilize Cloyster's Explosion, which removes most of the bulky Water-types, most notably Suicune and Alomomola.</p>"

  "Hitmonlee": {
    "overview": "<p>While being an offensive hazard remover in a metagame where entry hazard removal in general is limited may seem appealing, Hitmonlee has fatal flaws that prevent it from fulfilling that role to a decent extent. Such flaws include being rather slow at base 87 Speed for such a frail Pokemon, competition from better Fighting-types to use in general, and the inability to beat many entry hazard setters due to the aforementioned low Speed and frailty. Hitmonlee also fails to perform a cleaner role effectively due to its lack of raw power, even with a Liechi Berry, the fact it can only attempt a sweep once per game, and its vulnerability to being revenge killed by any priority moves due to it always attempting to sweep at 1 HP.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up is an option to boost Hitmonlee's Attack and Defense, but Hitmonlee finds barely any setup opportunities due to his frailty. Fake Out + Normal Gem alongside Unburden is an option to quickly double Hitmonlee's Speed, but he prefers the power given by Liechi Berry. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types super effectively, but Hitmonlee lacks room for the move, and Florges is 2HKOed by High Jump Kick anyway. Sucker Punch can be used for a stronger priority move, but it is easy to play around and incompatible with Unburden. Earthquake hits Poison-types for decent damage, but it is difficult to fit the move into Hitmonlee's moveset. Double-Edge is very powerful alongside Reckless and can 2HKO a lot of physical walls, including Weezing and Nidoqueen, but the recoil will wear Hitmonlee down very quickly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, and Slowking can easily take Hitmonlee's STAB attacks and even repeated Knock Offs. However, none of them can switch into Knock Off, and they all despise having their items removed.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Florges, Whimsicott, and Aromatisse can take one hit from Hitmonlee and KO it back with their STAB moves. However, all of them are 2HKOed by High Jump Kick.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Offensive Flying-types such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat can beat Hitmonlee with their STAB attacks but must be wary of Stone Edge. Gligar resists High Jump Kick and can Toxic stall Hitmonlee, but Knock Off removes its Eviolite, taking away much of its walling potential.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Crobat, Nidoqueen, and Toxicroak resist Hitmonlee's STAB attacks and usually don't take much damage from Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Toxic poison damage from the likes of Forretress and Vaporeon quickly wears down Hitmonlee. Paralysis from Thunder Wave users such as Mega Aggron and Galvantula leaves Hitmonlee unable to sweep through teams without taking a hit. Will-O-Wisp users such as Arcanine and Rotom-H can burn Hitmonlee, cutting his Attack in half while inflicting passive damage.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: As Hitmonlee is very physically frail, strong priority moves such as Fletchinder's Acrobatics, Feraligatr's Aqua Jet, and Infernape's Mach Punch can KO or severely damage him. However, none of these priority attackers enjoy taking a High Jump Kick.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is an incredibly powerful STAB move that gets a damage boost from Reckless. Knock Off hits the Psychic- and Ghost-types that resist or are immune to High Jump Kick and punishes switch-ins by removing their items. Rapid Spin allows Hitmonlee to support his team by removing entry hazards from his side of the field; he makes for a solid offensive spinner because of his resistance to Stealth Rock. Mach Punch is a decently powerful STAB priority move that can pick off a weakened foe.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed makes Hitmonlee hit as hard and as quickly as possible. Reckless increases the power of High Jump Kick, while Life Orb further increases the power of all of Hitmonlee's moves. An Adamant nature is necessary to let Hitmonlee 2HKO Florges and Chesnaught on the switch, though a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed maximum Speed Chandelure, Rotom-H, Rotom-C, and Kingdra.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hitmonlee is a solid choice early- or mid-game in order to wear down opposing walls, thus paving the way for one of his teammates to switch in and clean up the opposing team. Do not use High Jump Kick too recklessly, however, as Hitmonlee will be punished dearly if the foe uses Protect or a Ghost-type switches in. Generally, Knock Off should be used on predicted switch-ins in order to remove the foe's item, as well as against Pokemon that commonly carry Protect. Though Hitmonlee makes for a decent late-game cleaner with Mach Punch, the somewhat low Base Power of Mach Punch and Hitmonlee's average Speed mean that he should not be your team's primary cleaner.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dedicated late-game sweepers such as Crobat and Mega Beedrill benefit from Hitmonlee's wallbreaking, which gives them an easier time finishing off the opposing team. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Tornadus, Entei, and Crobat, appreciate Hitmonlee's Rapid Spin support. Clerics such as Florges and Umbreon rid Hitmonlee of crippling status effects and also restore his HP, making it easier for him to break down opposing walls. Entry hazard setters such as Empoleon and Forretress allow Hitmonlee to land crucial KOs that he could not achieve otherwise. For example, High Jump Kick is guaranteed to 2HKO physically defensive Florges when Hitmonlee has Stealth Rock support. Sticky Web support from Galvantula or Shuckle can be used to allow Hitmonlee to outspeed some of his offensive checks. Electric-types such as Mega Ampharos and Rotom-H can counter the Flying-types that give Hitmonlee trouble. Psychic-types such as Celebi and Espeon deal with the Poison-types that resist High Jump Kick. A slow user of Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Forretress, can provide a free switch for Hitmonlee so that he does not have to take a hit when he enters the battlefield.</p>"

      "Endure + Reversal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Endure guarantees that Hitmonlee will survive any attack and be left with at least 1 HP. It has great synergy with Reversal, which becomes more powerful as Hitmonlee's HP decreases. Knock Off hits the Psychic- and Ghost-types that do not fear Reversal and removes the items of opposing switch-ins. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Gyarados and Crobat, which would otherwise wall this set. Alternatively, Mach Punch allows Hitmonlee to land some damage against opposing priority users, particularly Feraligatr and Infernape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Attack and Speed is necessary to maximize Hitmonlee's offensive presence. 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense make Hitmonlee as frail as possible so that he will be brought to low health after Enduring an attack. Liechi Berry raises Hitmonlee's Attack once he is brought down to low HP, while Unburden doubles Hitmonlee's Speed after he consumes his Liechi Berry. A Lonely nature is necessary for Hitmonlee to hit even harder; he does not need a Hasty nature because he already outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and Choice Scarf users with up to base 115 Speed after he loses his item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a dedicated late-game cleaner. Before attempting a Hitmonlee sweep, try to eliminate or at least wear down the foes that resist Fighting and Ghost. Pokemon that can inflict status ailments should also be removed quickly because poison and burn damage will KO Hitmonlee after Endure brings him down to 1 HP, while paralysis renders the Speed boost from Unburden moot. When predicting an attack, use Endure in order to ensure that Hitmonlee will survive it. Conversely, use Knock Off against predicted switch-ins in order to remove their items.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from the likes of Nidoqueen and Forretress allows Hitmonlee to land KOs more easily. Heal Bell support from Florges, Umbreon, or Sylveon prevents poison and burn damage from KOing Hitmonlee through Endure and prevents paralysis from ruining the Speed boost provided by Unburden. A powerful wallbreaker such as Darmanitan can wear down the opposing team, making it easier for Hitmonlee to come in and sweep. Entry hazard removers and grounded Poison-types such as Forretress and Dragalge, respectively, can remove Toxic Spikes in order to prevent Hitmonlee from becoming poisoned. Fairy-types are huge problems for this Hitmonlee variant, so Steel- and Poison-types such as Mega Aggron and Nidoking, respectively, make for good partners. Pokemon that resist Flying, such as Rotom-H and Mega Aerodactyl, can take on the Flying-types that check Hitmonlee. Poison-types resist Hitmonlee's STAB moves and usually do not take much from Knock Off, so Ground- and Psychic-types such as Swampert and Metagross can deal with them.</p>"

  "Tangela": {
    "overview": "<p>While it is a very niche option at best, Tangela has found its place on UU stall teams thanks to its monstrous Defense stat when holding an Eviolite. With Regenerator, Tangela can repeatedly switch out in order to remain healthy throughout the match. Given its typing and high physical bulk, Tangela offers stall teams a hard counter to most of the offensive Water-types in UU such as Crawdaunt, Feraligatr, Mega Swampert, and Mega Sharpedo. Tangela complements its already impressive bulk with a solid array of support moves such as Knock Off, Leech Seed, and Sleep Powder.</p> <p>However, Tangela heavily relies on Eviolite to maintain its respectable bulk, making it extremely vulnerable to the fairly common move, Knock Off. Even with its Eviolite, its special bulk is horrid given its base Special Defense stat of 40. Tangela is also vulnerable to all entry hazards, decreasing the effectiveness of Regenerator if they are not cleared. Tangela also faces stiff competition from Chesnaught as a physically defensive Grass-type on stall teams, as the latter offers Spikes, a solid Dark-type resistance, and well-rounded stats, while Tangela's only real advantages are its access to Regenerator and slightly higher Defense.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sleep Powder, Toxic, and Stun Spore are decent options to cripple foes, but they are far less useful than the moves on the set in most cases. Synthesis can be used over Leech Seed to remain as healthy as possible, but Tangela generally prefers Leech Seed's passive damage on foes while gaining HP back itself, as well as its ability to pressure bulky setup sweepers in conjunction with Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Hydreigon, Celebi, Nidoqueen, and Kyurem can all potentially deal heavy damage to Tangela.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Tangela is heavily reliant on Eviolite to maintain its respectable defenses; however, it does check common Knock Off users such as Krookodile and Crawdaunt regardless of whether not its held item has been removed.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status conditions such as poison and burn severely hamper Tangela's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Strong Fire-types such as Entei, Chandelure, and Infernape all threaten Tangela with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types such as Heracross and Mega Beedrill threaten Tangela with their respective STAB moves and force it out.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is Tangela's main STAB move, providing reliable damage and a decent amount of recovery. Leech Seed is primarily used for passive damage on bulky setup sweepers such as Snorlax and Suicune while also aiding Tangela in remaining healthy throughout the match. Knock Off is a solid utility option used for removing the items of opposing Pokemon, specifically the Leftovers of bulkier Pokemon, allowing the rest of the team to wear them down more effectively. Hidden Power Fire lets Tangela beat offensive Steel-types such as Swords Dance Cobalion and Lucario one-on-one. Protect is essential for Tangela to take on Substitute + Dragon Dance Gyarados, as it completely neutralizes Bounce. It also lets it scout for the moves of Choice item users and play accordingly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment along with a Bold nature allows Tangela to take on physical attackers as well as possible, more specifically Krookodile and offensive Water-types such as Crawdaunt, Feraligatr, Mega Swampert, and Mega Sharpedo. While Tangela acts as a mixed attacker if running Knock Off, it does not mind the Attack drop from a Bold nature, as the move is used purely to get rid of opposing items. Eviolite gives Tangela's defenses sizable boosts, notably increasing its Defense stat to an astronomical level. Regenerator is used to keep Tangela as healthy as possible while it switches in and out throughout the course of a match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tangela should be brought in on physically offensive Water-types such as Crawdaunt or bulky setup sweepers such as Suicune and Snorlax, which ordinarily threaten stall teams. Tangela should use Knock Off early-game in order for the rest of the team to wear down its targets more efficiently. Be wary of opposing Knock Off users, as Tangela is extremely dependent on Eviolite, though it does beat common users of the move such as Krookodile and Crawdaunt one-on-one. If Tangela falls to a low amount of HP, switch it out to recover some of the damage with Regenerator. Tangela should avoid staying in on strong special attackers, as its Special Defense is extremely low, even with Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most of Tangela's partners are bulky, so it should be used exclusively on stall teams. Alomomola forms a nice Regenerator core with Tangela while taking on many of the Fire-types that threaten it. The two can also switch between each other to stall out Sableye, which is otherwise a huge threat to some stall teams. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey can take on many of the special attackers that Tangela struggles with. Heal Bell support is heavily appreciated from Blissey and Sylveon as well, as Tangela is easily worn down when poisoned or burned. Pokemon that can reliably switch into Knock Off such as Hydreigon and Mandibuzz are solid options alongside Tangela, as it depends on Eviolite to maintain its physical bulk. Entry hazard removers such as Gligar, Crobat, and Mandibuzz pair nicely with Tangela given its vulnerability to all forms of hazards. Grounded Poison-types such as Nidoqueen are also appreciated, as they remove Toxic Spikes, which is especially annoying for Tangela, upon entry.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<p>Gyarados's all-around typing with great resistances to Fire, Ground, and Fighting allows it to check a plethora of common threats in UU such as Infernape and Mamoswine; however, a 4x weakness to Electric as well as a Stealth Rock weakness hinders both its defensive and offensive capabilities. Its decent STAB moves in Waterfall and Bounce coupled with its coverage options and access to Dragon Dance make it an amazing setup sweeper. However, despite having quite a few options, Gyarados has a hard time fitting all the coverage it needs to sweep. It has access to two incredible abilities, with Intimidate providing setup opportunities and Moxie allowing Gyarados to snowball out of control after netting an OHKO or two. One major downside for Gyarados, especially the defensive set, is its lack of reliable recovery outside of Rest, forcing it to sit out while the foes can potentially power through it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moxie is a really nice option on the offensive set for Gyarados, as it can help it muscle more easily past it checks. Power Herb is a decent item to use, as it can get around the charge turn on Bounce one time to make sure to OHKO bulky Grass-types. However, Gyarados would sorely miss Leftovers's recovery or Life Orb's power boost, and it doesn't guarantee that Gyarados will get rid of the bulky Grass-types. Crunch is a nice coverage option to get around bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Reuniclus. Rest + Chesto Berry gives Gyarados a one-time recovery move after setting up, allowing it to boost and get rid of crippling status in one fell swoop.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Chesnaught can check Gyarados if it happens to have Spiky Shield to negate Bounce and a Grass-type STAB move to prevent Gyarados from setting up in its face. Roar does this as well by phazing Gyarados. Porygon2 can fully counter Gyarados with Discharge and Thunderbolt, as the former can cripple it while the latter is an OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon outspeed Gyarados at +1 and can KO or cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Heliolisk, Mega Ampharos and Rotom-C can all tank Gyarados's unboosted attacks and proceed to OHKO back with their STAB moves, as Gyarados is 4x weak to them. They must, however, watch out for Gyarados's coverage, as it can hit them super effectively, in the former two's case with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune and Empoleon can tank both of Gyarados's STAB moves and can proceed to phaze it with Roar; however, Empoleon must watch out for a boosted Earthquake should it lack Shuca Berry. Milotic also gets a special mention, as it can stall out Bounce and Dragon Dance with Haze and access to reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Pokemon</strong>: Whimsicott can Encore Gyarados into Dragon Dance and gain momentum via U-turn, while Sableye can burn Gyarados, rendering it useless if its Lum Berry has been consumed or it doesn't have Lum Berry.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute gives Gyarados an immunity to status moves, which can cut its sweep short. Dragon Dance is the obligatory setup move, giving Gyarados sweeping potential after just one boost. Waterfall is Gyarados's main STAB move, hitting most of the tier for great neutral damage as well as hitting Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Entei and Krookodile super effectively. Bounce is the best option Gyarados has for a Flying STAB move, and it still allows Gyarados to hit Grass-types, such as Roserade and Shaymin, as well as hitting Pokemon with Water immunities, such as Toxicroak and Heliolisk. However, since it is a two-turn move, the opponent can just switch out to something that can tank the hit. Earthquake is an option over Bounce that doesn't require to wait a turn before it hits and hits common switch-ins such as Empoleon and Heliolisk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Gyarados to outspeed positive-natured base 80s such as Chandelure and Mamoswine and OHKO them with its Water-type STAB move as well as outspeed Mega Sceptile and Mega Beedrill at +1. Leftovers is best used with Substitute, as it provides Gyarados with a form of passive recovery, allowing for more potential Substitutes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set aims to set up on Water-types that lack a phazing option such as Alomomola and CroCune. Gyarados is meant to pivot in and out early- to mid-game, using Intimidate to check physical threats such as Mamoswine and Infernape. It must be wary of Stealth Rock being on the field, as it chips 25% of Gyarados's HP every time it switches in. Gyarados shouldn't set up until mid- or late-game when certain checks such as Empoleon and Heliolisk are gone or worn down to the point of being OHKOed at +1. Gyarados should only be switching in on physical threats, as its Stealth Rock weakness and its lack of bulk investment make it hard to tank hits as well as it wants to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types such as Krookodile, Swampert, and Nidoqueen can provide amazing defensive synergy, as they are immune to Electric and resist Rock. They both can set Stealth Rock as well, aiding in a Gyarados sweep. Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade can help break down bulky Water-types that can cripple Gyarados with a Scald burn or force it out via Roar. Pokemon such as Gligar, Mandibuzz, and Forretress can remove Stealth Rock via Defog or Rapid Spin, which otherwise severely hinders Gyarados's opportunities to switch in. Other setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Cobalion and Swords Dance Lucario can partner with Gyarados to wear down each other's checks and counters, paving the way for either one to set up and sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance + Three Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance gives Gyarados a way to boost its Attack and Speed in one move. Waterfall is Gyarados's main STAB move, hitting Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Chandelure and Mamoswine super effectively. Bounce is the only good Flying-type STAB Gyarados has access to. It gives Gyarados the ability to hit Grass-types, such as Chesnaught, as well as hitting Pokemon with Water immunities, such as Toxicroak, hard; however, it is requires two turns, which can allow the opponent to just switch to their Gyarados check. Earthquake provides Gyarados with a super effective move against Pokemon that typically can check it such as Empoleon and Heliolisk. Double-Edge has decent neutral coverage and hits as hard as Waterfall without requiring a charge turn like Bounce, but it leaves Gyarados walled by Empoleon and Jellicent. Stone Edge allows Gyarados to eliminate opposing Gyarados that try to set up themselves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Gyarados to outspeed positive-natured base 80s such as Gardevoir as well as faster Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill at +1. Lum Berry is the optimal choice to prevent status from crippling Gyarados, while Life Orb can be nice to provide Gyarados with more initial power but leaves it susceptible to status and being worn down quicker. Charti Berry is also a nice option to allow Gyarados to tank a Stone Edge from Mega Aerodactyl, which outspeeds it at +1, and proceed to finish it off with a STAB Waterfall.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gyarados shouldn't be coming in until late-game when walls have been weakened and, if it doesn't carry a Lum Berry, status users have been eliminated. Most of its checks don't have to be gone, but rather weakened, thanks to this set running more than one coverage move. The Stealth Rock weakness also means that Gyarados can't pivot as easily as it wants to despite being a nice check to Mamoswine and Infernape. If Gyarados lacks Lum Berry, it should avoid status at all costs, as any status ailment can cause it problems.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mamoswine is a nice partner, as it provides an Electric immunity and can weaken a lot of Gyarados's checks, giving it an easier time setting up. Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Shaymin are even more important for this set, as they can break down bulky Water-types that can cripple Gyarados with a Scald burn, while Gyarados can use special walls to set up and overpower the opposing team. Healing Wish users such as Gardevoir can allow Gyarados to play more aggressively, as it can potentially set up and sweep again. Entry hazard support from Cobalion, Forretress, and Swampert can be really helpful in aiding in a Gyarados sweep. Forretress can also provide entry hazard removal to get rid of Stealth Rock and a slow Volt Switch to bring Gyarados in safely.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest + Sleep Talk gives Gyarados a form of recovery that can also rid it of status and allows it to continuously check the plethora of physical threats this set is meant to check such as Infernape, Mamoswine, Entei, and Cobalion. Waterfall hits the Fire- and Ground-types that Gyarados tends to switch into super effectively. Roar allows Gyarados to phaze certain setup sweepers such as Cobalion, Suicune, and Reuniclus. Toxic gives Gyarados an option to cripple bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Suicune, Swampert, and Chesnaught, which can comfortably take Gyarados's Water-type STAB. Thunder Wave is another viable option over Toxic to give the team a form of speed control, and Gyarados's access to STAB Waterfall means Gyarados can paraflinch fairly well. Scald, coupled with Roar, allows Gyarados to phaze while burning the foe, making it a very effective status spreader.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is the best item for Gyarados, as it gives it a form of passive recovery, allowing it to continue taking hits. An Impish nature further bolsters Gyarados's Defense stat. The EV spread maximizes Leftovers recovery, provides an extra point in Defense, and hits enough Speed to outspeed Crawdaunt. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense to give Gyarados a much better chance of surviving Infernape's +2 Grass Knot after Stealth Rock with Leftovers. It also avoids the 2HKO from Adamant Life Orb Mamoswine after Stealth Rock with the given nature and Intimidate factored in. Rocky Helmet is also a nice option to punish U-turn users as well as getting chip damage on foes if they try to use Knock Off against Gyarados. This particular set works well on entry hazard-stacking teams, as Roar can gain a ton of chip damage on the foes while potentially stopping any sweepers from setting up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gyarados should pivot in on common physical threats such as Mamoswine, Cobalion, and Infernape, as its invested bulk and Intimidate allow it to take repeated hits. It must watch out for Stealth Rock, as that cuts into its bulk heavily, leaving it susceptible to being overpowered.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards from the likes of Forretress, Swampert, and Roserade complement this set very nicely, as they allow Gyarados to rack up chip damage via Roar. Forretress can also provide entry hazard removal, which aids Gyarados's longevity, as Stealth Rock chips away 25% of its HP every time it switches in. However, most Defoggers such as Crobat and Empoleon stack weaknesses with Gyarados, making it difficult to keep entry hazards off Gyarados's side of the field. Special walls such as Blissey and Sylveon are good partners, as they appreciate Gyarados's ability to take most physical attacks while they can tank most special attacks aimed at Gyarados. Krookodile and Cobalion can be really helpful in wearing down the opposing team, as they can provide Stealth Rock support. Ground-types such as Swampert and Nidoqueen resist Rock-type moves and are immune to Electric. Nidoqueen in particular is really nice, as it can provide power and Stealth Rock support.</p>"

  "Vaporeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Though Vaporeon has a good HP stat and useful ability in Water Absorb, it is largely outclassed in the UU metagame. Specifically, Alomomola, with much greater physical bulk and access to an amazing ability in Regenerator, almost completely invalidates any niche Vaporeon has. Milotic also acts as a more effective bulky pure Water-types, as it's much more self-sustainable due to Recover, has much higher physical bulk, and can comfortably run Haze to deter setup sweepers without giving up too much. Wish passing and cleric duties can also be done better by Sylveon, Florges, Umbreon, and Blissey, all of which have better bulk or typing to do their jobs. Consider using one of these Pokemon instead of Vaporeon when making a UU team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A spread of 252 HP / 172 Def / 84 SpD with a Bold nature can be used to give Vaporeon slightly more rounded bulk. Haze can be used as another way to deal with bulky boosting Pokemon such as CurseLax and Calm Mind Reuniclus, as Roar's negative priority gives them a chance to attack Vaporeon, but Roar is usually better because it can mess with their switch-ins and deal with other boosting Pokemon as well. An offensive set with Signal Beam could be funny to lure Celebi.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Most other Water-types stall Vaporeon out. Suicune can PP stall Vaporeon thanks to Rest and Pressure, Slowking can set up all over Vaporeon with Calm Mind, Jellicent can Taunt Vaporeon and completely shut it down, and Alomomola and Milotic commonly run Toxic which can outlast Vaporeon's Heal Bell PP.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Attackers</strong>: Vaporeon lacks the physical bulk to deal with physical threats such as Choice Band Krookodile, Choice Band Entei, and Mega Swampert.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Many Pokemon can use non-Roar Vaporeon variants as setup bait and proceed from there to sweep your team. Toxicroak can set up on it easily thanks to its Water immunity, and Calm Mind users take Vaporeon's attacks very well and can deal huge damage back to it after boosts. Even when fully invested, Vaporeon doesn't have the physical bulk to stand up to physical sweepers such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Swords Dance Cobalion, and Dragon Dance Haxorus.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Celebi switches in for free on Vaporeon and can set up easily on it. Roserade can also switch in easily and proceed to set up Spikes or cripple a switchin with Sleep Powder while forcing Vaporeon out. Whimsicott can use Encore to shut Vaporeon down, though it's rather hampered by Scald burns. Mega Abomasnow and Shaymin can also switch in and proceed to fire off powerful attacks against Vaporeon's team.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-C, Heliolisk, and Mega Ampharos can come in on Vaporeon and threaten it with their powerful STAB moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald has a high burn chance and does decent damage due to Vaporeon's high Special Attack stat. It is a spammable move, and burning foes can help at whatever point of the game you may be in. Wish provides Vaporeon and its teammates with recovery and can allow it to give free switches to teammates and heal them if they are weakened. Protect allows Vaporeon to scout for moves, recover from Leftovers, get crash damage on Mienshao, and get a Wish off. In addition, it also allows you to scout Choice-locked Pokemon and switch in to the appropriate teammate after seeing their move. Heal Bell gets rid of all status effects that your team might have been inflicted with, while Roar phazes foes and prevents Vaporeon from being setup bait. Ice Beam hits Pokemon such as Chesnaught, Hydreigon, and Haxorus, which resist Vaporeon's STAB moves, with Haxorus being able to set up on it. Toxic can to be used to cripple switch-ins or stall alongside Wish and Protect.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Vaporeon's overall bulk. A Bold nature lets it take on the likes of Darmanitan, Mienshao, Krookodile, and other physical attackers better, while Calm can be used to help stand up to Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Hydreigon, Nidoking, and Mega Blastoise. Leftovers is used for extra recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vaporeon is extremely reliant on Wish to keep it healthy against the many physical foes that it's supposed to check. Vaporeon can be sent in on a wall or weak Pokemon so it can recover its health or help teammates heal up. When it is facing an offensive Pokemon at a good amount of health, Scald should be used because of its high burn chance and decent damage output. Heal Bell should be used to help Vaporeon's teammates when they are crippled with status, though if you have a Guts user with a status condition, you may have to make a choice between weakening it or healing teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vaporeon works well on balanced teams that appreciate Wish and cleric support. Vaporeon's weaknesses are covered in a Fire / Water / Grass core with Pokemon such as Entei, Infernape, Darmanitan, Chandelure, Roserade, Shaymin, and Whimsicott. Vaporeon can pair well with Stealth Rock setters; for example, Vaporeon works well with Mega Aggron and Forretress, as it covers their Fire weaknesses and provides Wish support, which they appreciate, as they do not have reliable recovery. In addition, they can take Grass-type moves for Vaporeon. Dragalge appreciates Wish support from Vaporeon, as entry hazards can wear it down, and it resists Electric- and Grass-type moves, which are super effective on Vaporeon. Hydreigon and Mega Ampharos are alternative Dragon-types that also have good type synergy with Vaporeon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>A pure glass cannon, Jolteon's frailty holds it back from dominating the tier. Its amazing Speed stat, however, gives it a saving grace. It also has decent Special Attack, allowing it to function well as a special attacker within the tier. Unfortunately for Jolteon, Heliolisk gives it very stiff competition. Jolteon lacks the coverage moves Heliolisk thrives on as well as the Water-type immunity Heliolisk gains via Dry Skin, which Jolteon barely makes up for with its Electric-type immunity from Volt Absorb.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jolteon could potentially run a decent Substitute + Petaya Berry set, but it is usually better off just going with the standard set holding a Life Orb. Jolteon has access to a plethora of support moves ranging from Wish to Thunder Wave, but despite this, it is unable to successfully utilize a successful support set, as it's far too frail. Jolteon could also hold a Choice Scarf to make it the fastest user of the item in the tier, but then it loses out on the power boost from Life Orb or Choice Specs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types can only be taken out depending on which Hidden Power Jolteon decides to use, and if Jolteon doesn't OHKO the Ground-type with said Hidden Power, Jolteon is OHKOed in return by a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Blissey and Florges easily take anything Jolteon can throw at them and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Pokemon that commonly hold a Choice Scarf, such as Mienshao and Hydreigon, easily outspeed Jolteon and OHKO with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves, such as Extreme Speed and Sucker Punch, easily KO Jolteon due to its low Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types—Shaymin and Celebi to name a few—resist Jolteon's STAB moves and can usually take at least one Signal Beam or Hidden Power Ice and retaliate with a powerful Grass-type STAB move.</p>",

Thunderbolt is used for a stronger STAB move that hits harder than Volt Switch and allows Jolteon to serve as a better Suicune check. Hidden Power Ice gives Jolteon near-perfect neutral coverage. Hidden Power Grass, on the other hand, allows Jolteon to hit Swampert, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior hard due to their quadruple weakness to Grass-type attacks. Shadow Ball gives Jolteon neutral coverage against Rotom-H as well as super effective coverage against Chandelure and Reuniclus, among others. Meanwhile, Signal Beam allows Jolteon to hit Dark-types for super effective damage as well as Grass-types, especially Celebi, harder than Hidden Power Ice does.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs maximizes Jolteon's Special Attack, making it a deadly late-game sweeper. A Life Orb doesn't give as big of a boost as Choice Specs does but allows Jolteon to switch up moves.

A Timid nature is used to make full use of Jolteon's amazing Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jolteon is best used as a late-game sweeper and revenge killer. It should be sent in against frail Pokemon that it outspeeds, such as Mienshao and Cloyster, and either KO them or gain momentum with Volt Switch. Jolteon should also try to prevent Volt Switch users from gaining momentum by switching into a predicted Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is imperative to an effective Jolteon sweep, making entry hazard setters such as Nidoqueen and Roserade good partners. VoltTurn partners are highly appreciated for their ability to form VoltTurn cores with Jolteon; examples include Hydreigon and Cobalion, among others. Forretress gets a special mention for its ability to do both roles previously mentioned as good Jolteon partners. Sweepers and wallbreakers make amazing partners to each other. In light of this, wallbreakers such as Choice Band Darmanitan and Choice Specs Kyurem make great Jolteon teammates. Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise, make for good teammates as well, as they are able to take on a majority of the Ground-types that Jolteon struggles with.</p>"

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite the many Water-types in the tier, Omastar finds its place thanks to its access to Shell Smash, its impressive Special Attack, and an offensive movepool that gives it all it needs to function as a terrifying sweeper. However, while Omastar hits significantly harder, it faces competition from Cloyster, which boasts a better Speed tier. Moreover, Omastar's pitiful Special Defense and Speed leave it very reliant on its Focus Sash to set up safely. Even after a boost, it fails to outspeed common Choice Scarf users that litter the tier, such as Darmanitan, Hydreigon, and Mienshao, although Weak Armor can rectify that if Omastar is setting up on physical attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Omastar can be run as a Swift Swim sweeper on rain teams, but it faces heavy competition from Kingdra, which has superior Speed and the capacity to run a mixed set. Mental Herb is an option, as it allows Omastar to negate the effects of Taunt and Encore, which inhibit it from setting up. Omastar could run a suicide lead or physically defensive set with its access to Spikes and Stealth Rock, but both sets lose to common entry hazard removers, and the latter offers little to no defensive advantages that make it worth using over other Water-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users that possess base 90 Speed and above such as Hydreigon and Mienshao outrun even a Shell Smash-boosted Omastar and weaken or outright OHKO it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users such as Mega Absol and Feraligatr can easily pick off a weakened Omastar after its drop in defenses from Shell Smash, but a healthy Omastar can shrug off most physical priority attacks. Special priority users such as Lucario and Infernape can easily revenge kill Omastar with Vacuum Wave.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Blissey, Florges, and Umbreon can tank a +2 Hydro Pump from Omastar. Blissey can chip away at it with Seismic Toss and cripple it with status, Florges can wear it down with Moonblast, and Umbreon can heavily dent Omastar with Foul Play after it has boosted.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Omastar's low Special Defense, it has to be wary when facing off against special attackers such as Hydreigon and Shaymin, which can all severely weaken it with their STAB attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash doubles Omastar's Special Attack and Speed, making it an offensive behemoth. Hydro Pump is its most powerful STAB attack and hits incredibly hard after a boost. Ice Beam allows Omastar to hit Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Hydro Pump, such as Shaymin and Hydreigon. Hidden Power Electric hits Water-types that would otherwise wall Omastar, such as Suicune and Gyarados, for heavy damage. Scald or Surf is an option over Hydro Pump if you prefer superior accuracy; however, Omastar sorely misses the power, as it fails to OHKO the likes of Reuniclus, Sableye, and Mega Aggron and 2HKO Snorlax and Porygon2. Alternatively, Earth Power hits Toxicroak, Empoleon, and Tentacruel for substantial damage, but it is rather suboptimal because Omastar loses the ability to break past most Water-types if it doesn't run Hidden Power Electric.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Omastar to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature is necessary to outrun key threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sceptile after a boost. Focus Sash guarantees that Omastar can set up safely against teams that lack means of rendering it helpless, such as Whimsicott and Sableye, which can use Encore or Taunt against it. Life Orb is an alternative option to amplify Omastar's sweeping potential, which sometimes makes it a better choice over Focus Sash. Weak Armor is the ability of choice, as it allows Omastar to potentially gain an extra Speed boost, which allows it to outrun all relevant Choice Scarf users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Omastar should be preserved until late-game, when all its checks and counters have been weakened or eliminated, especially Choice Scarf users, as most can outrun it even after a Shell Smash boost. Omastar should not be switched in with entry hazards on the field in order to preserve its Focus Sash. Life Orb variants should seek to set up on attackers that struggle to break through its impressive Defense. Omastar should aim to be brought in through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn or after a teammate has fainted, to avoid taking unnecessary damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is a necessity to keep Omastar's Focus Sash intact, so Pokemon that can remove entry hazards are good partners. Fast suicide leads such as Aerodactyl make for fine partners, as they both set and prevent entry hazards. Forretress and Gligar are nice partners as well, as Omastar appreciates their slow Volt Switch and U-turn, as well as their ability to set up entry hazards. Mega Blastoise shares similar checks to Omastar and assists in weakening its checks. Entry hazard support is appreciated to help secure KOs, so good teammates include Nidoqueen and Cobalion, which set up Stealth Rock, and Roserade and Accelgor, which set up Spikes. Memento users such as Gardevoir, Whimsicott, and Chandelure are good partners, especially for the Life Orb set, as they somewhat offset Omastar's average bulk and permit safer setup opportunities. Finally, Fire- and Flying-types such as Entei, Infernape, and Mega Aerodactyl make for good partners, as they all break down Grass-types that can threaten Omastar with their STAB attacks.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is arguably the best Mega Evolution in UU, as it is easy to fit onto most teams due to its high customizability and expansive movepool, decent bulk when invested, and ability to set up, which can surprise the opponent. Specifically, Hone Claws can let it become a very potent wallbreaker coupled with the fact that its Flying-type STAB moves and some coverage moves are boosted by Tough Claws. Aerodactyl is also the fastest lead in UU, meaning it can shut down other leads through Taunt fairly easily, giving the team entry hazards without the foe setting up their own. Its amazing Speed tier before Mega Evolving becomes even better after Mega Evolving, outspeeding the entire unboosted tier as well as base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure and below. Mega Aerodactyl is great at revenge killing as well, as its Speed and power make it an extremely reliable blanket check to most offensive threats such as Mega Beedrill, Shaymin, and Entei. While Aerodactyl has a lot of good things going for it, it struggles with bulky Water- and Steel-types such as Suicune, Mega Blastoise, Swampert, Forretress, Mega Aggron, and Doublade. It also has very common weaknesses in Water, Ice, and Rock, limiting the number of times it can switch in, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and Water- and Ice-type attacks litter the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Head or Iron Tail not only gain the Tough Claws boost but also can replace Earthquake to hit Rock-types and gain coverage against Florges; however, the loss of coverage for Steel-types leaves Mega Aerodactyl completely walled by them. Ice Fang, Thunder Fang, and Fire Fang, thanks to the Tough Claws boost, all become viable options, with Ice Fang hitting bulky Ground-types while also gaining coverage on Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Thunder Fang giving Aerodactyl a way to cripple Water-types such as Feraligatr and Suicune, and Fire Fang covering Forretress, which is neutral to Earthquake, and Bronzong, which is immune to Earthquake thanks to Levitate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune, Swampert, and Mega Blastoise can all take Aerodactyl's attacks, even when it's at +1, and fire back with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Mienshao outspeed Mega Aerodactyl and can cripple or OHKO it after a bit of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Doublade, Mega Aggron, and Bronzong all resist both of Aerodactyl's STAB types and take little damage from its coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Being easily pressured by powerful attacks with a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, Mega Aerodactyl has a hard time switching in multiple times with or without Roost.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Cresselia and Porygon2 can tank Aerodactyl's STAB moves, heal off the damage with Moonlight or Recover, respectively, and cripple Aerodactyl with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority Moves</strong>: Mamoswine and Feraligatr both can KO a weakened Mega Aerodactyl with their STAB Ice Shard and Aqua Jet before it can move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is a STAB move that allows Aerodactyl to hit opposing Flying-types as well as Ice-, Fire-, and Bug-types such as Kyurem, Entei, Darmanitan, and Mega Beedrill. Wing Attack, while seemingly weak, gets the Tough Claws boost, making it very potent against Fighting-types, as well as Grass-types that can tank Stone Edge such as Shaymin and Chesnaught. Earthquake is used for its ability to hit Steel-types such as Cobalion, Lucario, and Doublade, which resist both of Aerodactyl's STAB types. Aqua Tail not only benefits from Tough Claws but also gives Aerodactyl a way around Ground-types such as Mamoswine, Krookodile, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen (although the latter two are covered by Earthquake). Roost allows Mega Aerodactyl to keep its health high, letting it keep threatening the opposing team, while Stealth Rock gives Mega Aerodactyl a way to support the team if the move can't be fit onto the team somewhere else. Pursuit is an option to trap physically frail Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill and Chandelure. Taunt could work in tandem with Roost, allowing Aerodactyl to avoid status moves and block recovery while continually wearing down the opposing team with its high-powered STAB moves. It also stops Defog, which works well for entry hazard-stacking teams. Defog is an option to allow Aerodactyl to get rid of entry hazards; however, it is incompatible with Unnerve. Fire Fang is an option to OHKO Forretress, which would otherwise tank Aerodactyl's moves and OHKO it with Gyro Ball. Crunch gives Aerodactyl an option to hit Doublade harder than Earthquake thanks to the Tough Claws boost, as well as Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Reuniclus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Aerodactylite allows Aerodactyl to Mega Evolve. A Jolly nature is used to outpace Timid Mega Sceptile and Jolly Mega Beedrill as well as +1 Gyarados, +1 Feraligatr, and certain Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir and Chandelure; however, an Adamant nature can be used, as it still makes Mega Aerodactyl faster than all neutral-natured Pokemon such as Adamant Mega Beedrill and Modest Mega Sceptile. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Aerodactyl to hit as hard and as fast as possible. However, Aerodactyl can invest into its bulk by hitting certain benchmarks in Speed. Running 104 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allows Mega Aerodactyl to outspeed Tornadus before Mega Evolving and Crobat after. Aerodactyl can also run 216 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature to outspeed Mega Sceptile and Mega Beedrill as well as Choice Scarf Chandelure and Gardevoir.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is meant to be used as a fast support Pokemon that can also reliably wear down the opponent's team via its STAB moves. Make sure to bring Mega Aerodactyl in safely on a resisted hit so that it can force the foe to take a hit. Use the switches that Mega Aerodactyl forces to set up Stealth Rock or Roost off damage. If it is healthy, try to fire off an attack, as most threats that tend to switch into Mega Aerodactyl get worn down fast such as Swampert and Forretress. Mega Aerodactyl's moves can be somewhat unpredictable at times, so it can lure certain foes very effectively; for instance, it can surprise Slowking with Crunch. Mega Aerodactyl also tends to run three attacks and Roost, so having four attacks can be really nice for luring too.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Toxicroak, Shaymin, or Heliolisk that take care of bulky Water-types can prevent them from forcing Mega Aerodactyl to switch out and take Stealth Rock damage and help Aerodactyl continue to apply pressure to the opposing team. Entry hazard removal support from the likes of Empoleon and Forretress helps clear away Stealth Rock, allowing Aerodactyl to have more opportunities to switch in without relying on staying healthy via Roost. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress and Swampert can help wear down Pokemon that switch into Aerodactyl, as most of Aerodactyl's checks and counters lack reliable recovery. Special wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Life Orb Hydreigon can destroy physical walls, allowing Aerodactyl to use its attacks more freely. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Lucario appreciate the support that Mega Aerodactyl can provide with its coverage, especially Pursuit, which can trap and KO Ghost-types that threaten these setup sweepers. Swords Dance Doublade is also a good teammate, as it can soften up a lot of foes for Mega Aerodactyl to spam its attacks.</p>"

      "Hone Claws": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hone Claws not only boosts Mega Aerodactyl's already sky-high Attack but also prevents its moves from missing. Stone Edge is Mega Aerodactyl's main STAB move and not only hits hard but also benefits from the accuracy boost given from Hone Claws. Wing Attack gets the Tough Claws boost, making it very strong against Fighting- and Grass-types that can tank Stone Edge, such as Shaymin and Chesnaught. Aqua Tail also benefits from Tough Claws, giving Aerodactyl a way around Ground-types that can tank Wing Attack such as Mamoswine, Krookodile, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen. Earthquake can be used to hit Steel-types such as Cobalion and Doublade. Roost gives Aerodactyl a reliable recovery move to continue boosting; however, by running it, Mega Aerodactyl loses out on important coverage. Fire Fang is an option to OHKO Forretress specifically, while Crunch gives Aerodactyl an option to hit Doublade harder than Earthquake thanks to the Tough Claws boost as well as Psychic-types such as Reuniclus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Mega Aerodactyl to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Jolly nature allows Aerodactyl to outspeed Jolly Mega Beedrill and Timid Mega Sceptile after Mega Evolving as well as certain Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure. Adamant is also viable, as it maximizes Mega Aerodactyl's wallbreaking potential. Aerodactylite allows Aerodactyl to Mega Evolve in the first place. A good alternative EV spread is 232 Atk / 40 Def / 236 Spe with an Adamant nature, which allows Mega Aerodactyl to outspeed maximum Speed Crobat and lets it survive Jolly Mamoswine's Ice Shard after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best to save Mega Aerodactyl for the mid- or late-game, as this set aims to set up and sweep rather than fire off powerful attacks. Be wary of switching this particular set in, as the more damage Mega Aerodactyl accrues, the more easily it will be revenge killed when it aims to sweep. Based on coverage, make sure certain threats are gone, such as Ground-types such as Mamoswine if Mega Aerodactyl lacks Aqua Tail and Steel-types if Mega Aerodactyl lacks Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Heracross and Hoopa can wear down physical walls or get rid of them outright, giving Mega Aerodactyl an easier time sweeping. Volt Switch and U-turn users, such as Forretress, Heliolisk, and Whimsicott, can wear down the opposing team, allowing Aerodactyl to set up safely and sweep a weakened team. Whimsicott and Heliolisk also both beat bulky Water-types, which give Aerodactyl a hard time. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress and Swampert can help Aerodactyl secure some 2HKOs and OHKOs. Entry hazard removal from Forretress and Empoleon is key, as more often than not, Aerodactyl will be forgoing Roost to run coverage, meaning it can be worn down if Stealth Rock is up. A Pokemon like Toxicroak or Heliolisk that weakens bulky Water-types allows Aerodactyl to not be forced out once it sets up. Healing Wish or Lunar Dance users such as Shaymin and Cresselia can give Mega Aerodactyl a second chance at sweeping. Shaymin can also beat bulky Water-types for Aerodactyl, while Cresselia can provide Thunder Wave support.</p>"

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock gives Aerodactyl a way to break Sturdy and Focus Sashes while also providing the team with entry hazard support. The fastest Taunt in the tier allows Aerodactyl to prevent the other lead's entry hazards from being laid down. Double-Edge is the main attacking option to allow Aerodactyl to KO itself before the foe can use Defog or Rapid Spin. Fire Blast lets Aerodactyl to get around Forretress, which may try to spin away its Stealth Rock. If that isn't needed, Stone Edge is a really good STAB move, though it is a bit unreliable. Tailwind can also provide the team with the upper hand, allowing Aerodactyl to help support its team even further.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash ensures that Aerodactyl can survive any hit and be able to set up Stealth Rock. 72 Special Attack EVs allow Aerodactyl to OHKO Forretress with Fire Blast, while maximum Speed EVs make Aerodactyl as fast as possible. The rest are placed into Attack to make Double-Edge hit as hard as possible. A Hasty nature is essential to not weaken Fire Blast's power; however, a Jolly nature can be used if Fire Blast is not being used. If so, the Special Attack EVs can be moved into Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aerodactyl should always lead, as it wins against most other leads such as Forretress thanks to its access to Taunt. Watch out for Froslass or Sableye leads, as Froslass has a super effective STAB move to hit Aerodactyl with, while Sableye has priority Taunt to prevent Aerodactyl from using Taunt itself or laying down Stealth Rock. Aerodactyl should only be used on hyper offensive teams because it is a suicide lead, meaning the team wants to apply as much offensive pressure as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ghost-types such as Hoopa and Sableye not only appreciate Aerodactyl's entry hazard support, but also keep Stealth Rock up by blocking Rapid Spin. Sableye also has access to Prankster Taunt, meaning it can reliably make sure no Defogger can get rid of Stealth Rock as well. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Heliolisk and Mega Beedrill appreciate being able to wear down the opposing team with Stealth Rock coupled with their powerful attacks. They can also wear down the opponent's Defogger or spinner, allowing Stealth Rock to stay on the field. The team should be offensively oriented to keep up the offensive pressure, so Pokemon like Hydreigon, Infernape, and Mienshao are good options, as they all provide power and appreciate the Stealth Rock support this set provides.</p>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Snorlax is one of the premier special walls in UnderUsed thanks to its gargantuan base 160 HP and desirable base 110 Special Defense, but it faces stiff competition from Florges and Umbreon. Its base 110 Attack stat is nothing to scoff at either, as Snorlax is renowned for 2HKOing, at minimum, a lot of bulky threats. Thick Fat is a godsend of an ability for Snorlax, as it grants two free resistances to Fire- and Ice-type attacks. Snorlax is one of a few Pokemon with access to Curse in UnderUsed, giving it a niche as one of the best mid- to late-game wincons while patching up its shoddy Defense, which prevents generally powerful threats like Mamoswine from 2HKOing Snorlax. However, Snorlax's low Defense, terrible Speed, and lackluster typing prevent it from reliably being a top-tier threat; Snorlax is still usually OHKOed or 2HKOed by most Fighting-type attacks, even after a Curse boost, and every viable Taunt user is capable of outspeeding it and preventing it from Resting away crippling status and damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest set with four attacks is an alluring option thanks to Snorlax's sky-high special bulk and Attack stat, but this prevents it from resting off burns and damage, thus severely limiting its usefulness in a match. Such a Snorlax would be forced into running Facade, similarly to the Choice Band set, or be left helpless against burns. Custap Berry with Gluttony is a neat combination that lets Snorlax move first once it falls to 50% HP, potentially allowing it to get off a last-minute Self-Destruct, punch a hole through the opposition, and give a teammate room to begin a sweep. It is recommended that such a Snorlax run Double-Edge instead of Return, as the recoil damage will help Snorlax sooner reach Custap range.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: Because Snorlax is reliant on Facade and Rest to bypass Will-O-Wisp and stray Scald burns, Sableye is a complete stop to Snorlax, as it is immune to Facade, can Taunt and re-burn Curse sets before they can prove effective, and can immediately threaten Snorlax with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Physical Fighting-types, such as Mienshao, Infernape, Heracross, and Conkeldurr, immediately nullify Snorlax with their strong STAB moves. However, the frailer of these pokemon must be wary of offensive Snorlax variants as they will either OHKO or do significant damage with Return. Cobalion gets a special mention here, as Snorlax will fail to OHKO it with Earthquake and will in turn be OHKOed by Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Doublade</strong>: Doublade is a perfect stop to the Curse set, as Sacred Sword ignores the Defense boosts from Curse and will cleanly 3HKO Snorlax. However, if Snorlax is running Earthquake, Doublade will need to be cautious. Doublade outspeeds and can beat Choice Band Snorlax one-on-one unless it erroneously switches in on an Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Krookodile, Mamoswine, and other Choice Band wallbreakers such as Metagross, all severely impact Snorlax's longevity. Many of these Pokemon further threaten Snorlax because of their access to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Roar users such as Swampert and Empoleon, as well as Haze Milotic and Tentacruel, will prevent CurseLax from setting up while also potentially racking up entry hazard damage due to their access to Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Crobat prevent CurseLax from setting up and using Rest, limiting its staying power.</p> <p><strong>Trick / Switcheroo</strong>: Trick and Switcheroo users such as Chandelure and Whimsicott cripple CurseLax while severely hindering the offensive sets. Whimsicott can also Encore Curse Snorlax into a single move for several turns, potentially locking it into a non-damaging move or preventing it from using Rest.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "CurseLax": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse allows Snorlax to set up for a sweep, increasing its Attack and Defense by a stage at the cost of lowering its dismal Speed by a stage. Return is Snorlax's primary STAB move and can 2HKO bulkier offensive threats, such as Mega Blastoise, after one Curse boost. Body Slam is a secondary option that can sometimes paralyze common switch-ins to Snorlax, which can be pivotal in a late-game scenario, enabling Snorlax to sweep the opposing team. However, since it misses out on important 2HKOs against moderately bulkier Pokemon, such as Crobat, Mega Blastoise, and Nidoqueen, Return is the favorable option. Similarly, in the scenario Snorlax is faced off against an opposing wincon like Calm Mind Suicune, Body Slam will need five Curse boosts to ensure that Suicune is 2HKOed, whereas Return is capable of 2HKOing it after four Curse boosts. The choice is a matter of power versus potential, with Return being the generally favored option. Rest provides Snorlax with reliable recovery and allows it to restore its health and cure any status conditions after setting up a Curse or two. Sleep Talk allows Snorlax to remove some disadvantage of the two-turn sleep by potentially setting up more Curses or using Return, though it might also waste a turn by calling Rest. Alternatively, Earthquake is ideal coverage for Steel- or Ghost-types that are unperturbed by a boosted Return or Body Slam, including Chandelure, Doublade, Mega Aggron, and Empoleon, and limits their ability to wall Snorlax. However, Snorlax cannot continuously set up on stronger special attackers like Nidoqueen and Hydreigon, as it will be forced to wait out the Rest turns instead of taking advantage of them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is used to balance out Snorlax's defensive stats, making it an excellent special tank that can also stomach a great deal of powerful physical attacks after a Curse boost or two. Leftovers allows Snorlax to continuously recover small amounts of HP throughout a match, greatly aiding its longevity. Thick Fat is used to weaken Fire- and Ice-type attacks by 50%, giving Snorlax two added resistances and making it all the harder for special attackers, like Kyurem and Chandelure, to break it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In order to gain maximum effectiveness, Snorlax absolutely needs opposing Sableye removed from play, as the Darkness Pokemon is a full stop to Snorlax. A very key thing to be aware of is that Snorlax cannot take on Fighting-types, such as Machamp and Mienshao, even at +1 Defense, so it is very important to work around and KO them so that Snorlax has the opportunity to set up. Snorlax should be used as a mid- and late-game wincon after its threats, specifically Sableye and opposing Fighting-types, and phazers have been eliminated. If you opt to run Body Slam, Snorlax can be used in the early stages of a match to fish for stray Body Slam paralyses, which will greatly assist its teammates. Snorlax beats almost all other boosting wincons, such as Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Calm Mind Florges, due to its marvelous Special Defense and the fact that Curse reduces damage from Psyshock, a common move seen on Calm Mind users. However, Calm Mind Reuniclus that run Focus Blast are still very capable of beating Snorlax after they manage to secure a couple of boosts. Calm Mind Suicune with Roar will also prove to be problematic during a mid- or late-game scenario, but Snorlax is still capable of winning if forced into a last Pokemon scenario.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to the prevalence of Fighting-types and Snorlax's inability to beat them without a substantial number of boosts, Pokemon such as Crobat and Cresselia make for excellent partners, as they can comfortably shrug off Fighting-type attacks aimed at Snorlax. Another option for managing Fighting-type opponents is Sableye, as its immunity to Fighting-type attacks and access to Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off help cripple some Fighting-types.  Be wary of Heracross, Conkeldurr, and Infernape however. Sableye also likes having Snorlax around to sponge powerful special attacks from threats, namely Hydreigon and Chandelure, and to deal with Fairy-types like Sylveon and Gardevoir. Because Sableye folds to Infernape, Jellicent and Slowking are also excellent partners for taking on opposing Fighting-types, both of which are also counters to Cobalion. If you opt for Sleep Talk over Earthquake, teammates capable of eliminating Steel- or Ghost-types, specifically Doublade, are of utmost value to Snorlax. Fire-types like Entei easily manage most Steel-types, while Krookodile and Hydreigon are excellent options for removing Ghost-types. Pursuit users, such as Mega Aerodactyl and the aforementioned Krookodile, also work in a pinch. Cleric support from Pokemon like Sylveon is also appreciated, as the combination of Wish and Aromatherapy helps prevent Snorlax from having to prematurely rely on Rest to stay healthy. Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon like Roserade, Forretress, or Tentacruel is also beneficial to put pressure on Snorlax's counters.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a powerful and reliable STAB option, OHKOing all frail threats that don't resist it and 2HKOing most other bulky threats, such as Mega Blastoise or maximum Defense Slowking. Facade allows Snorlax to take advantage of stray burns from Will-O-Wisp or Scald and also takes advantage of opposing Toxic and/or Toxic Spikes, convincingly outdamaging Return. However, if Snorlax isn't statused, Facade will be significantly weaker than Return. Earthquake gives Snorlax the ability to hit opposing Steel- or Rock-types, such as Doublade, non-Shuca Berry Cobalion, and Tyrantrum, that may switch in on a predicted Normal-type attack while hitting most Ghost-types, such as Chandelure and Sableye, hard on the switch in. Fire Punch rounds out Snorlax's coverage and allows it to KO specific Steel-type threats, 2HKOing Forretress and Bronzong and OHKOing Escavalier, while being Snorlax's best attacking option against threats like Mega Abomasnow and Froslass. However, Pursuit gives Snorlax the ability to trap frail Psychic- and Ghost-types incapable of beating it one-on-one, such as Chandelure, preventing them from freely switching out while doing massive damage to such frail targets. Focus Punch is a useful option in the fourth slot to OHKO Cobalion as it switches in on an expected Normal-type move, as it's a common Snorlax switch-in on many balance teams and Earthquake fails to OHKO Shuca Berry variants.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band is used to capitalize on Snorlax's impressive Attack stat and turn it into a powerful, hard to switch-in on threat. The set EVs are used to maximize Snorlax's Attack and Special Defense, allowing it to obliterate the opposition and switch in on most unboosted special attacks with impunity. If Snorlax opts to run Fire Punch over Pursuit, an investment of 8 Speed EVs is mandatory in order to ensure that it outspeeds 84 Speed Escavalier, thus allowing Snorlax to OHKO Escavalier before taking damage. Thick Fat further boosts Snorlax's ability to sponge attacks by reducing the damage done by Fire- and Ice-type attacks by 50%, allowing it to soft check offensive threats like Rotom-H and Kyurem. Snorlax won't appreciate Trick from Rotom-H, however.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Snorlax is best used as a wallbreaker and is an excellent tool for dismantling balance teams that rely on offensive Steel-types—specifically Cobalion or Doublade—to check powerful Normal-type attackers thanks to Snorlax's ability to sponge any non-super effective hit and deliver a devastating attack in return. Choice Band Snorlax's ability to remove a key threat in Chandelure is a massive selling point for this set; if the opportunity presents itself, one should take it. However, if Snorlax's checks and counters are still on the field, some prediction is still required, as its STAB moves are less effective when bulky Steel-, Rock-, or Ghost-types are still around. If the opposing team lacks Ghost- or Steel-type switch-ins to Snorlax, it is recommended that Snorlax try to catch a Scald burn from threats like Slowking and Suicune, as it ramps up the power of Facade and makes Snorlax a nightmare to switch in on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Snorlax is more of a supporting wallbreaker for weaker sweepers, offensive partners that can capitalize on Snorlax's weakness to Fighting-types make for excellent partners. Gyarados, Toxicroak, and Trick Room Reuniclus are Pokemon that can comfortably stomach Fighting-type attacks and appreciate having bulky threats removed or severely weakened by Snorlax, to enable a sweep. Trick Room Reuniclus has the added benefit of utilizing Snorlax's poor speed to its advantage in certain situations. Snorlax's ability to efficiently eliminate opposing Chandelure makes Infernape an excellent offensive teammate, as it greatly appreciates having the extra space to freely spam STAB Fire- and Fighting-type attacks. Snorlax is pretty adept at handling most Water-type Pokemon too, which Infernape typically prefers not to deal with. Bullet Punch Lucario falls into this category as well, as Snorlax is capable of dealing a sufficient amount of damage to Sableye, which gives Lucario the opportunity to pick it off and begin a sweep. Life Orb Nidoqueen forms a great wallbreaking tandem with Snorlax, as it comfortably beats down most physical walls while Snorlax picks on the special walls and tanks common attacks aimed at Nidoqueen. Nidoqueen also has the added benefit of being able to provide entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and/or Toxic Spikes, helping turn many of Snorlax's 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Forretress makes for a solid teammate, as it is capable of clearing enemy hazards that would limit Snorlax's staying power. Forretress's slow Volt Switch also provides opportunities for Snorlax to come in safely and dish out massive damage. The lack of Rest or residual Leftovers recovery will see Snorlax worn down by chip damage from weaker opponents, status, and entry hazards, so Wish and Aromatherapy support from Florges is greatly appreciated.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Moltres is a fearsome bird with high offensive prowess. Its high-powered STAB moves are backed by a great base 125 Special Attack. It has enough Speed to outpace most defensive Pokemon, while its bulk and typing give it the opportunity to take a few hits. This typing also gives it a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, though, meaning Moltres needs much more support than most offensive threats. However, this support can pay off; Moltres is one of the hardest Pokemon to switch into. Access to Roost also means that even Stealth Rock cannot completely neutralize Moltres.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf and Choice Specs may seem appealing to use on Moltres. However, these items lock Moltres in to one move, giving up its good coverage and making it setup fodder. Ancient Power can be used to hit Mega Aerodactyl and Rotom-H super effectively. Moltres can also make use of Pressure on a Substitute + Toxic set, but it gives up its offensive presence in doing so.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Moltres loses half of its health every time it switches into Stealth Rock. Keeping Stealth Rock up can severely limit Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Mega Aerodactyl</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl resists both of Moltres's STAB moves and takes neutral damage from Hidden Power Grass. It can force Moltres out with the threat of Stone Edge and can Roost off any damage it takes.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Snorlax, Goodra, Blissey, and Porygon2 can switch into all of Moltres's attacks and cripple it with Thunder Wave, Toxic, or super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Most Electric-types, including Mega Ampharos, Rotom-H, and Heliolisk, either resist both of Moltres's STAB moves or are able to outspeed and OHKO it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast and Hurricane are both high-Base Power STAB moves. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast for 100% accuracy, but the drop in power is very apparent. The two STAB moves have very good coverage together, with Hurricane hitting the bulky Water-types that resist Fire Blast. Hidden Power Grass hits Rock-types that resist Moltres's STAB moves, such as Rhyperior, as well as letting Moltres hit Swampert without having to rely on Hurricane's 70% accuracy. Will-O-Wisp can be used as an alternative to cripple common checks to Moltres, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Tyrantrum, and Snorlax. Roost allows Moltres to heal off any damage it has taken and allows Moltres to switch in more than once if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs are used; although Moltres has decent bulk, no amount of investment will help it take non-resisted hits very well. It sits at an important Speed tier where it is prudent to fully invest in Speed. Timid is preferred to outspeed Mamoswine, Heracross, and Chandelure, whereas Modest gives it more power. Life Orb is used to maximize damage while allowing Moltres to switch moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Moltres should be able to come in on weak or resisted moves. However, be wary of common coverage moves that hit Moltres super effectively, such as Stone Edge and Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>With a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, Moltres requires the support of a Rapid Spin or Defog user such as Mega Blastoise or Empoleon. Late-game sweepers such as Sharpedo appreciate Moltres's wallbreaking. Moltres needs a teammate that can absorb Stone Edges and Rock Slides, such as Swampert. Strong Fighting-types such as Heracross and Conkeldurr can remove Blissey, Porygon2, and Snorlax. These Fighting-types appreciate Moltres's ability to handle Fairy-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Pokemon that can set up Spikes also make for great teammates, as several of Moltres's counters, such as Snorlax, Porygon2, and Mega Ampharos, are vulnerable to them. Chesnaught and Roserade in particular are well-suited for this role, as they can set up on the Water-types that trouble Moltres. Chesnaught also offers a Rock-type resistance and can easily set up on or check other Pokemon that trouble Moltres, such as Blissey, Snorlax, Mega Sharpedo, Krookodile, and Tyrantrum.</p>"

  "Feraligatr": {
    "overview": "<p>With a naturally high base Attack and a great ability in Sheer Force, Feraligatr is a premier offensive threat in UU. Feraligatr's access to a variety of great boosting moves as well as a priority move allow it to perform the role of a powerful wallbreaker or a sweeper, and its good typing and bulk provide it with plenty of opportunities to set up. However, Feraligatr's low Speed can make it fall flat against offensive teams, as it is outsped even at +1 by common Pokemon. In addition, it doesn't have many coverage options to speak of, and its attacks are relatively low-powered. Finally, it faces heavy competition from Gyarados, whose typing, Speed, and access to Intimidate often make it a more reliable sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Feraligatr can use Agility to clean up faster teams after some prior damage. It can also use a special attacking set with moves such as Scald, Ice Beam, and Focus Blast to surprise physical walls, which it often lures in, but Swords Dance variants do huge damage to these Pokemon at +2 Attack anyway. Finally, Feraligatr can use Earthquake and Low Kick to do more damage to certain foes, such as Mega Aggron and Empoleon, but these moves are generally not worth a moveslot and neither is boosted by Sheer Force.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Bulky Water-types check the Dragon Dance set and threaten to burn it with Scald; however, they will be severely weakened or KOed if Feraligatr carries Substitute. Mega Aggron and Empoleon can take most of Feraligatr's attacks and phaze it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Faster Grass-types such as Shaymin and Celebi can directly force out Swords Dance Feraligatr. Whimsicott can lock Feraligatr into a setup move with Encore or threaten it with Giga Drain. Mega Sceptile outspeeds +1 Feraligatr, resists Aqua Jet, and can KO with Giga Drain. Chesnaught can take any attack and wear Feraligatr down with Leech Seed or KO it with Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Offensive Rotom formes outspeed Feraligatr, though Rotom-H must be wary of boosted Aqua Jet. Heliolisk is immune to Aqua Jet and its Hyper Voice goes through Feraligatr's potential Substitute, though it can't switch into Ice Punch or Crunch. Defensive Mega Ampharos can take anything - save for a +2 Adamant Ice Punch - and KO Feraligatr with Volt Switch after Stealth Rock damage; offensive variants of Mega Ampharos can take any unboosted attack.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance turns Feraligatr into a sweeper by boosting its Attack and Speed by one stage each. Boosted by STAB, Sheer Force, and Life Orb, Waterfall is Feraligatr's most powerful move. Crunch is a useful coverage move that hits Psychic-types such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, and Celebi super effectively and provides Feraligatr with neutral coverage on opposing Water-types. Ice Punch is a useful coverage move that hits the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Waterfall. Substitute can be used to set up on defensive Water-types that rely on Scald, as none of them can break Feraligatr's Substitute in one hit. Swords Dance can also be used in the final moveslot to give Feraligatr another option to boost against bulkier teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs allow Feraligatr to outspeed Pokemon up to Timid Noivern after one Dragon Dance and Choice Scarf Mienshao after two Dragon Dances. An Adamant nature is preferred for more power, but a Jolly nature is usable to outspeed Adamant Heracross, Adamant Lucario, and, after a Dragon Dance, Crobat. If using Substitute, 36 EVs should be moved from Attack to Special Defense in order to ensure that defensive Suicune's +1 Scald will never break Feraligatr's Substitute. The combination of Sheer Force and Life Orb negates Life Orb recoil and grants a 1.69x boost to Waterfall, Crunch, and Ice Punch at the cost of their secondary effects.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Feraligatr works best on bulky and hyper offense teams as a late-game cleaner. Pokemon that outspeed Feraligatr after a boost include positive-natured Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Aerodactyl; all relevant Choice Scarf users; and Crobat and Noivern if Feraligatr runs an Adamant nature. Physical walls that can take Feraligatr's attacks when healthy, such as Mega Aggron and Chesnaught, should be weakened before attempting to set up. However, with Substitute, Feraligatr can set up on some physical walls, such as Suicune lacking Roar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Feraligatr appreciates the support of physical wallbreakers, such as Choice Band or Swords Dance Heracross, Choice Band Tyrantrum, and Swords Dance Haxorus. Spikes setters can help Feraligatr break through more Pokemon; Chesnaught and Roserade can set Spikes while also taking advantage of the Grass-, Electric-, and defensive Water-types that trouble Feraligatr. Dragalge also checks Pokemon of the aforementioned types and can provide Toxic Spikes support. Celebi and Whimsicott can check opposing Water-types and support Feraligatr with Healing Wish and Memento, respectively. Mega Sceptile can use its ability and typing to switch into the Electric- and Grass-type moves that threaten Feraligatr.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Feraligatr's already-high Attack stat, turning it into a powerful wallbreaker. Waterfall is Feraligatr's strongest STAB move and is benefited by Sheer Force and Life Orb. Crunch is Feraligatr's most powerful option to hit common Water-types and has super effective coverage on Psychic-types, such as Cresselia and Reuniclus. Substitute blocks attempts to status Feraligatr, particularly allowing it to set up easily on defensive Water-types without fearing a Scald burn, and provides some protection from revenge killing. Ice Punch can be used in the fourth moveslot as coverage against Grass-types, such as Chesnaught, and Dragon-types, such as Mega Ampharos. Aqua Jet gives Feraligatr useful and reliable priority, allowing it to KO frail or weakened offensive threats such as Mienshao and Mega Beedrill.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs are placed into Speed with a Jolly nature to allow Feraligatr to outspeed all relevant walls as well as certain offensive Pokemon, such as Adamant Heracross and Adamant Lucario. 36 EVs are placed into Special Defense to ensure that uninvested Suicune's +1 Scald will never break Feraligatr's Substitute; however, if a third attack is used over Substitute, these EVs should be placed into Attack instead. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack to maximize Feraligatr's damage output. The combination of Sheer Force and Life Orb gives Waterfall, Ice Punch, and Crunch a 1.69x boost and negates Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>Leftovers can be used to grant Feraligatr more longevity and to allow it to set up more Substitutes in the face of weak defensive Pokemon at the cost of considerable power. An alternate spread of 24 HP / 252 Atk / 32 SpD / 200 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used for more power and slightly more bulk while still outspeeding Adamant Honchkrow. Feraligatr can use Torrent over Sheer Force if it aims to sweep with Aqua Jet. In this case, Splash Plate is a good item choice to power up Feraligatr's Water-type moves without wearing it down, but Life Orb can help it get into Torrent range more quickly.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Feraligatr works best on bulky offense and balanced teams as a mid-game wallbreaker. It should be used to muscle through defensive Pokemon, making room for a teammate to clean up. Feraligatr can find plenty of opportunities to set up against Pokemon such as Suicune, Gligar, and Florges.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Feraligatr's teammates should take advantage of its ability to soften up physical walls. Choice Band Entei, Choice Scarf Infernape, and Mega Sharpedo all appreciate Feraligatr beating defensive Water-types and other physical walls. Fast Grass- and Electric-types such as Mega Sceptile and Heliolisk force Feraligatr out, so it needs teammates that can check them. Chesnaught and Roserade can check these Pokemon and also lay Spikes to support Feraligatr.</p>"

By virtue of its decent bulk, Speed, and Attack, Crobat is arguably the best check to Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon in UU, having enough bulk and a good typing to take any of their STAB moves and the Speed and Attack to strike back. It has a great movepool, including access to Defog, Taunt, U-turn, Roost, and STAB moves of choice, allowing it to function as an excellent team supporter. Thanks to its amazing Speed and decent Attack stats, it can be an effective user of Choice Band for decimating offensive teams. While decent enough to get by, base 90 Attack is nothing to write home about, so Crobat's Choice Band set often isn't powerful enough to take apart defensive builds. The same goes for Crobat's bulk; while it gets the job done, don't expect Crobat to be sponging attacks all day long.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set utilizing Choice Scarf can be used as a very specialized late-game cleaner, as it outpaces all relevant Choice Scarf users, allows Crobat to use an Adamant nature, and grants 80 extra EVs that can be placed in HP, a godsend for a late-game cleaner using recoil moves. Hypnosis can be used to put a foe to sleep but is hard to fit onto a set and isn't very reliable. A specially based set utilizing Nasty Plot to be a setup sweeper can be used, but it forgoes one of Crobat's main attractions in its ability to quickly fire off a powerful Brave Bird, and a special Crobat requires setup to deal significant damage. Whirlwind can be used on the support set to deal with setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage but is rather hard to fit onto a set over Crobat's other options. Super Fang is an option to strip 50% from the health of Bronzong, Empoleon, Mega Aggron, Mega Ampharos, and other physically bulky Pokemon which Crobat cannot otherwise harm. These Pokemon typically lack reliable recovery, potentially making the move very handy. Finally, Haze can be used to stop setup sweepers, but Defog, Taunt, U-turn, and Toxic are better options for Crobat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Heliolisk, Mega Ampharos, and Rotom-H resist Brave Bird and can OHKO Crobat with a STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Forretress, and Empoleon resist Brave Bird and can do whatever they like against Crobat, be it set up entry hazards, remove them, or attack.</p> <p><strong>Mega Aerodactyl</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Crobat and can take any of Crobat's attacks and then use Taunt to prevent Crobat from using Defog, set up Stealth Rock, use Defog itself, or KO Crobat with Stone Edge.</p>",

However, Acrobatics can be run without an item to take Knock Off better and by extension effectively counter Mega Beedrill. U-turn is valuable for the momentum it gains for the team, but can be omitted in favor of Toxic, which cripples walls and puts sweepers on a timer, or Taunt, which also cripples walls and can be used well in conjunction with Defog. Defog allows Crobat to clear entry hazards for your team. However, Taunt can be used on more offensive teams to keep foes from clearing away your own entry hazards with Defog and to cripple opposing walls. Finally, Roost is important in the last moveslot for reliable recovery and allowing Crobat to clear entry hazards and check Fighting- and Grass-types multiple times throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP EVs maximize Crobat's HP while rounding down damage taken from Stealth Rock. 212 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are enough to outspeed +1 Speed Adamant Feraligatr, a major threat. Crobat also outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame up to Timid Noivern.  The rest of the EVs are placed in Defense to check physical Fighting-types and Mega Beedrill better. Sky Plate can be used with 252 EVs in Attack to have more offensive presence and can be useful on more offensively based teams. If countering Mega Beedrill is a priority, then no item and Acrobatics can be used to take less damage from its Knock Off. Infiltrator is the ability of choice to hit Pokemon that are behind a Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Crobat set serves as a check to the Fighting- and Grass-types in UU and controls entry hazards in the process, be it through Taunt or Defog. If using a variant with Defog, try to bring Crobat in on a Fighting- or Grass-type and Defog on the switch or gain momentum with U-turn. If using Taunt, bringing Crobat in against the opponent's Defogger or entry hazard setter via U-turn, Volt Switch, or a double switch is the best way to keep the foe from doing its respective job. Finally, Crobat can stallbreak to an extent by crippling foes with Taunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Crobat fits well on balance, offense, and bulky offense teams that require entry hazard control or a check to Fighting- and Grass-types. Variants of Crobat carrying Taunt fit well on offensive teams, as they can keep your entry hazards on the field by using Taunt to prevent the foe from Defogging and can also be useful in keeping foes from setting entry hazards of their own. Crobat utilizing Defog works very well on balanced and bulky offense teams for its ability to clear away entry hazards multiple times throughout the course of the match. In terms of specific teammates, Swampert is notable for its good defensive synergy with Crobat, with Swampert taking on Rock- and Electric-types and Crobat beating Grass-types and Guts-using Fighting-types, such as Machamp.</p>"

U-turn is valuable for gaining momentum and wearing down Crobat's counters over the course of the match, especially when boosted by Choice Band. Cross Poison is a secondary STAB move that hits Electric- and Fairy-types slightly harder than Brave Bird does, and it has only a chance to OHKO Florges after Stealth Rock. Because of this, it can be omitted in favor of Defog for clearing entry hazards. Finally, the last moveslot is a toss-up between Defog, which can clear entry hazards for Crobat's team in a pinch, and Sleep Talk, which allows Crobat to absorb sleep-inducing moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Attack and Speed along with a Jolly nature maximizes Crobat's capabilities as a cleaner, revenge killer, and hard-hitter against offensive teams. Choice Band allows Crobat to punch major holes in offensive teams and deal heavy damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist its powerful Brave Bird. Infiltrator helps Crobat hurt users of Substitute such as Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune and Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set serves as a check to Fighting- and Grass-types because of its great defensive typing and STAB Brave Bird. It also does heavy damage to offensive teams thanks to its great Speed and strength with Choice Band equipped. It also takes care of common of Substitute-using setup sweepers, such as Cobalion and Chandelure.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swampert is a good partner for Crobat thanks to their great defensive synergy together and the fact that it can set up Stealth Rock for Crobat, making Crobat's job of punching holes in the opponent's team easier.

Furthermore, Togetic has a good variety of support moves, such as Defog and Wish, at its disposal.</p> <p>Togetic isn't without faults, however, as it is a very passive Pokemon whose highest attacking stat is its mediocre base 80 Special Attack. Togetic is also unable to utilize any of its abilities to full extent, as Hustle is unusable due Togetic's low Attack stat, Serene Grace isn't too useful without access to a flinch-inducing move, and Super Luck is, as the name implies, very luck-based.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Togetic has access to both Reflect and Light Screen but is unable to utilize them effectively because it has to hold Eviolite to retain its bulk and therefore cannot hold Light Clay to lengthen the number of turns the screens last.

A Wish set can be used, but due to Togetic's low HP stat, it is unable to heal much of its teammates' HP. Togetic has access to Encore, which allows it to lock foes into a favorable move, but Togetic tends not to have space on any set for it. Lastly, Flamethrower allows Togetic to hit Steel-types for super effective damage but uses up an important slot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types don't worry much about any move Togetic uses, bar Thunder Wave, and can either OHKO or 2HKO with a powerful STAB move. Nidoqueen and Nidoking get a special mention for being immune to Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, such as Magneton and Doublade, can easily switch into any move Togetic uses and proceed to 2HKO with a powerful STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Darmanitan and Choice Specs Rotom-C, don't worry too much about any of Togetic's moves, while they can either OHKO, 2HKO, or force it out due to their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Haze Users and Phazers</strong>: Pokemon that can remove stat boosts, such as Suicune and Haze Tentacruel, can stop Togetic's Nasty Plot set from being utilized effectively, but they don't really affect the support set.</p>",

Roost allows Togetic to reliably recover HP, which is essential for any wall.

However, if the alternate EV spread is used, be sure to send Togetic in against Fighting-types it can wall, such as Heracross and Machamp, and take advantage of them, but be wary of super effective coverage moves they tend to carry. Should Togetic and its teammates need entry hazards removed, try to use Defog as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical walls, such as Gligar and Suicune, make for good partners if the listed EV spread is in use, as they can wall the various physical attackers that threaten Togetic. Should the alternative EV spread be used, however, special walls, such as Blissey and Snorlax, make for optimal partners, as they can deal with the special attackers that trouble Togetic. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal, such as Moltres and Fletchinder, value Togetic as a teammate. Bulky Steel-types, such as Forretress and Mega Aggron, make for good teammates, as they resist or are immune to four of the types Togetic is weak to, namely Ice, Rock, Steel, and Poison.</p>"

  "Ampharos": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Ampharos has an extremely high Special Attack stat, good bulk for an attacker, and access to good offensive STAB attacks that hit almost every type for neutral damage. However, it has a limited movepool, which prevents Ampharos from utilizing many playstyles. Furthermore, Mega Ampharos's ability, Mold Breaker, is not particularly useful. Next, the release of ORAS brought many more checks to Ampharos than before, such as Mega Sceptile and Mega Swampert. It is also extremely slow for an attacker, as it has only a pitiful base 45 Speed stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is an option to cripple the specially defensive walls that stop Ampharos, but it takes the place of a coverage attack and isn't worth it. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple physical attackers, while Cotton Guard boosts Ampharos's Defense, but Ampharos cannot afford to miss out on one of its coverage moves. Signal Beam is an option for coverage against Grass-types that resist Thunderbolt, but it lacks good power and doesn't provide good coverage aside from that either. Iron Tail is an attacking option that allows Mega Ampharos to hit Fairy-types, but it is inaccurate and doesn't hit many other Pokemon. A dual screens set is an option, but not really worth it, as non-Mega Ampharos isn't good and Mega Ampharos cannot hold Light Clay, which means it cannot lengthen the duration of the screens. Hidden Power Grass is another option to use for hitting Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Mega Swampert harder, but it lacks power, doesn't provide good coverage, and isn't worth a moveslot. Hidden Power Ice can also be used to hit specially defensive Gligar. A mixed set is an option to break through special walls better, but it usually still lacks power and means that Ampharos has to miss out on an overall stronger Special Attack, which makes the set not worth using. Heal Bell is an option on the offensive set to act as an offensive cleric, but Mega Ampharos usually prefers running the other moves. Likewise, it can be put on the defensive set as Heal Bell can wake Mega Ampharos up when used by Sleep Talk, but it's hard to find room on the set for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Krookodile, Mega Swampert, and Nidoqueen can outspeed Mega Ampharos before it Mega Evolves and can beat it with one of their STAB attacks, though none of these Pokemon like to switch into a Dragon Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Snorlax, Blissey, and Florges can take any hit and KO Mega Ampharos with one of their attacks or just stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Super Effective Coverage Moves</strong>: Faster Pokemon with super effective coverage moves, such as Mamoswine, Hydreigon, Mega Glalie, and Mega Sceptile, can outspeed Mega Ampharos and pick it off.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest provides recovery for Ampharos, and when used with Sleep Talk, Ampharos is able to use a move while asleep. Volt Switch is a decent STAB attack and keeps up momentum for the team. Dragon Pulse can be used in the fourth slot, as it is a powerful STAB attack and hits Ground-types, which are immune to Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Static can paralyze foes if they make contact with Ampharos before it Mega Evolves. After Mega Evolving, Ampharos gets the ability Mold Breaker, which isn't very useful, but it does let Ampharos use Volt Switch against Mega Sceptile without boosting its Special Attack. Ampharosite allows Ampharos to Mega Evolve into Mega Ampharos. The EVs and Bold nature maximize Ampharos's Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ampharos can be sent in to wall a handful of Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-type attackers. Ampharos can also absorb sleep-inducing moves, as it has Sleep Talk and can attack while it's asleep. Volt Switch out to another Pokemon when you predict a threatening Pokemon to come in against Ampharos. However, do not recklessly spam it, as Ground-types can easily come in and force Ampharos to switch out after. Make sure to use Rest when Ampharos is getting low on health. Use Sleep Talk when asleep, as it will allow Ampharos to move during sleep. However, keep in mind that Rest puts Ampharos to sleep for two turns, so after Rest has been used, it is recommended that you use Sleep Talk for the next two turns and select another move the turn after. It is important to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Ampharos will get a huge boost in power, both offensively and defensively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicune is an example of a good teammate because it beats most Pokemon that threaten Ampharos, and Mega Ampharos can stall out Electric- and Grass-types that threaten Suicune. Pokemon that appreciate physical attackers such as Honchkrow being removed, such as Chandelure and Machamp, make for good partners as well. U-turn users such as Flygon and Infernape can form a VoltTurn core with Mega Ampharos and are therefore good teammates. Lastly, special walls that can take care of special attackers that threaten Mega Ampharos, such as Florges or Snorlax, are good teammates.</p>"

Dragon Pulse is another powerful STAB attack and provides great neutral coverage against Ground-type Pokemon. Focus Blast has terrifying overall coverage and hits many Pokemon, such as Snorlax, Porygon2, Rhyperior, and Umbreon, for super effective damage, but is inaccurate. Volt Switch allows Ampharos to keep up momentum for the team and switch out of its checks and counters that aren't immune to Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Static is Ampharos's ability before Mega Evolving; it can potentially paralyze a foe if the foe makes contact. Mold Breaker is Ampharos's ability after Mega Evolving, though it isn't very useful aside from letting Ampharos hit Mega Sceptile on the switch without boosting its Special Attack, as well as ignoring Mega Aggron's Filter and Rhyperior's Solid Rock. Ampharosite allows Ampharos to Mega Evolve into Mega Ampharos. The EV spread allows Mega Ampharos to outspeed uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon, but it also lets Ampharos hit as hard as possible and gives it a small boost in bulk. The Modest nature boosts Ampharos's damage output and backs up the investment in Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volt Switch to switch out of Ampharos's checks and counters if they aren't Ground-type and to also keep up momentum. Ampharos can also be used as a slow pivot. Ampharos can switch into Electric- and Fire-types attacks very well, and it can hit the foe with one of its STAB attacks. When predicting a Ground-type to come in, switch out Ampharos, because Ground-types are immune to Volt Switch. Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Ampharos will get a huge boost in power, both offensively and defensively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Ampharos appreciates Trick Room or Thunder Wave support to give it the chance to move first in most situations. Examples of good Trick Room setters include Bronzong and Cofagrigus. Wish support is also useful from Pokemon such as Umbreon or Blissey to boost Ampharos's longevity, as it doesn't have reliable recovery on its own. Other Volt Switch users or U-turn users such as Rotom-H and Flygon can form a VoltTurn core with Mega Ampharos. Pokemon that can reliably take care of Ground-types, such as Alomomola, Suicune, and Chesnaught, are good partners too. Finally, physically offensive attackers such as Mienshao, Lucario, and Krookodile make for good partners because they can get rid of special walls.</p>"

      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility allows Mega Ampharos to patch up its low Speed stat, hitting 400 Speed after an Agility. Thunderbolt is a powerful STAB attack that damages any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Dragon Pulse is another powerful secondary STAB attack, hitting opposing Dragon-types that threaten Mega Ampharos. Focus Blast has great Base Power along with terrifying coverage, but it has slightly low accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Static is Ampharos's ability before Mega Evolving and can paralyze foes if they make contact with Ampharos. Mold Breaker doesn't provide a lot of usefulness, yet it has the niche of not raising Mega Sceptile's Special Attack if it switches into Thunderbolt. It also bypasses Rhyperior's Solid Rock and Mega Aggron's Filter. Ampharosite is the standard item, as it allows Ampharos to Mega Evolve into Mega Ampharos. The invested EVs and Timid nature let Ampharos hit as hard as possible and outspeed everything up to neutral-natured base 150 Speed Pokemon after a boost, and the remaining EVs are put into HP to give a small boost to Ampharos's bulk. A Modest nature can instead be chosen to outspeed everything up to positive-natured base 120 Speed Pokemon, such as Sceptile, after an Agility, and it gives a good boost to Ampharos's Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as this will give Ampharos greater raw power as well as better bulk. Use Agility as foes switch out so that Mega Ampharos can get a free Speed boost without risking taking a hit. Don't spam Ampharos's STAB attacks when the opponent has a Ground- or Fairy-type available, because they can easily switch it in and force Ampharos out. This Ampharos is best used as a late-game cleaner once special walls have fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola and Florges are good teammates in particular, as they have good type synergy with Mega Ampharos and can provide Wish support to give a boost to Ampharos's longevity. Physically offensive attackers such as Mienshao or Krookodile make for good teammates, as they can beat the special walls that hinder Ampharos's sweep. Physically defensive walls such as Arcanine and Suicune make for good partners, as they can reliably take on the physical attackers that trouble Ampharos. Lastly, Grass-types such as Chesnaught or Shaymin help Ampharos by beating Ground-types that stop it.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>Quagsire's plethora of admirable defensive traits, such as its great typing, decent physical bulk, reliable recovery, and Unaware ability, allows it to maintain a niche on stall-based teams as a reliable check to threatening setup sweepers such as Mega Absol and Cobalion. Quagsire's Electric-type immunity and key resistances to Fire-, Steel-, and Rock-type moves alongside its access to Toxic also allow it to take full advantage of Unaware to tank various physical hits, stall foes, and overall fit very comfortably on defensive teams. Unfortunately, Quagsire's 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks leaves it extremely vulnerable to the likes of Celebi, Roserade, and Mega Sceptile, as well as to common carriers of Grass-type coverage such as Infernape and Heliolisk. Furthermore, Quagsire's middling mixed bulk leaves it susceptible to special attackers and especially powerful physical attackers such as Crawdaunt and Haxorus, and its passiveness makes Swampert a better decision on non-stall teams. Overall, Quagsire is a rather niche option that only fits on very defensive teams, but can be very beneficial for its teammates as a stop to certain setup sweepers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse can be used to boost Quagsire's Defense to extremely high levels as well as give its Earthquake a bit more power, though Quagsire usually prefers Toxic to hit Pokemon immune to Scald burns and is outdone as a Curse user by Gastrodon. Haze can also be used in order to remove the stat boosts of Pokemon that may use Quagsire as setup fodder, such as Suicune and Haxorus. However, Suicune is able to stall Quagsire out with Pressure, and Haxorus is capable of 2HKOing Quagsire unboosted, so this generally isn't preferred over Toxic. Encore is another option that can be used to lock entry hazard setters or status spreaders into their non-attacking moves, though this is hard to pull off given Quagsire's low Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Sceptile, Chesnaught, and Mega Abomasnow can reliably switch into either of Quagsire's STAB attacks and OHKO it with their respective super effective STAB attacks. Celebi and Roserade in particular are good counters, as they can OHKO Quagsire with Giga Drain and use Natural Cure to relieve any status conditions they've been inflicted with.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers like Kyurem and Sylveon can threaten to OHKO or 2HKO Quagsire with their respective STAB attacks due to its poor Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Common wielders of the move Taunt such as Hydreigon, Sableye, and Mega Aerodactyl can all outspeed and shut Quagsire down, as it will be restricted to two rather weak attacks and have no way of recovering bar Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Quagsire is easily worn down by common status ailments in burn and poison, as the former will chip it down, and the latter will force it to use Recover after it takes too much residual damage.</p>",

Recover allows Quagsire to remain healthy throughout the match as well as stall foes out after inflicting status on them. Lastly, Toxic can be used to punish Quagsire's common switch-ins in Hydreigon and Mega Blastoise; it aids Quagsire greatly in stalling these Pokemon out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in HP and Defense allow Quagsire to make as much use of its physical bulk as possible and reliably tank powerful physical attacks, such as Cobalion's Close Combat and Krookodile's Earthquake. A Relaxed nature is preferred, as it further increases Quagsire's physically defensive prowess while only taking away from its Speed, which it won't often rely on. Leftovers provides Quagsire with passive recovery at the end of every turn, which is important for avoiding 2HKOs from the likes of Mamoswine and Mega Swampert and retaliating with Toxic or Scald.</p> <h4>Usage Tip</h4> <p>It is best to avoid status conditions when using Quagsire, as burn slowly wears it down and Toxic puts it on an undesirable timer. Quagsire should be switched into physical setup sweepers, as its impressive physical bulk and ability allow it to reliably tank the hits of most physical setup sweepers that are known to threaten stall. Unless it is resisted or immune, Quagsire should almost never come in on special attacks due to its poor Special Defense and lack of investment. Toxic and Recover are both good options when predicting the opponent to switch, as Quagsire will be able to either cripple the opponent's switch-in or recover its health and switch out. Due to narrowly avoiding 2HKOs from the likes of Jolly Lucario and Crawdaunt, Quagsire should usually be preserved and close to full health before these threats are brought out in order to adequately check them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey is a great partner for Quagsire, as it is able to reliably switch into the special attacks Quagsire hates taking, such as any of Celebi's STAB attacks, Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, and Heliolisk's Grass Knot. Furthermore, Blissey is able to utilize its access to Heal Bell to heal Quagsire of any status ailments it's been hit with. Other specially bulky Pokemon, such as Porygon2 and Goodra, are also able to tank certain hits for Quagsire quite well. Pokemon that are able to tank Grass-type attacks, such as specially defensive Bronzong and Mega Aggron, are able to help compensate for Quagsire's 4x Grass weakness. Given their access to Heal Bell, Sylveon and Umbreon also make for good partners, as they are able to heal status ailments Quagsire is burdened with during a match. Additionally, both are able to provide decent offensive presence in the forms of Pixilate Hyper Voice and Foul Play, which can help compensate for Quagsire's lack of power. Quagsire is easily worn down by entry hazards, so it appreciates Defog or Rapid Spin support from the likes of Gligar, Mandibuzz, and Forretress. Roserade and Chesnaught both function as decent semi-stall partners for Quagsire, as both are able to come in on Grass-type attacks that it hates taking as well as provide it with Leech Seed support. Sableye is also able to function as a semi-stall partner for Quagsire, as it is able to invest in Special Defense and form a decent defensive core to help Quagsire with its low Special Defense. Additionally, Sableye can cripple especially powerful physical attackers that are able to break Quagsire, such as Lucario and Haxorus, with priority Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

Espeon also has great Special Attack and decent Speed, which allows it to outspeed threats such as Cobalion and apply good offensive pressure. Psychic is a great offensive typing in UU, where there are many Fighting-types. While Espeon is not known for being a defensive threat, its decent Special Defense allows it to take a few special attacks, especially alongside Morning Sun. What holds Espeon back is its shallow offensive movepool, which makes it difficult to deal with most Steel-types. Furthermore, its Psychic typing gives it rather common weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type moves. Finally, its lackluster Defense often prevents it from taking advantage of its ability or switching in on most of the threats it checks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf can allow Espeon to be a decent cleaner that outspeeds fast Mega Evolutions such as Mega Aerodactyl, but such sets lack offensive pressure and are easy to switch into. A dual screens set might seem good on paper, but Espeon is usually more suited to an offensive role. A Focus Sash set is a very solid anti-lead for offensive teams, but it is usually restricted to very fast-paced teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Naturally faster Pokemon, such as Mega Aerodactyl, and common Choice Scarf users, such as Heracross, are among the best Espeon checks and can easily force it out.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users</strong>: Pursuit users such as Krookodile can easily check Espeon by trapping and KOing it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Espeon has problems getting through most Steel-types, especially Doublade, which can set up on Espeon that lack Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority easily stops Espeon in its tracks, especially if it's been worn down already. Powerful priority users that check Espeon include Lucario and Entei.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types, especially those that also carry recovery, such as Umbreon and Mandibuzz, are great answers to Espeon because they are immune to its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Blissey and Florges can tank some hits from Espeon, but they have a hard time against the Calm Mind set.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic, Espeon's main STAB move, allows it to break through both offensive threats, such as Cobalion, and defensive threats, such as Whimsicott. Dazzling Gleam is a must-have in order to hit prominent Dark-types in the metagame, such as Hydreigon and Krookodile. It also hits Dragon-types fairly hard. Shadow Ball allows Espeon to deal heavy damage to the Psychic- and Ghost-types that usually switch into it, such as Doublade and Reuniclus. Trick is a great option for the 4th moveslot, it lets Espeon heavily cripple some common switch-ins, such as Mandibuzz and Curse Snorlax. Psyshock is here to hit special walls such as Florges and Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread used in the set maximizes Espeon's Special Attack and provides enough Speed to outspeed Heliolisk and Speed tie with Froslass. Magic Bounce allows Espeon to block entry hazards and status. Choice Specs gives Espeon overwhelming power, allowing it to trouble many offensive team archetypes and walls such as Blissey and Florges.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is great at revenge killing relatively healthy threats. Send Espeon in on a predicted support move, such as Stealth Rock. If the opponent has a dedicated lead, such as Krookodile, Espeon can also force it out quite easily and then start to weaken the opposing team. Bringing Espeon in via VoltTurn is a great idea, as Espeon is too frail to switch into normal attacks. Espeon can switch safely into Pokemon that use support moves, such as Blissey, as they can't do much to it in return.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Espeon has a much easier time cleaning with entry hazards on the opposing field; as such, Pokemon such as Krookodile are good teammates. Dark- and Steel-types force Espeon out, so it greatly appreciates Fighting-types such as Cobalion. Espeon has difficulties switching into powerful attacks, so Pokemon with access to either Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Mienshao and Crobat, are good teammates. Espeon fits incredibly well on offensive archetypes and pairs well with setup sweepers, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados, that appreciate Espeon's wallbreaking prowess. Cleaners such as Mega Sharpedo also greatly appreciate Espeon's ability to wear down threats. Wallbreakers such as Heracross are also good teammates.</p>"

Psyshock is a must-have in order to beat Suicune, Snorlax, Florges, Blissey, and other special sponges quickly so that they can't leave Espeon in KO range for a priority move. Stored Power is also a nice option, allowing Espeon to OHKO Cobalion after two boosts. Morning Sun is a great move to recover any HP Espeon lost due to residual damage and allows it to stall out opposing special attackers. Dazzling Gleam gives Espeon a way to check Hydreigon and hit every Dark-type in UU at least neutrally.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Espeon to hit as hard and fast as possible. Magic Bounce allows Espeon to be a unique sweeper that can't be phazed, Taunted, or statused while also granting its team great entry hazard control. Leftovers is the preferred item to increase Espeon's longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set shines against more passive teams that rely on status or moves like Roar to check setup sweepers. Avoid directly switching Espeon in, as it is really frail and needs to be as healthy as possible to sweep effectively. Use Morning Sun wisely; remember that you have only 8 PP. Keep in mind that Espeon can still become statused by moves such as Scald and Sludge Bomb, so avoid them wherever possible. Pokemon that Espeon can set up easily on include Suicune, Florges, and Cresselia.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Swampert that can deal with Dark- and Steel-types are great teammates. Swampert also easily deals with Doublade, one of the best checks to Espeon. Volt Switch and U-turn users are also great teammates, as they can bring Espeon in safely when you predict the opponent to use entry hazard or setup moves. Pokemon that require entry hazard control, such as Gyarados and Mega Aerodactyl, appreciate Magic Bounce.</p>"

Furthermore, its incredible 95 / 110 / 130 bulk and mono-Dark typing let it stand up to a decent number of attackers in UU. However, many Pokemon that Umbreon would like to wall often carry a coverage or utility move to stop it cold: Focus Blast is common on Mega Sceptile, Choice Specs Kyurem, and Choice Specs Hydreigon; Nidoqueen and Life Orb Hydreigon can carry Taunt; and Life Orb Roserade frequently carry Sleep Powder. Additionally, reliance on Wish + Protect to keep itself healthy can often cause the Umbreon user to lose momentum against offensive teams, especially because Umbreon allows threats such as Conkeldurr, Sylveon, and Cobalion to switch in with little risk. In general, Blissey, Sylveon, and Florges are more reliable special walls and clerics.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is another option instead of Foul Play or Protect in order to apply defensive pressure against bulky teams. Taunt is an interesting option to use over Wish that can let Umbreon reliably stall out Reuniclus, a major threat to most stall teams. Sucker Punch is an extremely niche option, but can help certain teams pick off Nasty Plot Celebi and Hoopa.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Conkeldurr is a major thorn in Umbreon's side as it's able to set up easily against Umbreon or just threaten to fire off powerful attacks. Cobalion and Lucario can use Umbreon as setup fodder thanks to their typing and Justified.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong> Pokemon such as Choice Band Entei, Choice Band Haxorus, and Choice Specs Sylveon can threaten huge damage on Umbreon and its teammates, although the former two cannot come in safely on a Foul Play. Other examples are Life Orb Metagross, Choice Specs or Life Orb Hydreigon, and Mega Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Fighting Coverage</strong> Many special attackers carry Fighting coverage which threatens to easily 2HKO Umbreon. Examples are Focus Blast on Choice Specs Hydreigon, Choice Specs Kyurem, Mega Abomasnow, Nidoking, and Reuniclus, Superpower on Choice Band Krookodile, Life Orb Tornadus, and Mega Absol, and Aura Sphere on Mega Blastoise.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Tornadus, Hydreigon, and Crobat can use Taunt to shut Umbreon down, keeping it weak enough for themselves or their teammates to finish off.</p> <p><strong>Trick Users</strong>: A well-timed Trick by a Rotom-C or Chandelure can cripple Umbreon by deterring it from using its utility-based moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Florges, and Curse Snorlax are some of the bulky sweepers that can set up on Umbreon.</p>",

Umbreon is best used to sponge a variety of high-powered hits in order to provide excellent team support. While it can handle many all-out attackers and Choice item users fairly easily, Umbreon struggles against several setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Celebi, Nasty Plot Infernape, Swords Dance Cobalion, and Bulk Up Conkeldurr. Foul Play alongside Wish + Protect allows Umbreon to be self-reliant in certain situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Umbreon functions well alongside Pokemon such as Crobat or Gligar, as they can take on some of its Fighting-type counters and provide utility and pivot support with Defog and U-turn. Umbreon works well alongside Swampert, as most Taunt users, such as Aerodactyl, Krookodile, and Crobat, are frail or fear Swampert's typing. Umbreon appreciates Rapid Spin and Defog support, as this makes its job a little easier.</p>"

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>As the only remaining Water / Psychic Pokemon in UU, Slowking has much to offer to the tier. Slowking fits on nearly every playstyle, as it has the potential to fill many possible roles with different sets. Its unique typing gives it an excellent set of resistances and is complemented by its great natural bulk. The ability Regenerator allows Slowking to stay healthy throughout the course of a battle and perform its role reliably. In addition, Slowking has a stellar movepool with a diverse set of boosting, attacking, and utility moves as well as guaranteed recovery in Slack Off. Its biggest flaws lie in its weaknesses to the common Dark-, Grass-, and Electric-types of the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is a more accurate alternative to Fire Blast on offensive variants of Slowking. Defensive variants can use Counter and Foul Play, although these moves are very situational. Slowking can also use Toxic on defensive sets to cripple certain switch-ins, such as Vaporeon and Mega Blastoise. A RestTalk set with Dragon Tail and Scald is plausible, as it negates any status inflicted on Slowking. Finally, Slowking has access to Curse and physical attacks such as Aqua Tail, Zen Headbutt, Drain Punch, and Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric- and Grass-types</strong>: Powerful attackers such as Heliolisk and Life Orb Shaymin force Slowking out immediately, though they must watch out for Choice Specs-boosted attacks. All Electric-types and Natural Cure Grass-types do not fear paralysis from Slowking's Defensive set. Whimsicott can switch into almost all of Slowking's moves and threaten it with a Grass move or lock it into a setup move with Encore. Mega Ampharos can take all of Slowking's attacks and keep itself healthy with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hydreigon is one of Slowking's best answers, as it only has to fear Thunder Wave and Choice Specs Ice Beam or Focus Blast. Powerful Knock Off users such as Mega Absol and Krookodile can cripple or KO Slowking, though they have trouble switching into Scald or Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All Slowking variants are crippled by Toxic and severely hampered by burns. Defensive Pokemon that carry Toxic, such as Blissey, can switch into Slowking easily and inflict status on it. Toxic Spikes can cripple or put heavy pressure on Slowking.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Slowking's main STAB move and is respectably strong while having a chance to burn enemies. Slack Off restores half of Slowking's health and, along with Regenerator, lets it easily stay healthy throughout a match. Thunder Wave cripples some common offensive switch-ins to Slowking, such as Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo, and offers a lot of utility in general. Psyshock is the primary option in the last slot that provides Slowking with a secondary STAB move to hit Poison-types and Fighting-types, such as Roserade, Machamp, and Crobat, for significant damage. Alternatively, Dragon Tail can be used to rack up entry hazard damage on targets and preventing boosted Pokemon such as Suicune from sweeping, while Ice Beam allows Slowking to hit Dragon-types and Ice-types that resist its Scald.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the given EV spread and nature, Slowking has great physical bulk and is able reliably counter the myriad of Fire-, Rock-, and Fighting-types, such as Cobalion, Infernape, Entei, Mega Aerodactyl, and Darmanitan. Its Special Defense is impressive even without EV investment and allows it to check the likes of Dragalge quite well. Regenerator restores 1/3 of Slowking's HP whenever it switches out, making it less reliant on using turns to Slack Off. Leftovers adds to Slowking's passive recovery.</p> <p>Alternatively, Slowking can use a more specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 SpD with a Calm nature in order to more reliably switch into powerful special attackers, such as Life Orb Nidoqueen, while still retaining the ability to check common physical attackers, such as Choice Scarf Darmanitan. However, keep in mind that this spread fares a lot worse against powerful physical wallbreakers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defensive Slowking is best used on balanced teams with a defensive partners to fall back upon. Slowking can use its great resistances to wall certain Pokemon such as Mienshao and Darmanitan, but it must be careful of switching into U-turn. Avoid letting Slowking get burned or poisoned, as both cripple it to the point of no longer being able to switch into Pokemon. Use Dragon Tail against obvious switches that can take any of Slowking's other moves, such as Shaymin. If using Calm Mind, do not attempt to sweep until powerful Electric- and Grass-types have been removed. While Slowking can phaze RestTalk Suicune, it cannot deal with Substitute + Calm Mind variants, which set up easily on Defensive Slowking that lack Calm Mind.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowking is crippled by burns and poison, so cleric support is greatly appreciated. Florges is an example of a cleric that has great defensive synergy with Slowking. Pokemon that can deal with strong Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon are necessary as teammates. Chesnaught makes for an excellent partner, as it can check these types while also absorbing Knock Off and setting up Spikes to take advantage of Slowking's Dragon Tail.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room lets Slowking and its slower teammates move first in battle against most other Pokemon. Scald can be used as a Water-type STAB move to attempt to cripple switch-ins such as Empoleon early in the game while also deterring physical attackers from staying in on Slowking. Surf can be used instead for more power than Scald. Psyshock is Slowking's secondary STAB move and lets Slowking deal good damage to special walls. Slowking can use a coverage move in the final slot: Fire Blast hits Steel- and Grass-types harder than other moves, while Ice Beam hits the Grass- and Dragon-types that typically give Slowking trouble. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used to boost Slowking's Special Attack and complements its decent natural power, letting it defeat Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Calm Mind Suicune. Slowking has access to more coverage moves, including Grass Knot and Focus Blast.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Slowking's Special Attack is maximized with 252 EVs and a Quiet nature so that it can hit as hard as possible. 252 HP EVs give Slowking much-needed bulk. 0 Speed IVs combined with a Quiet nature allow Slowking to underspeed the entire tier under Trick Room. Leftovers increases Slowking's longevity and somewhat mitigates passive damage caused by status; on the other hand, Life Orb greatly increases Slowking's power, giving it an easier time against walls such as Vaporeon. Colbur Berry is an option to allow Slowking to reliably survive most Dark-type attacks and set up Trick Room, but this should only be used on fully offensive teams that revolve around Trick Room being set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works well on very offensive teams, especially those that have other members that can make use of Slowking's Trick Room. However, offensive Trick Room Slowking is also a good stand-alone sweeper and win condition that doesn't need to support its teammates, especially if it carries Nasty Plot. Slowking's bulk, typing, and recovery provided by Regenerator allow it to often set up multiple times in a game. It can set up on the plethora of Pokemon that can't do much to Slowking, including Suicune, Forretress, and Arcanine. On Trick Room teams, Slowking should use Trick Room first early-game on a setup opportunity to give itself and its teammates more options the following turn. However, it should use Nasty Plot first, followed by Trick Room, when attempting to sweep or wallbreak so that it has more turns to deal damage under Trick Room.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slower Pokemon that can abuse Trick Room, such as Rhyperior, Mega Ampharos, and Snorlax, make for great partners to Slowking. In particular, Escavalier and Mega Abomasnow have great type synergy with Slowking; Slowking can stand up to the Fire- and Steel-types that give these two Pokemon trouble, while both of the two can handle Grass-types and Mega Abomasnow can check most Electric-types. Entry hazard support, especially Toxic Spikes, makes it much easier for Slowking and its teammates to break down walls.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Slowking's Special Attack and Special Defense, while Nasty Plot is an alternate choice that boosts Slowking's Special Attack more quickly but leaves it more vulnerable to special attackers. Scald and Psyshock are Slowking's STAB moves, the former of which threatens physical attackers and the latter of which helps Slowking defeat other Calm Mind users and special walls. Slack Off lets Slowking stay healthy while it boosts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs and nature maximize Slowking's Defense. No Special Defense investment is needed if it will be boosted with Calm Mind, but a mixed spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 SpD with a Calm nature can be used if Nasty Plot is the boosting move of choice. Regenerator restores 33% of Slowking's HP as it switches out, allowing it to be less reliant on Slack Off. Leftovers provides Slowking with additional passive recovery and keeps it healthy in tandem with Regenerator and Slack Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best on balanced teams that need a win condition against opposing Calm Mind users such as Suicune and Florges. Slowking can check and set up on Fire- and Fighting-types thanks to its typing. However, it should not attempt to sweep while faster powerful attackers with super effective moves, such as Mega Ampharos, Krookodile, and Shaymin, remain healthy on the opponent's side.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowking pairs well with Florges or Aromatisse, as Slowking checks Fire- and Steel-types while the Fairies check other special attackers and provide Slowking with cleric support. Toxic Spikes must be cleared for this set to perform its role; Roserade absorbs them, has good synergy with Slowking, and can also set up Toxic Spikes of its own. Guts Machamp can take advantage of status directed at Slowking and can check threats such as Hydreigon.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Slowking's best Water-type STAB move and is respectably powerful with a chance to burn its targets. Either Psychic or Psyshock can be used as the second STAB move; Psychic hits harder overall, while Psyshock does more damage to special walls such as Vaporeon and Blissey. Dragon Tail is a very useful move that deters foes from setting up and provides chip damage on Slowking's switch-ins. Fire Blast deals considerable damage to Steel- and Grass-types, such as Mega Aggron and Shaymin, respectively. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass- and Dragon types, including Hydreigon, one of Slowking's most common switch-ins. Other possible coverage moves include Focus Blast, which hits certain special walls such as Umbreon, and Grass Knot, which hits opposing Water-types such as Swampert and Mega Blastoise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest allows Slowking to easily tank most special attacks from the likes of Nidoqueen and Dragalge. 252 EVs are placed into Special Attack with a Modest nature to allow Slowking to hit as hard as possible, complementing its respectable base 100 Special Attack. 252 EVs in HP give Slowking great bulk. The remaining EVs are placed into Speed to let Slowking outspeed other base 30 Speed Pokemon, such as Snorlax and opposing Slowking. Regenerator restores 33% of Slowking's HP when it switches out, enabling it to stay relatively healthy throughout the length of a battle. A Quiet nature with the extra EVs placed into Special Defense can be used in order for Dragon Tail to hit slightly harder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works well on bulky offense and functions as a pivot and a special tank while also hitting hard thanks to the investment in Special Attack. Slowking can check a large number of special attackers and can switch into those that don't have a STAB super effective move, such as Nidoqueen, Infernape, and Espeon. In addition, it can check specially-oriented setup sweepers that lack Substitute thanks to Dragon Tail. If absolutely necessary, Slowking can tank super effective STAB moves from full health such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, Life Orb Shaymin's Seed Flare, and Mega Ampharos's Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A burn or poison severely hampers Slowking's ability to check special attackers, so a status absorber or a cleric is useful. Guts Heracross works particularly well as a partner, as it absorbs status and pressures the defensive Pokemon that give Slowking trouble. Florges and Aromatisse have good synergy with Slowking, and the former can check some special attackers that give Slowking trouble, such as Mega Blastoise, Mega Ampharos, and Hydreigon. Chesnaught is a good physically defensive Pokemon to pair with Slowking; it provides Spikes to complement Slowking's Dragon Tail and can check certain Pokemon that give Slowking trouble, such as Roserade.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Surf is Slowking's most powerful Water-type STAB move; Scald is nearly as powerful and has a chance to burn targets. Psyshock hits special walls such as Blissey on their weaker physical defense; Future Sight is enormously powerful and puts huge pressure on opposing switch-ins. Fire Blast and Ice Beam both hit Grass-types that can otherwise switch in easily to Slowking, but Ice Beam also hits Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Ampharos for super effective damage. Trick cripples special walls that give Slowking trouble, such as Umbreon and Vaporeon. Alternate moves include Focus Blast, which deals major damage to many of Slowking's switch-ins such as Umbreon, Porygon2, and Empoleon, and Grass Knot which dents opposing Water-types, such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack is maximized with 252 EVs and a Modest nature to hit as hard as possible. Choice Specs enables Slowking to function as a surprisingly strong wallbreaker. 252 EVs in HP are used to make Slowking bulkier, as significant Speed investment is not necessary thanks to Slowking's dismal base Speed. The remaining EVs are placed into Speed to outspeed other base 30 Speed Pokemon such as Snorlax. Regenerator makes it difficult for enemies to wear Slowking down and allows it to use its resistances to switch in multiple times throughout a game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Slowking works best on bulky offense. It can serve as a check to several attackers due to its bulk and typing and proceed to fire off powerful Choice Specs-boosted attacks. Use an appropriate coverage move on Pokemon that are likely to switch in initially, such as Psyshock on Roserade or Ice Beam on Hydreigon. Use Trick to cripple walls and bulky setup sweepers, such as Umbreon and CurseLax, respectively. Follow up Future Sight by pivoting into another powerful wallbreaker that can defeat Pokemon that are likely to switch in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowking appreciates partners that are immune to Volt Switch, as it cannot OHKO most Electric-types and is forced out after they switch in. Mega Sceptile works well, as it checks most Electric- and Grass-types and appreciates Slowking's ability to wear down or cripple special walls. Physical wallbreakers such as Lucario and Darmanitan can break through many of Slowking's counters. Heracross has fantastic synergy with Slowking, especially if Slowking carries Future Sight, as Heracross destroys all Pokemon that can take a Choice Specs-boosted Future Sight, such as Umbreon and Empoleon. Choice Band Goodra also has great synergy with Slowking, especially with Sap Sipper, and it can defeat opposing special walls. Trick Room support can turn Choice Specs Slowking into a \"fast\" wallbreaker, although Slowking doesn't synergize well with most Trick Room setters.</p>"

  "Forretress": {
    "overview": "<p>Forretress benefits from great 140 Defense that lets it serve as the mainstream physical sponge to the majority of the tier and it also has access to Rapid Spin. It also comes with two handy abilities: Sturdy ensures that Forretress will survive any one hit while Overcoat protects it from powder moves and hail damage. Forretress's main role is to serve as an entry hazard stacker and spinner. Having access to Volt Switch also allows Forretress to serve as a slow defensive pivot that helps retain momentum. Forretress's usable base 90 Attack allows for a decent-hitting Gyro Ball, letting it take on some fast and frail threats. Unfortunately, poor attacking options make it setup bait, and its poor base 60 Special Defense does not aid in helping Forretress do its main jobs.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic Spikes is a rarely used option due to the plethora of Defog users and Poison-types; however, it is still an option if one opts to use it. An alternate spread of 80 or 120 Attack EVs can be used for harder hitting Gyro Balls on the defensive set. One can opt to use Earthquake in order to hit Fire-types on the switch. Counter can also be utilized with Sturdy on the defensive spread in order to better take on Haxorus, Machamp, and other bulky physical attackers; however, Gyro Ball is generally the superior option against Mega Aerodactyl and frail attackers. Pin Missile can be used to surprise Celebi, which can otherwise begin setting up Nasty Plots on Forretress. On the Custap set, a bulkier EV spread of 252 Atk / 252 Def along with 0 Special Defense IVs can be used to ensure Forretress takes on physical attackers well while still easily getting put into Custap Berry range.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types:</strong> Forretress hates Scald users, especially Defog Empoleon.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types:</strong> All Fire-types, notably Chandelure, Entei, and Arcanine, give Forretress trouble. Pokemon such as Noivern and Hydreigon that have access to common Fire-type moves also cause grief for Forretress.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users:</strong> Taunt users shut Forretress down, as they prevent it from setting up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers:</strong> Bulky setup sweepers such as Suicune and Conkeldurr, as well as Substitute + Calm Mind users such as Chandelure, will be able to set up on Forretress.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce:</strong> Espeon or Xatu bounce back Forretress's entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Trick Users:</strong> Forretress needs to anticipate Choiced Trick users, such as Metagross, that like to cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Spinblockers:</strong> Ghost-type Pokemon such as Doublade, Chandelure, and Sableye all prevent Forretress from using Rapid Spin and can threaten Forretress with status or strong attacks or use it as setup fodder.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>First and foremost, Forretress's job is to use Rapid Spin and keep entry hazards off your side of the field. The choice of entry hazard is team-dependent; if another Pokemon has Stealth Rock, you should run Spikes and set up dual entry hazards. Volt Switch turns Forretress into a defensive pivot by retaining momentum against switch-ins. The choice between Gyro Ball and Toxic is a matter of preference; Gyro Ball lets Forretress take on fast Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mienshao, Crobat, and Whimsicott, while Toxic cripples most of Forretress's common switch-ins, including Swampert and Alomomola. Heavy Slam is an option over Gyro Ball as well that allows Forretress to heavily damage or outright OHKO slower Fairy-type Pokemon such as Sylveon and Florges, which can use their recovery moves to stall out Gyro Ball.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers ensures longevity and passive recovery. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Forretress to maximize its defensive bulk. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 16 Def / 240 SpD allows Forretress to switch in more easily against special attackers such as Sylveon, Kyurem, and Celebi and makes entry hazard stacking or spinning a little easier, while still maintaining an impressive Defense stat. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs should be used if one opts for Gyro Ball, and it also ensures that Forretress is slower than most opposing Pokemon when using Volt Switch to bring in a teammate safely. Sturdy guarantees that Forretress will be able to use Rapid Spin or Volt Switch or set up entry hazards, assuming it is at full HP. Alternatively, Overcoat allows Forretress to work around threats such as Roserade and avoid damage from hail.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to avoid using Forretress as a lead. Instead, use it to take hits from a variety of strong physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Mienshao. As a defensive pivot, it benefits from Wish support to help utilize its \"sponge and switch\" tactics. While Forretress cannot effectively wall many Pokemon over the long term, it is very effective at pivoting into attacks and Volt Switching out to safely bring in a teammate. Once you've done your job with Forretress, it is okay to use it as death fodder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set works extremely well with bulky Water-types such as Alomomola or Suicune, and it appreciates additional utility support from pivots such as Gligar or Crobat. Slow Volt Switch works well with wallbreakers and stallbreakers, such as Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Hydreigon. Cleric support from the likes of Sylveon and Florges is especially helpful, as Forretress is prone to being worn down and vulnerable to Scald burns. Forretress works well with fast Taunt users that can help prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up entry hazards Defogging away its own hazards. It also appreciates Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Krookodile that can take care of spinblockers.</p>"
      },
      "Custap": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a great entry hazard that damages all types of Pokemon. Explosion allows Forretress to get off a lot of damage on foes as well as prevent slower Pokemon from using Rapid Spin or Defog that turn, and it works well in conjunction with Custap Berry. Spikes is another amazing entry hazard that damages grounded foes and works great for wearing down walls, as it doesn't account for typing, unlike Stealth Rock. Toxic Spikes can also be used to wear down walls, as they don't appreciate being poisoned upon switching in. Rapid Spin allows Forretress to remove entry hazards for its teammates. On the other hand, Gyro Ball allows Forretress to beat quicker suicide leads, such as Froslass and Aerodactyl.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs allow Forretress to hit as hard as possible with Explosion and Gyro Ball, while maximum Speed EVs allow Hasty Forretress to outspeed everything up to uninvested Blastoise and everything up to uninvested base 65 Speed Pokemon with a Lonely nature. While a Hasty nature does allow Forretress to hit a more significant Speed benchmark, a Lonely nature allows Forretress to hit harder with Explosion and Gyro Ball. Both natures are used with minimum HP, Defense, and Special Defense IVs to ensure Forretress gets knocked down to Sturdy or Custap Berry range as easily as possible. Custap Berry is used as the item to allow Forretress to outspeed foes using moves in the same priority bracket and either hit them with a powerful Explosion or Gyro Ball, set an entry hazard, or use Rapid Spin to remove opposing entry hazards for its teammates before Forretress is KOed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used as a suicide lead on offensive teams most of the time, as it is able to set entry hazards, prevent their removal, and explode to bring it in its teammates safely. Should a potential Rapid Spin or Defog user attempt to remove entry hazards against Forretress, keep setting entry hazards until Forretress is knocked into the range of Custap Berry and proceed to use Explosion to ensure the preservation of any hazards Forretress has previously set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Pokemon, such as Lucario, Infernape, and Entei, capitalize on Forretress's ability to successfully set up entry hazards which weaken their checks and counters, making them good teammates. Mega Aerodactyl is a particularly good teammate to Forretress, as it is able to threaten every Defog user in the tier. Ghost-types, such as Doublade and Sableye, also make for good teammates, as they are immune to Rapid Spin. Sableye is a particularly good teammate, as it can also Taunt opposing Defoggers to prevent them from removing Forretress's entry hazards.</p>"

  "Gligar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gligar is a great Pokemon in the UU metagame, boasting awesome bulk thanks to its 65 / 105 / 65 defenses coupled with Eviolite. Its typing gives Gligar immunities to Ground and Electric and resistances to common types in UU, such as Bug and Fighting. Thanks to its typing, it is also the only Flying-type in UU that isn't weak to Stealth Rock, making it a reliable Defogger, as it isn't worn down as easily as other common Defoggers in UU. It also sports an impressive support movepool with moves such as Taunt, Knock Off, U-turn, Stealth Rock, Defog, and Roost. While Gligar has an amazing movepool, typing, and stats, its reliance on Eviolite for its bulk means it must watch out for Knock Off, which runs rampant throughout UU. Knock Off is also a common coverage move on a lot of Fighting-types that Gligar would otherwise have no trouble switching into. Another problem Gligar has is that while it is one of the most reliable Defoggers, its preferred ability, Immunity, is illegal in conjunction with Defog. Gligar's 4x weakness to Ice can be problematic when trying to fit it onto teams. Another flaw is its poor offensive potential, meaning U-turn is almost a necessity to maintain momentum.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt can be used with a faster EV spread, as Gligar outspeeds a lot of walls and can easily force them out after it used Taunt. Toxic + Immunity can be used to outstall a lot of Pokemon, as with Immunity, a burn is the only status effect that can wear Gligar down, and Toxic puts the foe on a turn-by-turn timer. Knock Off cripples other walls that may switch into Gligar. Acrobatics can be used in place of Earthquake to check Swords Dance Heracross better, as it tends use Knock Off or Swords Dance when facing Gligar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is extremely common in the UU metagame, and as such, Gligar must be wary of losing its Eviolite, which highly compromises its bulk.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune are great switch-ins to Gligar, as they can not only switch into any of Gligar's attacks, but also use their effective STAB moves with which to hit Gligar for great damage.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Most setup sweepers, such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, Calm Mind Cresselia, Hone Claws Mega Aerodactyl, and Dragon Dance Gyarados, can easily set up on Gligar, especially if it lacks U-turn, as Gligar has poor offensive potential. Substitute setup sweepers in particular, such as Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune, give Gligar trouble, as its U-turn cannot break their Substitutes.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While it is immune to Thunder Wave, burns still cripple Gligar, putting it on a timer while weakening the power of its moves. Toxic can also hit non-Immunity variants of Gligar, pressuring it even more.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Gligar is severely hampered by Taunt, and there are many faster Taunt users in UU, such as Krookodile, Crobat, and Mega Aerodactyl.</p>",

      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake punishes Pokemon Gligar checks like Cobalion and Infernape, preventing them from freely setting up. U-turn allows Gligar to be an effective pivot, especially after switching into Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Celebi, bringing in a teammate capable of capitalizing on the free switch. Roost allows Gligar to consistently check the variety of threats in the tier. Gligar is an effective user of Defog, especially when dealing with opposing Spikes and Toxic Spikes by virtue of its Flying typing making it immune to them. Stealth Rock is another utility move Gligar can use if no other teammate is able to fit it into their kit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is vital on Gligar to give it the boosted defense stats required to check Pokemon like Hydreigon and Cobalion effectively. The Special Defense investment allows it to switch into special attackers such as Hydreigon and avoid the OHKO from non-Life Orb or Meadow Plate Celebi's +2 Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock then proceed to switch out with its slow U-turn. An Impish nature allows Gligar to avoid the 2HKO from +2 Cobalion's Iron Head after Stealth Rock damage. Hyper Cutter is used alongside Defog, as Immunity is incompatible with it. If running Stealth Rock, Immunity is the preferred ability, as it allows Gligar to be a Toxic absorber in certain instances. A Careful nature with an EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 212 SpD can be used to help Gligar take on Choice Specs Hydreigon better without being detrimental to its matchup against Cobalion, as it can almost always avoid the 2HKO from both of them after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gligar's primary role should be to serve as a slow bulky pivot capable of bringing a teammate into a favorable position. This should be achieved on a predicted switch or against threats like Hydreigon and Fighting-types like Cobalion and Infernape, which it can safely switch into. Gligar's ability to check these threats is heavily improved by its Eviolite making it bulkier. However, Gligar's over reliance on Eviolite means it must be wary of Knock Off users. While it can comfortably switch into most Fighting-types, a few like Mienshao and Heracross have access to Knock Off, making it so it must fear losing its item when pivoting into them. Krookodile is a Stealth Rock user with access to Knock Off to punish Gligar while also shutting it down with Taunt to prevent it from using Roost or removing or setting hazards. However, these Knock Off user tend to run Choice items, making them difficult to pivot into, so you should not fear switching Gligar in against these threats. Gligar will then be able to take advantage of them by using Defog or Stealth Rock to assist its teammates. Gligar should be kept healthy with Roost if it is necessary to keep multiple threats in check; otherwise, using U-turn to generate momentum or its utility moves should be favored.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is a fantastic partner alongside Gligar, as it is able to revenge kill Celebi with Pursuit following a slow U-turn. Mega Aerodactyl also appreciates the free switch against many offensive teams, allowing it to fire off a strong attack. Water-types like Mega Blastoise, Empoleon, and Suicune work well in covering Gligar's weaknesses to Ice and Water; in return, Gligar can pivot into the Electric-type moves aimed at them. Slowking is another Water-type that checks threats like Entei and Mamoswine, which threaten Gligar, as well as helping pivot around Nidoqueen, which can threaten both of them with its coverage options. Slowking also provides a secondary Fighting-resistant Pokemon, taking pressure off Gligar and stopping it from being overwhelmed by them and the special threats it wants to check. Cobalion appreciates Gligar covering the Fighting- and Ground-types that threaten Cobalion and having the ability to be brought in safely against Pokemon like Hydreigon. Wallbreakers such as Entei, Hydreigon, and Mega Abomasnow are great partners that appreciate the breaking opportunities Gligar gives them after a slow U-turn. Mega Abomasnow can also check Gligar's weaknesses and pressure Pokemon like Suicune, Mega Swampert, and Mamoswine, which can all take advantage of Gligar. VoltTurn partners like Mega Beedrill and Rotom-C work well with Gligar on offensive teams, as they value the utility Gligar provides and the momentum core it creates with them. Rotom-C also appreciates Gligar luring in Water-types like Tentacruel and Gyarados to get it into a favorable position to fire off its strong STAB moves. Toxic Spikes absorbers pair nicely with Gligar, as the most common user in Tentacruel can punish it with Scald or Knock Off. Roserade, Toxicroak, and the previously mentioned Mega Beedrill can fulfill this role, and the former two can also pressure Water-types like Suicune and Mega Swampert for Gligar.</p>"

  "Steelix": {
    "overview": "<p>Steelix's Mega Evolution grants it better Attack, Defense, and Special Defense stats. Most notable is its sky-high base 230 Defense stat, tying with Mega Aggron's. Mega Steelix faces hefty competition from Mega Aggron, which is an arguably better tank because of its ability, Filter; however, Mega Steelix does have more special bulk than Mega Aggron as well as a stronger Earthquake and a far better defensive typing before it Mega Evolves. Mega Steelix's fantastic defensive typing in Steel / Ground gives it a plethora of resistances and two immunities, which let Mega Steelix wall the well-known VoltTurn combination, being immune to Volt Switch and resistant to U-turn. Mega Steelix, however, misses out on the passive recovery that Leftovers would give it. Despite that, Mega Steelix is still a good Pokemon, having access to amazing STAB attacks such as Heavy Slam and Earthquake as well as great utility moves including Stealth Rock and Roar, although it misses out on Thunder Wave, which Mega Aggron gets.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gyro Ball is an option over Heavy Slam due to Mega Steelix's abysmal Speed, but it is generally inferior because it has fewer PP. Stone Edge and Rock Slide are both viable options to hit Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Vaporeon, Suicune, Swampert, and Alomomola take minimal damage from Mega Steelix and threaten it out with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Rapid Spin users such as Mega Blastoise, Forretress, and Donphan can get rid of Stealth Rock and take pitiful damage from Mega Steelix's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-H</strong>: Rotom-H is immune to Earthquake, is 4x resistant to Heavy Slam, and can OHKO Mega Steelix with Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Nidoking and Chandelure are both great examples of special attackers that can OHKO Mega Steelix. They do, however, have trouble switching into it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Mega Steelix's massive Defense stat and great defensive typing, it gets many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock at no cost. Roar is a reliable phazing tool that forces out the opposing Pokemon, racking up Stealth Rock damage on the opponent's team. Dragon Tail is always an option over Roar but is less reliable since Fairy-types are immune to it, it is only 90% accurate, and it does not bypass Substitute or Protect. On the other hand, Toxic can be used to cripple walls such as Vaporeon, Suicune, Swampert, and Alomomola. Heavy Slam is a great option for Mega Steelix, as most of the time it will be at full power due to Mega Steelix's substantial weight, while Earthquake is a more reliable STAB option.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs, 56 Defense EVs, and an Impish nature guarantee that Mega Steelix will survive a Life Orb-boosted Flare Blitz from Jolly Darmanitan while hitting a jump point in Defense. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense, making it easier for Mega Steelix to take special attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>After setting up Stealth Rock, use Mega Steelix's fantastic physical bulk to take hits and retaliate with strong STAB attacks. Use Roar to rack up as much entry hazard damage on the opposing side as possible, weakening the opponent's Pokemon and making it easier for one of yours to clean up late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey, Florges, and Aromatisse are good teammates for Mega Steelix because they form a great defensive core with it and make up for its lack of recovery with Wish. Bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Slowking, and Alomomola provide great synergy with Mega Steelix, as they resist the Fire- and Water-type attacks that often come its way, and Mega Steelix is immune to the Electric-type attacks that could be coming their way; Vaporeon and Alomomola in particular can pass huge Wishes to Mega Steelix. Grass-type Pokemon such as Roserade and Chesnaught can deal with the bulky Water-types that Mega Steelix has a hard time with and can also set up Spikes. Crobat is a good partner for Mega Steelix because it can deal with the Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten Mega Steelix. Spinblockers such as Chandelure and Trevenant are great partners for Mega Steelix because they prevent the success of Rapid Spin.</p>"

  "Granbull": {
    "overview": "<p>Granbull possesses a pure Fairy typing, allowing it to beat many of the tier's Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types. It also has decent Attack and Defense, which, along with Intimidate, make it a solid Pokemon both offensively and defensively. Granbull also has a good movepool, ranging from offensive moves in Earthquake and Play Rough to more supportive ones in Roar and Thunder Wave. However, its low Special Defense makes it vulnerable to many special attackers in the tier, particularly Poison-types such as Nidoqueen and Roserade. It's also very slow and unable to outspeed a number of walls, which sets it back quite a bit. Granbull does require quite a lot of team support and doesn't function well on all types of teams, but it can perform very well as a cleric and a check to many physical threats in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up can be used to boost Granbull's Attack and Defense, but its low Speed and Special Defense render this largely ineffective. Choice Band can be used for Granbull to hit much harder, but its coverage is limited outside of Play Rough and Earthquake. Fire Punch can be used specifically to deal with Forretress, which isn't bothered by any of Granbull's other moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types aren't threatened by Granbull's STAB attacks and can threaten it out with their own STAB attacks. Nidoking and Nidoqueen have a special mention for being immune to Thunder Wave as well.</p> <p><strong>Crobat</strong>: Crobat can switch in on a Play Rough easily and is immune to Earthquake. Paralysis from Thunder Wave can be pain, but Granbull still can't do much when Crobat is paralyzed considering it can just Roost off the damage. Furthermore, Taunt from Crobat completely shuts Granbull down.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Magneton threaten Granbull out with Heavy Slam and Flash Cannon, respectively. Magneton has to be wary of Earthquake, but Mega Aggron isn't too bothered by it nor by Thunder Wave because of its physical bulk and low speed. It's also annoyed by Forretress and Escavalier since the former can freely set up hazards and the latter can threaten any switchin unless Granbull carries Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types can switch into the RestTalk set with ease, but have to watch out for Earthquake from the bulky attacker set. However, airborne Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Moltres are immune to Earthquake and can easily wall Granbull.</p> <p><strong>Hard-hitting Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Shaymin, and Chandelure can all target Granbull's weak Special Defense and either OHKO it or deal major damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Granbull can used as easy setup fodder for Pokemon such as Suicune, Snorlax, and Substitute + Calm Mind Cresselia. Granbull can't deal much damage to these Pokemon and they can shrug off paralysis. The best Granbull can do is phaze them out with Roar if it runs the move.</p> <p><strong>Volt Switch Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Forretress usually switch in easily or, in the case of Heliolisk, threaten Granbull out. They can often use Volt Switch expecting a potential switch, gaining offensive momentum for the opposing team.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is the best STAB move to run on Granbull, being hard hitting and fairly accurate. Heal Bell allows Granbull to cure itself and the rest of its team of status ailments. Earthquake provides good coverage alongside Play Rough to hit Steel- and Fire-types such as Magneton and Entei, which resist Play Rough. Rest can be used as a source of recovery for Granbull, as it is easily worn down. Sleep Talk should be run together with Rest, keeping Granbull useful during the two turns of sleep. There's also the chance of Sleep Talk calling a Heal Bell, waking Granbull up prematurely. If you decide to not run Sleep Talk, Roar is a fine option to phaze opposing Pokemon out, especially those that try to use Granbull as setup fodder. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple Pokemon such as Entei that normally switch in to Granbull expecting a Play Rough.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Impish nature along with maximum EVs invested into HP and Defense maximizes Granbull's defensive capabilities. This is further supported by Intimidate. Leftovers is used to give Granbull a passive form of recovery each turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Granbull can safely switch into many physical attackers such as Mienshao and Conkeldurr, not taking much damage as well as threatening them out with a Play Rough. It also switches well into Pokemon such as Hydreigon due to its pure Fairy typing, so take advantage of these to get a Heal Bell off should you need to. However, you should switch out when dealing with strong special attackers, as they target Granbull's lower Special Defense. Rest should only be used when Granbull is getting to low health, as it makes Granbull semi-vulnerable for two turns. Using Sleep Talk to burn sleep turns should only be done when the opposing Pokemon can't do much damage to Granbull. Using Thunder Wave on predicted switches into faster Pokemon is a good idea to cripple them, as is using Roar to prevent setup by bulkier sweepers. This set is best used on dedicated stall teams as a cleric, while being a solid counter to threats such as Mega Absol, Bulk Up Conkeldurr and Choice Band Heracross.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Granbull is easily worn down, as its only form of recovery is Rest, so entry hazard removal is highly recommended. Donphan is a good partner, as it can not only Rapid Spin away opposing entry hazards, but also has good synergy in helping Granbull deal with Poison- and Steel-types. Ground-types in general such as Nidoking and Krookodile also have good synergy with Granbull. Psychic-type Pokemon such as Espeon make for great partners as well, punishing Poison-types such as Roserade. In return, Granbull can deal with Dark-types that threaten them. Because Granbull is easily worn down, Wish support is appreciated to keep it healthy and make it not too reliant on Rest. This is especially true if you choose to not run Rest. Some good options are Vaporeon, Blissey, and Umbreon, all of which can take the special hits that threaten Granbull.</p>"

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is a solid STAB move, dealing major damage to all Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types in the tier such as Hydreigon, Machamp, Haxorus, and Honchkrow. Heal Bell provides good utility in curing Granbull or its teammates of any status ailments. Earthquake provides good coverage against Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-type Pokemon that resist Play Rough such as Empoleon, Entei, and Nidoqueen. Thunder Wave cripples switch-ins to Granbull, especially faster Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and HP allows Granbull to hit as hard as possible while maintaining sufficient bulk to check Pokemon such as Haxorus and Hydreigon. An Adamant nature is used to boost its good Attack stat further. Granbull's defensive capabilities are supported by Intimidate, making physical attacks hit for much less damage than normal. Leftovers is used for a steady form of passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Granbull easily switches into any Dark-, Fighting-, or Dragon-types and is capable of dealing large amounts of damage back to them. This is particularly true for more defensive Pokemon or physical attackers. Some examples include Umbreon, Mienshao, and Haxorus. Special attackers are the bane of Granbull, putting a major dent in it, so it's always a good idea to switch Granbull out from them. Use Thunder Wave if you manage to predict a switch into a bigger threat, or to simply cripple the foe currently on the battlefield. Granbull should only use Heal Bell when it has a free turn against Pokemon it has a typing advantage against, such as Mienshao.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because this set doesn't carry Rest, it's worn down easily, so entry hazard removal is absolutely needed. Some good partners for the job are Gligar, Donphan, and Forretress, which can set up entry hazards for your team as well. Ground-types partner well with Granbull, as they are able to deal with the Steel- and Poison-types that threaten it. Wish support from Umbreon and Blissey is much appreciated to keep Granbull healthy for as long as possible. They can also take strong special attacks targeted at Granbull. These two can pass Wishes while having Granbull take the Fighting-type attacks that threaten them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>One would think a Pokemon with monstrous defensive stats and horrible attacking stats would never find a place on hyper offense, but Shuckle makes for an excellent lead thanks to its access to Stealth Rock and Sticky Web. Also, because of Shuckle's access to Sturdy, it can run a Mental Herb to negate Taunt once, guaranteeing that it can set up at least one entry hazard. Because of its high defensive stats, it has the bulk to often set both entry hazards. Shuckle also has a great support movepool including access to Encore, Infestation, and Knock Off. Sadly, Shuckle is held back by its extremely low Speed and lack of offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Though Shuckle should only be seriously used to set up Stealth Rock and Sticky Web, it does have a few other options. It can use Accupressure to set up and potentially sweep the opponent's team, but it is incredibly luck-reliant. Also, Power Split can be used to cripple incoming foes by cutting their attacking stats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Espeon, Mega Absol, and Xatu bounce back all of Shuckle's supporting moves and Shuckle can't do much at all to them.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Users of Rapid Spin and Defog such as Blastoise, Tentacruel, Aerodactyl, Crobat, Empoleon, and the occasional Flygon can clear away Shuckle's entry hazards with ease.</p>",

Stealth Rock wears down foes, allowing your Pokemon to score OHKOs and 2HKOs they wouldn't otherwise. Encore locks the foe into the move that they last used, allowing you to easily switch in a Pokemon of your choice, as the foe is either forced to switch out or hit your Pokemon with a weak attack. Toxic is Shuckle's best way of dealing damage and can be used to wear down spinners and Defoggers with the exception of Forretress, Crobat, and Empoleon by spamming Stealth Rock and Sticky Web until Toxic KOes them. Knock Off can be used to remove the foe's item, but it deals very little damage. Finally, Infestation can be used to trap foes and has good synergy with Encore.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs don't really do much for Shuckle, but extra Defense allows Shuckle to take multi-hit moves better, as they are all physical, and allows Shuckle to set up entry hazards against more threats. The combination of Sturdy and a Mental Herb guarantees that Shuckle is able to set up at least one layer of entry hazards, as Sturdy guarantees Shuckle survives one attack and Mental Herb grants a one-time immunity to Taunt or Encore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shuckle is best used as a suicide lead for offensive teams that can take advantage of the lowered Speed of the foes. However, if you can keep Shuckle around for later in the game to switch in and set up switching opportunities using Encore, then that is a good course of action.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong wallbreakers such as Krookidile, Chandelure, Exploud, Lucario, Darmanitan, Machamp, and Heracross make for good partners for their ability to take advantage of Sticky Web and smash holes in the opponent's team. Chandelure gets a special mention for being able to spinblock thanks to its Ghost typing. Also, fast Taunt users such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl make for good partners for their ability to prevent the opponent from Defogging.</p>"

Its two abilities, Guts and Moxie, both let it perform unique roles in the metagame. Moreover, Heracross has usable bulk with a set of resistances that allows it to check certain Pokemon such as Krookodile. Heracross's base Speed allows it to outspeed all relevant walls but leaves it prone to being revenge killed by the plethora of faster offensive Pokemon, especially because it has no usable priority. Additionally, its typing makes makes it difficult to deal with the bulky Fairy- and Flying-types of the UnderUsed tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heracross can use Bulk Up to complement its respectable natural bulk, though Swords Dance is generally the preferred boosting option. Substitute is an option to deter revenge killing and ease prediction, but Heracross must be wary of Infiltrator Crobat. Heracross can run an Endure + Salac Berry set with Reversal and Moxie to act as a late-game sweeper after priority users and faster Choice Scarf Pokemon have been removed. Finally, a RestTalk set with Life Orb can be used to take advantage of Guts and keep Heracross healthy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Crobat can switch into any move other than Stone Edge or a Guts-boosted Facade and easily KO Heracross. Physically defensive Gligar can switch into Choiced variants of Heracross, though it doesn't appreciate having its Eviolite removed by Knock Off and is beaten by Swords Dance variants. Other Flying-types such as Mega Aerodactyl and Fletchinder can revenge kill Heracross as well, but they have more trouble switching in.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Physically defensive Sylveon, Aromatisse and Granbull can switch into Choiced variants of Heracross and KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Most Poison-types resist both of Heracross's STAB moves. Nidoqueen, in particular, can stomach most of Heracross's moves and retaliate with a powerful Sludge Wave, though it is hit hard by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Entei and Mega Beedrill can outspeed Heracross and KO it with their STAB moves.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat and Megahorn are Heracross's two best STAB moves, each with a Base Power of 120. Knock Off hits Flying- and Poison-types neutrally and Ghost-types super effectively, and it also cripples some switch-ins that Heracross cannot immediately handle. Stone Edge hits Flying-types super effectively, although most outspeed Heracross, so it must hit them on the switch. Earthquake hits Poison-types super effectively and certain other Pokemon such as defensive Arcanine more reliably than Stone Edge does. Pursuit can be used to trap Ghost- and Psychic-types and get useful chip damage on Pokemon that frequently switch out of Heracross. Sleep Talk can be used to absorb sleep-inducing moves from Pokemon such as Roserade, and Heracross can proceed to fire off Guts-boosted attacks against unsuspecting foes. Facade also has a niche on Heracross for being able to nail Gligar, Crobat, and Fairy-types when afflicted with a status condition.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band takes advantage of Heracross's enormous power and greatly limits its switch-ins to a select few physically defensive Pokemon. Guts takes advantage of status inflicted by moves such as Toxic and Scald to add even more to Heracross's power and lets Sableye users think twice before they click Will-o-Wisp. Heracross's Attack and Speed are maximized to allow it to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature makes Heracross noticeably more powerful, giving Heracross a chance to 2HKO standard Florges after Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature can be used instead to outspeed certain offensive Pokemon, such as Timid Chandelure and Adamant Lucario. A bulkier spread of 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to better complement Heracross's natural bulk while still outspeeding Adamant Honchkrow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heracross can easily be switched into common users of Scald and Toxic, such as Suicune and Blissey, respectively, to absorb status and get a huge power boost with Guts. Use Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Eviolite from Pokemon such as Sylveon, Florges and Gligar early in the game so that Heracross can break through them more easily later in the battle. Predict switches into Flying- and Poison-types early on and use the appropriate coverage move to allow Heracross to spam its STAB moves easily once they have been removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heracross needs teammates that check Fairy- and Flying-types. As with all offensive Pokemon, entry hazards are essential in order for Heracross to net certain KOs and pressure the opposing team. Mega Aggron and Forretress can switch into many of Heracross's checks and set up Stealth Rock, making them great partners on more balanced teams. Heracross should also be used with faster teammates that appreciate its ability to soften up physical walls. Examples of these are Choice Scarf Infernape and Mega Aerodactyl, both of which can clean up opposing teams once Heracross has broken through bulkier foes. Heracross appreciates VoltTurn support from Pokemon such as Crobat, Mega Ampharos, and the likes, as Heracross loves being to be brought in for free to fire off a powerful attack.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Heracross's Attack to sky-high levels and allows Heracross to dismantle slower teams. Close Combat is Heracross's most powerful and reliable STAB move, KOing many of the tier's Pokemon at +2. Knock Off provides neutral coverage on Poison- and Flying-types and super effective coverage on Ghost-types and also removes Eviolites and Leftovers from defensive targets. Facade can be used over Megahorn in conjunction with Toxic Orb to take advantage of Heracross's ability, Guts, and to hit Fairy- and Poison-types for massive damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment is placed into Attack and Speed to allow Heracross to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature gives Heracross significantly more power and allows it to KO defensive Sylveon with no prior damage and defensive Granbull after Stealth Rock damage with a +2 Guts-boosted Facade. A Jolly nature can be used instead in order for Heracross to outspeed Pokemon such as Timid Chandelure and Adamant Lucario. Guts is the preferred ability for Heracross to take advantage of status moves such as Scald and Toxic, and Heracross is too slow to benefit from Moxie anyway.</p> <p>Leftovers increases Heracross's longevity and allows it to set up more comfortably against certain defensive Pokemon, including Gligar and Vaporeon. Toxic Orb can be used to increase Heracross's immediate power and reliably boost Facade, but it heavily takes away from Heracross's longevity. Toxic Orb variants can opt to run a fourth attacking move over Swords Dance if the immediate power and coverage of both Megahorn and Facade is desired. An alternate EV spread of 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe can be used on the Leftovers variant to set up more easily in the face of passive Pokemon and potentially avoid being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Mienshao. The Speed EVs on this spread allow Heracross to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Heracross's ability to force out Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon to set up easily against slower teams. However, it is fruitless to set up during battles against more offensive teams, as Heracross should simply go for attacks. Heracross's mediocre Speed usually prevents it from sweeping entire teams. Instead, Swords Dance Heracross should be used to break down walls to support its teammates. Use Volt Switch or U-turn support to bring in Heracross and activate its Toxic Orb safely, if running the item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heracross should be paired with Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienshao or Choice Scarf Infernape, which take advantage of Heracross luring in and breaking down physical walls. Teammates that check the Flying- and Fairy-types that often switch into Heracross are necessary, especially for the Leftovers variant.

Stone Edge hits Flying- and Fire-types, such as Crobat and Arcanine, respectively, for super effective damage. Earthquake can be used over Stone Edge for super effective coverage on many Poison-types, such as Nidoqueen, and to serve as a more reliable way to hit Fire-type Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs are placed into Speed with a Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf to allow Heracross to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. 252 EVs in Attack allow Heracross to hit as hard as possible. Moxie is used as Heracross's ability to allow it to accumulate boosts after revenge kills and potentially snowball into a late-game sweeper. Guts can be used instead to allow Heracross to safely switch into moves such as Scald and Toxic and to avoid being completely crippled by burns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Choice Scarf Heracross as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner after the appropriate walls have been weakened or eliminated. Use Knock Off to remove items from defensive walls such as Sylveon, Florges, and Suicune early in the game. If Moxie is the chosen ability, avoid letting Heracross get inflicted by status, as it removes the possibility of sweeping. Alternatively, Heracross with Guts should primarily act as a revenge killer and status absorber instead of a sweeper. Use Close Combat sparingly, especially against Pokemon with Pressure, as its limited PP should be conserved until late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Heracross needs teammates to break down opposing physical walls, especially Fairy-types. Nidoqueen can check many of Heracross's switch-ins and heavily pressure physical walls. Heracross also needs teammates that can handle opposing Choice Scarf users, most of which are faster than Heracross. Spikes support from Pokemon such as Roserade makes it much more difficult for defensive Pokemon to consistently switch into Heracross, especially after their items have been removed with Knock Off.</p>"

  "Houndoom": {
    "overview": "<p>Houndoom has fallen from grace, as the metagame has been unkind to it, especially with the rise of Mega Aerodactyl and Feraligatr, coupled with the prevalence of Hydreigon. However, it doesn't make Houndoom any less of a threat, as it still has an amazing Special Attack stat and a good Speed stat. It also has access to the coveted Nasty Plot, which makes it a very deadly sweeper, while its Mega Evolution's ability Solar Power makes it an amazing wallbreaker in the sun. It has a lot of support options in its arsenal but can't utilize a majority of them. Houndoom also has a unique Dark / Fire typing, which allows it to resist both of Chandelure's STAB types as well as only take neutral damage from Fairy-type attacks in spite of its Dark typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Houndoom has access to Pursuit, which can be used to trap Chandelure, but it doesn't seem to find space to fit it into any set. A Nasty Plot set that uses Flame Charge in the last slot is an option, but it tends to find very few setup opportunities. Super Fang is an option to be able to halve the health of walls that tend to switch into Houndoom, but like Pursuit, it can't seem to fit into any set. Will-O-Wisp is an option to cripple physical attackers, primarily Mega Aerodactyl, that tend to switch into Houndoom. Sludge Bomb can be used in the fourth slot of the Nasty Plot set, but a neutral Fire Blast does just as much damage as a super effective Sludge Bomb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax can easily take any boosted hit from Houndoom, and can stall out Sunny Day variants.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Priority</strong>: Fighting-type priority moves, such as Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch, can KO Houndoom before it can do anything.</p> <p><strong>Hydreigon</strong>: Hydreigon can always beat Houndoom one-on-one as well as switch into most of its moves easily.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users, such as Mienshao and Infernape, outspeed Houndoom and can easily KO with a STAB move. Pokemon that naturally outspeed Houndoom, such as Mega Beedrill and Crobat, also fit in this category.</p> <p><strong>Mega Aerodactyl</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Houndoom, can switch in on any neutral hit or support move, and OHKOes it with Stone Edge.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Houndoom's Special Attack by two stages, making it a deadly sweeper. Fire Blast hits hard, especially after a Flash Fire boost, but has a chance to miss. Flamethrower doesn't have a miss chance but instead lacks the raw power of Fire Blast, causing it to miss out on crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as an OHKO on Kyurem after one layer of Spikes and a 2HKO on Florges after factoring in Protect. Dark Pulse is a very consistent secondary STAB move that also has a chance to cause the foe to flinch. Taunt gives Houndoom a means to beat Pokemon that use status to cripple Houndoom, such as Thunder Wave Porygon2 and Toxic Alomomola. Protect is used so that Houndoom can get the speed boost from Mega Evolving without taking any damage, and also lets it scout Choice Scarf users, which are commonly used to revenge kill Mega Houndoom. Destiny Bond allows Houndoom to take down the opposing Pokemon upon being KOed. Hidden Power Grass is an option if the team has problems against Seismitoad, Swampert, or Rhyperior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs are used to augment Houndoom's sweeping potential. The leftover 4 EVs are put into Special Defense to ensure Download Porygon2 and Porygon-Z don't get a Special Attack boost from switching in on Mega Houndoom. Should Taunt be chosen as the move for the fourth slot, an EV spread of 40 HP / 216 SpA / 252 Spe should be used instead, as it allows Houndoom to survive three Seismic Tosses from Blissey. Flash Fire allows Houndoom to gain a damage boost to its Fire-type attacks as well as gain a Fire-type immunity prior to Mega Evolving. A Timid nature is used to ensure Houndoom can outspeed threats quicker than positive-natured base 100s after Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Houndoom shouldn't try to set up Nasty Plot early-game, as most of its checks and counters would still be healthy then. Houndoom should instead try to weaken its defensive checks that lack reliable recovery, namely Swampert and Rhyperior. Houndoom should always attempt to get a Flash Fire boost prior to Mega Evolving, as it makes Houndoom much more threatening. Mega Houndoom should also take advantage of Knock Off as an opportunity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Houndoom appreciates VoltTurn partners to be able to have a free switch; Rotom-C does this role exceptionally well due to its ability to take Ground- and Water-type attacks aimed at Houndoom while Houndoom is able to take Fire-type attacks aimed at Rotom-C. Shaymin is another exceptional Houndoom partner, as it not only serves as a wallbreaker but also has access to the coveted Healing Wish, which allows you to have another chance of sweeping with Houndoom should it get weakened during the first attempt. Houndoom is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, making entry hazard removal a necessity. Entry hazard removers such as Crobat and Tentacruel fill this role exceptionally well. Entry hazard setters such as Froslass and Diancie also make for great teammates, as Houndoom has a much easier time sweeping with entry hazards on the foes' side of the field. Forretress is an outstanding Houndoom teammate, as it fulfills the role of Rapid Spinner, entry hazard setter, and Volt Switch user all at the same time. Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Heracross and Choice Band Conkeldurr, make for good teammates, as they weaken walls and allow Houndoom to sweep more easily. Houndoom lures in special walls, such as Snorlax and Blissey; Pokemon that can take advantage of this, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance Lucario, make for good partners.</p>"
      },
      "SunnyDoom": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sunny Day activates Mega Houndoom's Solar Power, making it a dangerous wallbreaker. Fire Blast is Houndoom's go-to wallbreaking move, sporting a 371 Base Power after accounting for Solar Power, sun, and STAB. Dark Pulse is the most consistent special Dark-type move, making it ideal for use on Houndoom. Solar Beam allows Houndoom to hit Water-types, such as Seismitoad and Suicune, as well as Rock-types, namely Rhyperior, for super effective damage and doesn't require a charge turn in the sun.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs are put into both Speed and Special Attack to maximize Houndoom's wallbreaking ability. The four remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to ensure Download Porygon2 and Porygon-Z don't get a Special Attack boost against Mega Houndoom. A Timid nature is used to ensure Houndoom can outspeed everything up to +1 Adamant Tyrantrum and positive-natured Tornadus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Houndoom should always attempt to gain a Flash Fire boost, as it makes Fire Blast go from powerful to deadly in the sun. Houndoom can easily use Knock Off as an opportunity to switch in after Mega Evolving. Houndoom should try to wallbreak early-game, as it softens up most of its defensive checks easily and dents a lot of defensive cores.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Houndoom's wallbreaking ability is appreciated by wallbreakers, cleaners, and sweepers alike. Respective examples of all three are Choice Specs Sylveon, Mega Sharpedo, and Nasty Plot Lucario. Wallbreakers appreciate it because wallbreaking cores can dismantle defensive teams with ease. Cleaners and sweepers appreciate it because it makes their job that much easier. Sun sweepers, such as Solar Power Heliolisk and Chlorophyll Shiftry, make for good teammates, as they can take advantage of the sun Houndoom sets. Houndoom doesn't have the best bulk, so switching in on hits is hard at times. VoltTurn partners mitigate this problem, making them good teammates for Houndoom. Rotom-C is an exceptionally good VoltTurn partner due to its ability to form a wallbreaking core with Houndoom while also resisting Ground- and Water-type moves aimed at Houndoom. Defog users and Rapid Spin users, such as Gligar and Mega Blastoise, make for great Houndoom partners because Houndoom is easily worn down by entry hazards. Houndoom can wallbreak much more easily after entry hazards have been set, making entry hazard setters, such as Roserade and Chesnaught, good teammates. Forretress and Mega Aerodactyl are exceptionally good Houndoom teammates, as they can both remove and set entry hazards. Pokemon that can take advantage of the fact that Houndoom lures in special walls, such as Mienshao and Conkeldurr, make for good teammates.</p>"

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kingdra's various ways to set up its offenses make it a fearsome sweeper in the UU tier. It possesses both Sniper and Focus Energy, allowing it to always land a Sniper-boosted critical hit. Despite its initial lackluster Speed, Kingdra has two reliable ways to boost its Speed in Swift Swim and Agility. Water and Dragon make for an unresisted STAB combination, with the exception of Empoleon and Whimsicott. Kingdra possesses equally usable Attack and Special Attack, along with a great defensive typing and decent bulk, making it very well-rounded. However, Kingdra is prone to being revenge killed by Dragon-type Choice Scarf users due to its weakness to Dragon-type moves and its average Speed. Said average Speed can also make it difficult for Kingdra to set up a Focus Energy, Dragon Dance, or Rain Dance. Most importantly, Fairy-types make Kingdra's Dragon-type attacks unreliable in some cases. Nonetheless, Kingdra's unpredictability makes it worthy of a spot on many offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs makes Kingdra a powerful wallbreaker, but you must have rain on the field in order for it to work effectively. Iron Head hits Florges harder than Waterfall does and prevents it from being a reliable switch-in to an unboosted Kingdra. ChestoRest can provide one-time reliable recovery for the Dragon Dance set, but Kingdra the lacks room for the move and the item. Leftovers is an option for the Swift Swim set in order to keep Kingdra healthy enough to use Rain Dance, but it prefers the power boost from Life Orb. Damp Rock can maximize the duration of Rain Dance, but Kingdra will not ususally be around for long enough to take advantage of it. Waterfall can be used outside of the Dragon Dance set in order to hit Blissey, but it requires significant Attack investment in order to be effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Empoleon</strong>: Empoleon can absorb any of Kingdra's attacks and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Florges</strong>: Though Florges cannot always switch into Kingdra, it can tank any attack (even Iron Head), physical or special, from a Kingdra that has not yet set up, and 2HKO it with STAB Moonblast. However, Hydro Pump critical hits cleanly 2HKO Florges so it must beware of switching into a full-health Kingdra as it uses Focus Energy.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Most Choice Scarf users will outspeed Kingdra at +1, most notably Hydreigon, Haxorus, and Mienshao. All three aforementioned Choice Scarf users can OHKO Kingdra before it even attempts to set up. However, Rain Dance Kingdra outspeeds and OHKOes all of them so it is important to first scout its set.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Most dedicated special walls, such as Blissey and Umbreon, can take even a rain-boosted Hydro Pump. With a combination of Wish and Protect they can easily stall out Hydro Pump's measly 8 PP, or cripple Kingdra with status.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Critdra": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Energy is Kingdra's setup move, raising its critical hit rate to 50%. Draco Meteor is a very strong STAB attack, and critical hits will ignore the Special Attack drop from using it. Hydro Pump can hit Fairy- and Steel-types such as Florges and Mega Aggron that Draco Meteor cannot do much damage to. Agility is the best option for the fourth slot, as it can make Kingdra difficult to revenge kill, possibly allowing it to set up for a complete sweep of the opposing team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment maximizes Kingdra's offensive presence. Modest is the preferred nature to prevent dedicated special walls such as Umbreon from PP stalling Kingdra, which is important because Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump have a very low PP count of just 8. Alternatively, a Timid nature can be used to Speed tie with Nidoking and opposing Kingdra, but the ability to stallbreak is typically preferred. Sniper raises the damage output of Kingdra's critical hits from 1.5x to 2.25x, while Scope Lens raises Kingdra's critical hit rate one stage. In combination with Focus Energy, Kingdra is guaranteed to land a critical hit on every attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not set up a Focus Energy on offensive Pokemon that hit Kingdra at least neutrally. It may have a good defensive typing and decent bulk, but it typically wants to avoid offensive pressure. Before using Focus Energy, Kingdra's damage output will be marginal with its modest base 95 Special Attack, so be sure to boost against a defensive Pokemon as soon as possible. If the opponent packs a faster Pokemon or a Choice Scarf user, particularly a Dragon-type one, either use Agility right away or keep Kingdra off of the battlefield until the faster Pokemon has been taken down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel- or Fire-types such as Metagross and Entei can force out the Fairy-types that threaten Kingdra. Likewise, a Fairy-type such as Florges or Sylveon will scare away the Dragon-types that Kingdra cannot set up on, particularly Hydreigon, Haxorus, and Kyurem.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Kingdra's Attack and Speed to high levels. Waterfall is Kingdra's most reliable STAB attack because of its good neutral coverage and its ability to occasionally flinch the foe. Outrage is mainly used for late-game cleaning after the opponent has lost all of their Fairy- and Steel-types. Substitute has many uses on a sweeping set, but is primarily used to allow Kingdra to gain a free Dragon Dance, and to protect it from status moves from Pokemon such as Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Kingdra needs its Attack and Speed maximized in order to deal damage heavily and quickly. At +1, Kingdra outspeeds Jolly Mega Aerodactyl and Speed ties with Choice Scarf Nidoking. Lum Berry prevents a Scald-induced burn from crippling Kingdra, and it will heal self-inflicted confusion from Outrage once. Sniper is the preferred ability because Kingdra is probably not going to be used on a rain team here, limiting Swift Swim's use to solely allowing it to check offensive Mega Swampert.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When in doubt, scout the foe's moves with Substitute, but it's not always the best idea to boost directly after getting a Substitute up. If the opponent has a faster Choice Scarf user, or your current foe is a slower Pokemon that you can KO, attack instead of using Dragon Dance. This set is a late-game cleaner and not a bulky wallbreaker, so wait until the opposing Fairy- and Steel-types have been weakened before spamming Outrage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sticky Web support from Galvantula or Shuckle will allow Kingdra to beat most Choice Scarf users at +1, such as Darmanitan. A special setup sweeper such as Suicune will deal with the physical walls that Kingdra lures in, such as Forretress. A Steel-type such as Mega Aggron can tank the Dragon- and Fairy- type attacks that Kingdra normally cannot survive. Nidoqueen and Entei can make for good offensive partners to weaken opposing Fairy- and Steel-types to aid in Kingdra's sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance is a pseudo-Agility, doubling Kingdra's Speed with Swift Swim. Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB attack that is extremely powerful in the rain. Draco Meteor is a secondary STAB move that hits the bulky Water-types that can tank a Hydro Pump. Surf is a slightly less powerful but perfectly accurate Water-type STAB attack, while Dragon Pulse OHKOes the Dragon-types of UU, such as Haxorus and Hydreigon. Alternatively, Ice Beam hits Grass-types in addition to Dragon-types, but unlike Dragon Pulse, the move fails to OHKO Dragon-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Modest nature allow Kingdra to outspeed Choice Scarf Infernape while maximizing Kingdra's offensive power in the process. Swift Swim is a must-have in order to make use of rain, as it will double Kingdra's Speed when rain is active. Life Orb is the preferred item to allow Kingdra to dish out as much damage as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keeping Kingdra healthy is very important, as it needs a turn to set up Rain Dance before it starts attacking. Avoid setting up Rain Dance on an offensive Pokemon, or simply KO said Pokemon if it is weakened enough and slower. As this set will often be coming in on weakened Pokemon, it creates several 50/50 situations, as you must choose whether to KO the foe right there, or to predict its switch and set up a Rain Dance. Moreover, this set cannot wallbreak, so it is relegated to the role of late-game cleaner.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is highly vulnerable to bulky Water-types, particularly Suicune. A Grass- or Electric-type such as Shaymin or Mega Ampharos, respectively, can force out the Water-types that Kingdra may lure in. Florges gives this set trouble, so a Pokemon that can set up on her such as Cobalion works as an alternative win condition. This set fits very well on dedicated rain teams, so you can pair Kingdra with rain staples such as Tornadus, Toxicroak, and Mega Swampert.</p>"

  "Donphan": {
    "overview": "<p>Donphan's good Attack and Defense stats make it a nice bulky attacker as well as decent physical tank. It also has access to the coveted Rapid Spin, which makes it the only Rapid Spin user in the tier immune to Electric-type attacks. Its typing gives it a nice Electric-type immunity as well as resistances to Poison and Rock but weaknesses to Ice, Water, and Grass, which are common attacking types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge and Poison Jab are options but are generally less useful than the listed moves. Stone Edge only really allows for a clean OHKO on Crobat, and Poison Jab, being much weaker than Gunk Shot, misses out on crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs such as the 2HKO on Chesnaught. Sleep Talk is also an option but is generally a waste of a moveslot. Head Smash can be used to get an extremely hard hit off on a foe but its recoil as well as the superior coverage given by the other options outweigh the usefulness of the move. A Rock Polish set can be used, but Donphan is far too slow to utilize it well. Ice Shard is an option on the defensive spinner set but tends to be far too weak to be of much use. Counter is another option on the defensive spinner set but tends to only get one use, which makes it a waste of a moveslot most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water- and Grass-types</strong>: All Water- and Grass-types counter Donphan's defensive spinner set and check the Choice Band variant.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types only check Donphan, as they have to be wary of the rare Stone Edge. Also, most Ice-types lack significant bulk, so they can be KOed by a neutral hit.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Froslass can prevent defensive Donphan from setting up Stealth Rock and phazing them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulky setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Krookodile, CroCune, Swords Dance Mega Abomasnow and Curse Snorlax can all set up on both defensive and offensive spinner sets as well as set up on Choice Band Donphan, depending on the move Donphan locks itself into.</p>",

      "Defensive Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is the most reliable STAB attack for any physically offensive Ground-type and provides a whopping 100 Base Power and consistent damage output. Rapid Spin allows Donphan to remove entry hazards on it's side of the field. Stealth Rock allows Donphan to set up its own entry hazards and wear down opposing Pokemon each time they switch in. The last slot can be used for one of three possible moves. The first is Knock Off, as it allows Donphan to cripple the opposing Pokemon by removing its item. The second is Toxic, as it allows Donphan to cripple any defensive switch-in that isn't immune to Poison-type moves. The last is Roar, which allows Donphan to phaze and gives it a way to make sure it isn't setup fodder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense and HP EVs with an Impish nature allow Donphan to have as much physical bulk as it can muster, and Sturdy allows for Donphan to survive any one hit and either retaliate with Earthquake or Knock Off, cripple it with Toxic, set up hazards with Stealth Rock, or remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Leftovers is the item of the set as it gives Donphan passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send Donphan in against Pokemon that it can check to an extent, such as Toxicroak, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Beedrill. This set's main purpose is to remove entry hazards while being a nice defensive presence, so use it to remove hazards whenever it is in a fairly decent matchup against the opposing Pokemon. If Donphan's Sturdy is needed to check a threat on the opposing team, try to make sure it is intact for as long as possible until it isn't needed anymore. Donphan, despite its good Defense stat, must be wary when switching into hard-hitting physical attackers such as Heracross and Darmanitan.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Donphan lacks a form of solid recovery besides Rest, so it appreciates Wish-passing partners that can act as special walls, such as Blissey and Florges. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon make for good partners, as they can tank Water- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Donphan; however, they do share a Grass-type weakness, so be sure to pack a Pokemon that resists Grass when pairing Donphan with a bulky Water-type. Crobat has excellent synergy with Donphan, as Donphan can tank Electric- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Crobat and Crobat has a 4x resistance to Grass and can take hard-hitting Fighting-type attacks aimed at Donphan, such as Machamp's Close Combat. Grass-types such as Roserade and Chesnaught make for good teammates for Donphan as well, as they resist Water-type and Grass-type moves aimed at Donphan. Pokemon that have a weakness to Stealth Rock, such as Darmanitan and Beedrill, would also appreciate being on the same team as Donphan, as it can remove entry hazards for them.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Donphan's most reliable STAB attack and hits incredibly hard with Choice Band. Ice Shard is Donphan's only form of priority and provides pretty good coverage. Knock Off allows Donphan to cripple switch-ins as well as hit Pokemon such as Bronzong and Cresselia super effectively. Gunk Shot gives Donphan a stronger super effective move against Grass-types, punishing the majority that switch in as well as allowing it to OHKO Florges and Aromatisse. Seed Bomb gets a mention on the last slot, as it allows Donphan to OHKO Swampert and get crucial 2HKOs on bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Alomomola after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>204 Speed EVs allow Donphan to outspeed everything up to uninvested base 75 Speed Pokemon such as Florges. Choice Band gives Donphan the Attack boost necessary for it to support its teammates by breaking through walls it such as Suicune, Alomomola, and Chesnaught. Sturdy is the ability of choice because it lets Donphan survive a hit from full health and because Sand Veil is extremely luck-based and should not be used. An alternative EV spread of 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe can be used to give Donphan more bulk while still outspeeding base 65 Speed Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Umbreon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Send Donphan in on anything it would normally wall to an extent, such as Toxicroak. Look at what the opponent would switch into, and attack accordingly. You can also send Donphan in on walls it can deal with, such as Florges, and take them out of the picture. Try to ensure Sturdy is kept intact as much as possible through Wish support, as Sturdy is needed to let Donphan survive hits from sweepers that have already set up. It also helps Donphan deal with Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin, as Donphan can survive a hit and either KO or hit hard enough so that a teammate can revenge kill them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers that appreciate the removal or weakening of walls that Donphan can lure in make for good partners, so consider using Lucario, Dragon Dance Haxorus, or Swords Dance Mega Absol. Wish passers and clerics such as Florges and Vaporeon make for good partners as well since they can remove status from Donphan and heal it back with Wish. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Mega Ampharos and Hydreigon make for good partners as they can safely bring Donphan in. Grass-types such as Roserade and Mega Sceptile can beat bulky Water-types, Donphan's best checks, so they are good teammates. Dark-types such as Krookodile and Mega Sharpedo also are good partners for Donphan as they help beat its hardest counter, Cresselia.</p>"

Knock Off is a nice move with the ability to remove the foe's item. Ice Shard allows Donphan to have some sort of priority but is very weak, so don't rely on it to KO the opposing Pokemon unless the opposing Pokemon is either very frail or weak to Ice. Stealth Rock lets Donphan set up its own entry hazard but should not be used should you choose to run Assault Vest, as it makes Donphan incapable of using this move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature allow Donphan to hit as hard as possible. 84 Speed EVs allow Donphan to outspeed neutral-natured base 60 Speed Pokemon and anything slower. The remaining 172 EVs are put into HP to give Donphan as much bulk as possible. Leftovers gives Donphan a form of recovery and allows Donphan to use support moves, whereas Assault Vest gives Donphan more special bulk, allowing it to check some special threats such as Mega Ampharos and Rotom-H variants lacking Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Donphan set should be sent in on anything that it can check well, especially Choice-locked Electric-types such as Choice Scarf Rotom-H. Try to ensure Donphan is as healthy as possible at all times should you have teammates that require entry hazard removal. Donphan can take out most, if not all, Rapid Spin blockers with Earthquake, Knock Off, Ice Shard, or even a combination of the three, so correct predictions are key to Donphan doing its job successfully.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Donphan appreciates Wish and cleric support, so Florges and Vaporeon make for good partners. In general, Pokemon that appreciate Donphan's ability to remove entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, make for good partners, although Fire-types and Flying-types get special mentions. Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Entei don't have access to reliable recovery and can threaten Grass-types, which would otherwise scare Donphan out. Flying-types are also able to deal with a majority of Grass-types and have having good synergy with Donphan; Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat fit this category nicely.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 has an amazing defensive ability in Trace, allowing it to use the foe's ability against it. It has great 85 / 90 / 95 bulk that is further augmented by Eviolite. Using Eviolite is a double-edged sword, however, as it means that Porygon2 lacks the passive recovery of Leftovers. It also lacks strong bulk without its Eviolite, meaning that it is severely crippled by losing it via Knock Off. Regardless, Porygon2 has access to a decent STAB move in Tri Attack and decent coverage options such as Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has a great support movepool, with access to Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Recover, a reliable recovery move that allows Porygon2 to stay healthy throughout the match. Porygon2's typing is decent defensively due to only having one weakness, albeit a common one, but it isn't amazing due to its lack of resistances, only being immune to Ghost. Porygon2 is also very susceptible to status ailments and is setup fodder for bulky sweepers such as Snorlax, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Suicune.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire gives Porygon2 the ability to hit Forretress, Cobalion, Doublade, and Lucario harder than it can with its common coverage moves. Sadly, Cobalion, Doublade, and Lucario can set up on Porygon2, while Forretress can stack entry hazards against it. Psych Up gives Porygon2 a way to compete with Calm Mind sweepers that typically set up on it such as Suicune and Reuniclus; however, both of them have ways of beating Porygon2 anyway, with Roar in Suicune's case and Psyshock in Reuniclus's case. Porygon2 is already hard pressed for moveslots as well. Discharge gives Porygon2 a way to spread paralysis while retaining coverage on Empoleon and Feraligatr; however, Porygon2 is better off having a guaranteed chance at hindering them with Thunder Wave and then switching out. Magic Coat allows Porygon2 to bounce back Taunt and status moves that tend to cripple it. Again, though, Porygon2 suffers from four-moveslot syndrome and thus has a hard time finding a place to fit Magic Coat in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Heracross and Lucario can threaten Porygon2 with their super effective STAB moves. They also threaten a lot of Porygon2's common partners with their nearly impeccable coverage. Fighting-types also tend to carry Knock Off, which can further cripple Porygon2's bulk by removing its Eviolite.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick Users</strong>: Porygon2 hates losing its Eviolite and being locked into a move after being Tricked a Choice Scarf or Choice Band.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Snorlax, Reuniclus, and Suicune can all set up on Porygon2 with ease, causing Porygon2 to be a momentum killer against these particular Pokemon. Reuniclus and Suicune both hate being paralyzed by the defensive set, though.</p> <p><strong>Status Inducers</strong>: Status ailments really cripple Porygon2, as it has no way to get rid of them itself and gets worn down easily.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Crobat, Jellicent, and Hydreigon can force Porygon2 to not use Recover or Trick Room and whittle it down with their STAB moves.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Recover gives Porygon2 a reliable form of recovery to continue tanking hits. Tri Attack is an amazing STAB move, allowing Porygon2 to have a 20% chance to burn, paralyze, or freeze its foe. Ice Beam gives Porygon2 decent coverage alongside its STAB move, hitting Hydreigon harder as well as Pokemon that resist Normal such as Mega Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum. Thunder Wave allows Porygon2 to hinder more offensive teams, while Toxic allows Porygon2 to wear down more defensive teams. Foul Play is an option to have an easier time against physical attackers, especially those that use setup moves, such as Swords Dance Doublade and Swords Dance Abomasnow. Thunderbolt hits Feraligatr harder than Tri Attack, as well as hitting Empoleon and retaining super effective coverage on Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs allow Porygon2 to have the greatest mixed bulk it can have, taking on Mega Sceptile and Mega Houndoom while also being able to check physical attackers such as Feraligatr. A Calm nature allows Porygon2 to better check special attackers. Eviolite further augments Porygon2's bulk, allowing it to repeatedly tank hits throughout the match. Trace gives Porygon2 the ability to check defensive and offensive Pokemon alike. Tracing great abilities such as Flash Fire and Intimidate allows Porygon2 to have both offensive and defensive presence when checking the Pokemon it needs to wall. A specific EV spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 SpD with a Bold nature allows Porygon2 to tank physical hits better while still retaining a good bit of special bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Porygon2 is used as a great blanket check to many threats such as Hydreigon and Feraligatr. However, don't overestimate its bulk or pressure it too much, as it can only take so much damage before being worn down. Porygon2 must watch out for potential Knock Off users such as Gligar and Mandibuzz, as they can get rid of its Eviolite and compromise its bulk. Scout for moves that can shut down or 2HKO Porygon2 on Pokemon it normally walls, such as Taunt on Hydreigon and Focus Blast on Nidoqueen. Recover should be used often, as Porygon2 will usually move last. Porygon2 is a great pivot for moderately powerful attacks. Thunder Wave is all it can do to cripple slow setup sweepers such as Reuniclus, which can easily set up on Toxic variants of Porygon2.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that threaten Fighting-types as well as hit them super effectively, such as Sylveon, Florges and Crobat, are great partners; Sylveon and Florges can also get rid of status, which really cripples Porygon2. Entry hazard removers such as Forretress, Gligar, Tentacruel, and Crobat help keep Porygon2 alive, as entry hazards wear it down very quickly. Forretress can keep up momentum as well, while Gligar and Crobat can hit very hard. Gligar in particular has amazing defensive synergy with Porygon2, although both fear Knock Off from common Fighting-types. Grounded Poison-types such as Nidoqueen can absorb Toxic Spikes, which Porygon2 really hates. Nidoqueen also appreciates Porygon2's ability to slow down a lot of faster threats with Thunder Wave. Entry hazard support from Forretress, Qwilfish, or Nidoqueen helps Porygon2 wear down the opponent's team passively, as it can force a lot of switches thanks to its threatening status moves.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Porygon2 to go first with its below average base 60 Speed. Recover gives Porygon2 a reliable form of recovery. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam allow Porygon2 to have near-perfect coverage, hitting everything in the tier for at least neutral damage bar Thick Fat Mamoswine. Thunderbolt hits bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Feraligatr, while Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Flying-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Aerodactyl. Tri Attack is a decent STAB option that allows Porygon2 to spread status ailments and hit neutral targets hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Quiet nature with a 0 Speed IV ensures that Porygon2 outspeeds as many Pokemon as possible under Trick Room. Download allows Porygon2 to possibly get a Special Attack boost and thus hit harder. Maximum HP and Special Attack EVs allow Porygon2 to tank as many hits as possible while hitting as hard as it can. Eviolite gives Porygon2 as much bulk as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to keep Porygon2 healthy so that it can continue to set up Trick Room throughout the match. Porygon2 must watch out for potential Knock Off users such as Gligar and Mandibuzz, as they can get rid of its Eviolite and compromise its bulk. Taunt users give Porygon2 a hard time, preventing it from using Recover and Trick Room. This set can set up Trick Room not only for itself but also for slow setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Slowking and Swords Dance Doublade so that they can get around faster checks. This set should only be used on dedicated Trick Room teams, as Trick Room only has four turns to be utilized (three if Porygon2 switches out), so it can drain momentum from any team not dedicated to Trick Room.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that benefit from Trick Room, such as Pangoro, Mega Camerupt, Escavalier, Hoopa, Machamp, Slowking, Reuniclus, and Mega Ampharos, can hit hard and outspeed most Pokemon under Trick Room. Secondary Trick Room setters such as Chandelure, Cresselia, Slowking, and Aromatisse are really helpful in keeping Trick Room up. Aromatisse has the added benefit of keeping Porygon2 healthy thanks to Aromatherapy and Wish. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress is extremely helpful, as it helps wear down the opponent's team. Forretress also can spin away entry hazards, allowing Porygon2 to keep setting up Trick Room throughout the match.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle fills a unique niche in the UU metagame as an entry hazard lead with access to sleep-inducing moves. It gets access to almost every move in the game, but subpar offensive stats relegate it to using passive moves. This isn't necessarily bad, however, as Smeargle makes for a great support Pokemon that can beat most other leads if you play it right. Smeargle faces some competition as a Sticky Web user from Shuckle, which has more bulk and has room to use a Mental Herb to dodge Taunt for one turn. However, Smeargle's higher Speed and access to Spore, Taunt, and Magic Coat are enough to differentiate itself from its competition and carve a decent niche for itself. Still, though its base 75 Speed isn't bad by any means, it causes Smeargle to get outsped by common offensive Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Infernape, and Mega Aerodactyl, which can limit Smeargle to setting up only one entry hazard because of its terrible defenses. Additionally, Smeargle is vulnerable to Taunt due to its passive nature, though Magic Coat mitigates this somewhat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Smeargle has a plethora of other options due to it learning almost every move in the game. Toxic Spikes can be used in the third slot on the main set if you feel as though your team needs it. Explosion makes Smeargle go out with a boom, which gives its team momentum and chip damage as well as blocking Defog and Rapid Spin for one turn. A combination of Endeavor and Extreme Speed can be used to KO leads or can even be saved for later in a match to act as a check to setup sweepers if entry hazards are kept off of Smeargle's side of the field. Trick Room is a cool option for teams with slow and powerful Pokemon. Overheat can 2HKO Forretress, but it doesn't have much use outside of that. Rapid Spin could be used to remove entry hazards that are set up against Smeargle. If Smeargle has already done its job, Memento can provide a setup opportunity for a teammate, although Smeargle's low Speed means that it usually won't be able to pull it off. Mental Herb blocks Taunt from Pokemon such as Infernape and Mega Aerodactyl, though this compromises Smeargle's Focus Sash and it already gets access to Magic Coat. Whirlwind allows Smeargle to phaze Pokemon that get cheeky and try to use Smeargle as setup bait. Nuzzle allows Smeargle to paralyze and slow down faster Pokemon for its teammates, though it conflicts with Spore a little bit.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Espeon and Mega Absol can bounce all of Smeargle's moves back at it, rendering it completely useless.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon that carry Taunt such as Infernape, Mega Aerodactyl, and Crobat can completely shut down Smeargle if it is not running Magic Coat and do anything they want from there.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Once Smeargle has fainted, spinners such as Mega Blastoise and Defoggers such as Crobat and Empoleon can remove entry hazards from the field, although spinners need to be wary of Ghost-types.</p> <p><strong>Non-Sucker Punch Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon that carry priority moves that aren't Sucker Punch, such as Abomasnow, Arcanine, Infernape, Lucario, and Mamoswine, can pick off Smeargle and limit it to only setting up one entry hazard.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Roserade, Hydreigon, and Cobalion can outspeed Smeargle and limit it to setting up one entry hazard. Roserade in particular can actually prevent Smeargle from setting any entry hazards up with Sleep Powder and proceed to 2HKO with Giga Drain, though Sleep Powder's accuracy is something to watch out for.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is useful to put opposing Pokemon to sleep, giving Smeargle more time to set up entry hazards. Dark Void can be used instead if you're worried about Grass-types such as Mega Abomasnow and Chesnaught or Overcoat users such as Mandibuzz and Escavalier, though the accuracy is off-putting. Stealth Rock secures KOs for offensive Pokemon and also gets residual damage on Flying-types and Levitate users, which can avoid other entry hazards. Sticky Web lowers the Speed of opposing grounded Pokemon, giving slower offensive Pokemon such as Chandelure and Hydreigon a chance to shine. Spikes is an option if you're not running a team centered around Sticky Web, as it gets more residual damage. Taunt is almost mandatory so that Smeargle can shut down Defoggers and not lose the entry hazards that it has worked hard to set up. Alternatively, Magic Coat can be used to reflect opposing entry hazards as well as Taunt, though forgoing Taunt causes Smeargle to get manhandled by Defoggers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed and a Timid nature are used to make Smeargle as speedy as possible. The rest of the EVs go into its HP, allowing it to take a few hits. Own Tempo is Smeargle's only usable ability. Focus Sash almost guarantees that Smeargle will set up an entry hazard and is pretty much mandatory because of its terrible defenses.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Smeargle should only be used on hyper offensive builds, as other team archetypes would generally prefer an entry hazard setter with more staying power. Smeargle is best used as a suicide lead to ensure that its Focus Sash will remain intact. When using Smeargle, you should aim to put the foe to sleep first and then set up the entry hazard that benefits you the most in that situation. Be sure to use Taunt if you predict a switch to a Defogger that is faster than Smeargle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Taunt users such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl are highly recommended to help prevent Smeargle's entry hazards from being removed by Defog. Likewise, U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Hydreigon, Moltres, Mega Beedrill, and Cobalion can pivot into said Taunt users if needed, though a bit of prediction is required on the player's part. Wallbreakers such as Hydreigon, Haxorus, Entei, Nidoking, Heracross, and Chandelure appreciate the entry hazards that Smeargle provides, as it helps them net key OHKOs and 2HKOs and outrun faster threats. Likewise, sweepers such as Feraligatr, Cobalion, and Venomoth also like being able to get some KOs they wouldn't normally get, as do cleaners such as Sharpedo, Yanmega, Mega Beedrill, and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Pokemon with the ability Defiant, such as Tornadus and Braviary, can switch into and take advantage of opposing Defog users, which is a great help for Sticky Web and other hazard-stacking teams. Smeargle should be paired with Pokemon that can switch into and threaten Pokemon looking to remove Smeargle's entry hazards; for example, Toxicroak can switch into and start setting up on Empoleon, while Tyrantrum and Mega Aerodactyl can take care of Crobat. Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Doublade also make for excellent teammates, as they are able to spinblock.</p>"

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey's astronomical HP and Special Defense make it the premier special wall of UU. In addition, Blissey has access to a plethora of support moves, such as Wish and Heal Bell, allowing it to aid its team by providing cleric support and tanking all special hits. Its Normal typing gives it only one weakness, and Natural Cure allows it to absorb status effects. In combination, these two traits make Blissey difficult to wear down. Access to Seismic Toss and Toxic are all Blissey needs to not be setup bait. However, even with those options of dealing damage, Blissey is still pretty passive. It also struggles against Pokemon that rely on Substitute, as Seismic Toss does not break a Substitute of a Pokemon with 404 HP or more, and status moves, such as Toxic, do not hit through Substitute. As Seismic Toss is Blissey's only direct attacking option, it is very vulnerable to Taunt and will often find itself doing little for the team if affected by it. Though the Normal-type has only one weakness, it's a very common one in UU, with physical Fighting-type attackers such as Mienshao and Infernape running rampant in the tier. Blissey also suffers a bit from four-moveslot syndrome, as it really wishes it had access to all its support moves. Even so, Blissey is still one of the best walls in the UU tier and finds a home on many defensively minded teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blissey has a wide range of coverage moves including Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, and Grass Knot, which can be used to surprise certain Pokemon such as Gyarados and Mega Swampert. However, Seismic Toss is usually the better option as it provides more consistent damage. Counter can net a surprise KO against physical attackers, but Blissey won't always survive an attack from one, nor does it typically have room for the move. Calm Mind is a decent win condition, but Blissey is better used in a supporting role. Blissey can also use Healing Wish to bring a teammate back to full health, but Blissey already supports its team well enough with Heal Bell and Wish.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Machamp, Lucario, Infernape, and Mienshao all hit Blissey for super effective damage with their Fighting-type STAB moves, thus forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: If Blissey is hit by Taunt, it will be unable to do much, and the foe can subsequently use it as setup bait. Crobat and Tornadus are a few Pokemon that can Taunt Blissey.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Blissey cannot spread status to Pokemon behind a Substitute, so they can use it to gain a free turn to set up or attack. Furthermore, if the foe has a maximum HP stat of 404 or higher, Seismic Toss will fail to break its Substitute in one hit. Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune and Chandelure easily set up Substitute against Blissey, with Suicune having 404 HP to avoid having its Substitute broken in one shot and Chandelure being immune to the Fighting-type Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Lum Berry</strong>: Similar to Substitute, Lum Berry provides Pokemon with protection from Blissey's attempts to inflict status on them. Haxorus, for example, enjoys having Lum Berry to protect itself from a single Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Though Blissey can take a few physical hits with its high HP and some Defense investment, she should only be switching into special attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "De Blob (Cleric)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish recovers Blissey's HP and can be used to heal its teammates as well. Thunder Wave allows Blissey to cripple opposing sweepers with paralysis, making it more difficult for them to sweep. Protect allows Blissey to stall out the foe with Toxic and heal itself safely with Wish. Soft-Boiled gives Blissey reliable recovery, prolonging its presence on the field. Seismic Toss gives Blissey some offensive presence and will break Substitutes if the foe's maximum HP stat is less than 404. Heal Bell lets Blissey act as a cleric, while Toxic can be used to put a timer on opposing sweepers and defensive Pokemon. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used to punish opposing switch-ins, allowing Blissey's teammates to sweep more easily. There are several combinations of Blissey's viable moves outside of the slashes seen here. However, every Blissey needs a recovery move and Seismic Toss in order to stay alive longer and not be completely shut down by Taunt, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in HP and Defense and a Bold nature maximize Blissey's physical bulk and allow it to pass the largest Wishes possible to its teammates. Natural Cure allows Blissey to cure itself of status simply by switching out, and Leftovers provides Blissey with passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Blissey's main jobs are tanking special attacks and spreading status. Switch out if the opponent sends in a physical attacker; Blissey can take a few physical hits if need be, but it shouldn't be if it doesn't have to. Pokemon holding Lum Berry and Substitute users are major problems for this set, as they can get past Blissey's Toxic and get free turns. Seismic Toss may provide Blissey with some offensive potential, but it remains serious Taunt bait. Be cautious when trying to pass Wishes to teammates with low health, as the opponent can recognize this and KO the intended recipient. Moreover, as Roar and Whirlwind hit through Protect, Blissey can easily be phazed out when attempting to heal itself with Wish.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A dedicated physical wall can deal with the physical attackers that give Blissey trouble. Nidoqueen, for example, makes a good partner, because it covers Blissey's Fighting-type weakness. Chesnaught and Arcanine make passable partners as well. Entry hazard removal is necessary, as Taunt users and physical attackers easily force Blissey out, and you will be switching Pokemon around a lot in order to keep passing Wishes, provided Blissey is running Wish. Donphan and Forretress are great Rapid Spinners that double as physical tanks. As Blissey will force a lot of switches itself, an entry hazard setter makes a good partner. Empoleon can both set and remove entry hazards, making it a prime choice. A Taunt user will help against Pokemon with Substitute and phazing moves; Tornadus's Prankster Taunt makes it a good option. You also need teammates that Blissey can support; you can pair it with nearly any setup sweeper in order to keep said sweeper healthy. Good setup Pokemon that it can support include Haxorus, Mega Absol, and Lucario.</p>"

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<p>Celebi's well-rounded base stat distribution makes it a solid option for offensive teams, defensive teams, and even balanced teams, and its vast movepool with great coverage options for its offensive sets and fantastic utility options for its supportive sets grants it extreme versatility. Celebi also has a useful ability in Natural Cure, allowing it to heal itself of status upon switching out. Celebi is one of the best checks to bulky Water-types because it is able to set up faster than them and has Natural Cure to heal off burns from Scald. Thanks to its bulk, Celebi often gets multiple opportunities to set up as well. Furthermore, Celebi has a great matchup against most other Stealth Rock setters, as well as entry hazard removers, due to its speed, typing, and coverage. However, despite Celebi's many coverage options, it will always get walled by at least one Pokemon, depending on its moveset. Celebi also struggles to take on many faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users. It is weak to seven different typings, including some that are offensively dominant in UU such as Fire, Ice, and Dark. It notably takes super effective damage from some of UU's most common priority moves in Ice Shard, Sucker Punch, and Shadow Sneak. The weakness to Dark also makes Celebi more vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped. Lastly, Celebi is extremely weak to Bug, allowing many faster Pokemon with U-turn to easily take advantage of it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Due to its access to moves such as U-turn, Trick, and Healing Wish, Celebi also has the potential to run a Choice Scarf. Choice Specs is another item that Celebi can run to hit as hard as possible without setting up. Additionally, Celebi can be used as a Swords Dance sweeper with Seed Bomb, Zen Headbutt, and Sucker Punch. Another option could be to use Celebi as a bulky setup sweeper with either Nasty Plot or Calm Mind paired up with Recover.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Many Pokemon that outpace Celebi can beat it one-on-one in most scenarios. Examples include Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, Crobat, Mega Absol, and Mega Houndoom. Additionally, many of UU's Choice Scarf users, such as Mienshao, Hydreigon, Darmanitan, and Heracross, are able to pressure Celebi at the very least.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Celebi is weak to Ice, Dark, and Ghost, meaning that it will struggle against some of UU's most frequently seen priority moves in Ice Shard from threats such as Mamoswine, Sucker Punch from threats such as Toxicroak, and Shadow Sneak from Doublade.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Celebi's Attacks</strong>: There are certain Pokemon that will wall Celebi depending on its moveset. For example, without Dazzling Gleam, Celebi is not able to effectively hit Hydreigon or Mandibuzz. However, if Celebi forgoes Earth Power, Shadow Ball, or Hidden Power for Dazzling Gleam, it will not be able to effectively hit Steel-types like Doublade or Metagross.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Celebi is easily exploitable due to its 4x weakness to Bug. Mega Beedrill is easily able to take Celebi one-on-one or force it out and gain momentum with U-turn. Many U-turn users, even those that lack Bug typing but can outpace Celebi, are also able to take advantage of Celebi by forcing it to either switch out and give the opponent momentum or take a large amount of damage. Mienshao and fully invested Crobat, for example, are able to do upwards of 70% with U-turn to offensive variants. Even Choice Scarf Hydreigon, which runs no Attack investment and a Timid nature, is able to do upwards of 55% to offensive variants of Celebi.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Entei and Infernape are able to hit Celebi with their super effective STAB moves after either taking a hit or simply outpacing it.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Mamoswine and Kyurem are able to either do considerable damage to Celebi or beat it one-on-one. Life Orb Mamoswine's Ice Shard does a solid amount of damage to offensive variants of Celebi, while Icicle Crash can threaten bulky variants. Choice Specs Kyurem is able to take any attack before OHKOing offensive or physically defensive variants of Celebi while still beating any specially defensive variant.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Some of UU's most prominent Dark-types, such as Mega Absol and Mega Sharpedo, are easily able to threaten Celebi. Hydreigon, arguably the best Pokemon in UU, is able to threaten and wall any variant of Celebi that lacks Dazzling Gleam. Celebi also fears losing its item to Knock Off from the likes of Sableye.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Celebi fears being up against a +2 Doublade, or even Shadow Claw variants without any boosts. Earth Power is able to do a lot of damage to Doublade, but it does not OHKO and therefore gives Doublade a chance to hit Celebi super effectively for a lot of damage. Choice Scarf Chandelure is able to take Celebi out with a Fire Blast. However, even other variants of Chandelure are most likely able to take an Earth Power before OHKOing Celebi in return.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl are able to either severely damage or even beat Celebi before it is able to retaliate. Gyarados, in most scenarios, can set up a Dragon Dance after taking any hit and proceed to take out Celebi with Bounce.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is used to raise Celebi's damage output and set it up for wallbreaking or a potential sweep. Giga Drain is great for keeping Celebi healthy, especially if you opt for a Life Orb. Energy Ball is an alternative that could be used for its higher damage output. It has noticeable perks when you opt for Leftovers such as an extremely high chance to OHKO Krookodile without any boosts. Psychic is the secondary STAB move, and it allows Celebi to hit Fighting-types and Poison-types super effectively. Dazzling Gleam is in the final moveslot so that Celebi avoids getting walled by certain Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Mandibuzz. Recover can be used instead for reliable recovery, and it can be a nice option to pair up with Energy Ball. Alternatively, Celebi can make use of Earth Power, Shadow Ball, or Hidden Power Fire if the user would prefer dealing with Steel-types better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Celebi to hit as hard as possible without having to compromise its speed. Leftovers is the primary item on this set and offers Celebi passive recovery in addition to Giga Drain. Life Orb can be used instead to maximize Celebi's damage output at the expense of taking recoil and having no additional form of passive recovery. Alternatively, a Colbur Berry could be used in order to take a hit from threats such as Mega Absol, Mega Sharpedo, and Hydreigon more easily before striking back.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Remove counters to Celebi from the game with help from other teammates. Pokemon such as Hydreigon, if Celebi isn't running Dazzling Gleam, and Steel-types, if Celebi isn't running Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire, are able to wall Celebi with ease. Other obstacles that can outspeed and beat Celebi one-on-one, such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Houndoom, also should be taken out of the game. From there, Celebi can set up a Nasty Plot and start breaking walls. However, Celebi doesn't necessarily have to be used as a wallbreaker and can instead act as a late-game sweeper against slower teams if needed. Celebi is great at dismantling common cores for balance. It is able to power through common special walls found on balanced teams such as Florges and Sylveon thanks to its bulk and Nasty Plot and finds many opportunities to set up on the bulky Water-types that anchor most balanced teams as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl can be a good partner for Celebi, as it can beat or Pursuit trap certain threats that trouble Celebi such as Crobat, Mega Beedrill, and Entei. In return, Celebi is able to handle bulky Water-types and Ground-types that Mega Aerodactyl may struggle with. Fairy-types such as Florges and Sylveon make for good partners for Celebi because they deal with Hydreigon and other Dark-types pretty well while only stacking a weakness to Poison. However, certain Dark-types, such as Choice Band Krookodile, may remain threatening. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert make for good partners for Celebi because they cover the weakness to Fire, while Celebi can help them deal with opposing Water-types and Electric-types. Fire-types such as Entei and Mega Houndoom also make for good partners with Celebi because they are able to help with Celebi's 4x weakness to Bug, as well as its weaknesses to Ice and Grass, while Celebi can break down bulky Water-types and Rock-types in return.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is the preferred STAB move for its passive recovery and ability to hit Water-types super effectively. Psychic can be chosen instead if Celebi is needed to check Fighting-types or Poison-types. Recover is needed for Celebi to heal back up as it begins to get whittled down. Celebi has many options for its third moveslot. Thunder Wave allows it to cripple faster threats, making them easier for the team to deal with. Perish Song allows Celebi to put the opposing Pokemon on a timer, effectively forcing it to either switch out or faint by the end of the third turn. Stealth Rock could be used if the team lacks another user for it. The fourth moveslot can make use of one of the options that weren't used in the previous moveslot, as well as U-turn to gain momentum. A couple of other helpful moves that Celebi could run on this set are Heal Bell and Leech Seed. The former allows Celebi to clear its team of status, and the latter can be used to punish setup sweepers or slowly wear down the opposing team while also keeping healthy more easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Celebi a form of passive recovery apart from Giga Drain. 24 Speed EVs are there so that Celebi can outpace Adamant Honchkrow. 240 HP EVs maximize Leftovers recovery. The remaining EVs and a Bold nature are used to make Celebi as physically defensive as possible and a better check to Fighting-types. Alternatively, an EV spread of 240 HP / 244 SpD / 24 Spe with a Calm nature can be used to better take special attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise and Mega Sceptile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Celebi can act as a lead in order to set up Stealth Rock, cripple a Pokemon with Thunder Wave, or even just fire off whichever STAB move it is using. It can pivot into neutral or resisted hits and use one of its attacks or support moves from there. Recover should be used frequently so that Celebi can keep healthy after taking repeated hits. Perish Song can be used in order to force out setup sweepers like Suicune and Reuniclus, or to force a Pokemon to faint in three turns if it is the last one standing on your opponent's side of the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulkier Pokemon capable of removing hazards, such as Tentacruel, Crobat, or Mandibuzz make for a good partner for Celebi, as they offer entry hazard removal for the team. Tentacruel has the added bonus of checking Fire-types, who otherwise threaten to OHKO Celebi with their STAB. Special walls like Florges and Blissey to complement physically defensive Celebi, or physical walls like Suicune and Alomomola to complement specially defensive Celebi, also make for good partners on defensive teams.</p>"

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is mandatory on every team, and running it on Celebi means you don't have to use another teamslot for a dedicated Stealth Rock user. Leaf Storm is Celebi's strongest STAB move, and it has some noticeable perks such as OHKOing Mega Aerodactyl after Stealth Rock damage and having a decent chance to OHKO Gyarados after Stealth Rock damage. However, Energy Ball can be used so that Celebi doesn't have to deal with the drop in Special Attack, or the accuracy issues. Psychic is the secondary STAB move and allows Celebi to hit Fighting-types and Poison-types super effectively. The fourth slot is for coverage, primarily against Steel-types, which resist both of Celebi's STAB moves. Earth Power is the primary option here, as it has good Base Power and is able to hit most Steel-types, as well as Fire-types, super effectively. Hidden Power Fire can be used instead if the team would prefer to hit targets such as Forretress and Escavalier super effectively, but it comes with lower Base Power and misses out on hitting targets such as Empoleon and Fire-types super effectively. Additionally, if the team desperately needs a lure for Hydreigon, Dazzling Gleam can be used as an alternative, at the expense of being walled by Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment paired with a Timid nature allows Celebi to hit as hard as it can without compromising any of its Speed. Life Orb is used to power up each of Celebi's attacks and grab many more OHKOs and 2HKOs than it would without it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Celebi is able to act as a Stealth Rock user for offensive teams, which means that the team would not need to use another teamslot for a dedicated Stealth Rock user. Celebi can be used to fire off powerful special attacks against offensive teams while also breaking down common physically bulky Pokemon such as Swampert, Suicune, Mega Aggron, and Doublade. Celebi can commonly be chosen as a lead as well, as it outpaces and has a good matchup against most opposing Stealth Rock users and entry hazard removers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spinners like Mega Blastoise and Tentacruel make for good partners, as they clear your side of the field of entry hazards while allowing Celebi's Stealth Rock to stay up. Sky Plate Crobat pairs well with Celebi because it fits well on bulky offense, a good playstyle to use this on. Mega Aerodactyl also makes for a good partner, as it can beat or Pursuit trap threats to Celebi such as Crobat, Mega Beedrill, and Entei.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Sceptile has an excellent combination of offensive stats and Speed as well as a wide movepool with many good coverage options. Furthermore, after Mega Evolving, it has a pretty decent ability in Lightning Rod, which makes Mega Sceptile a good switch into Electric-type attacks. Mega Sceptile has a decent defensive typing with a handful of useful resistances, but it also has a lot of weaknesses and low defenses, which makes it easier to KO. Even though Mega Sceptile's Speed is rather great, it is still outsped by a lot of common Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Mienshao; it also Speed ties with Mega Beedrill and is outsped by Mega Aerodactyl.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Tail can be used to hit Fairy-types, which threaten Mega Sceptile, but it is inaccurate and doesn't have good overall coverage. Rock Slide is another option for hitting Chandelure and Flying-types, which resist Sceptile's Grass-type STAB moves, for more damage, but most types are hit well by Dragon Pulse and Fire-types are better hit by Earthquake anyway. Leech Seed is an option to recover Sceptile's health a bit, but Sceptile doesn't have the bulk to pull the trick off. Synthesis is a recovery move that can improve longevity, but Sceptile does not have the bulk to pull one off without getting hurt badly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Florges, Aromatisse, and Whimsicott are the most reliable counters to Mega Sceptile, as they all can take a hit and beat it with a STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Darmanitan can come in and KO Sceptile with one of their STAB attacks, as Sceptile doesn't have great bulk.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Whimsicott can switch into Mega Sceptile's attacks and steadily recover damage back, and they can KO it afterwards.</p>",

      "All-Out Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is a solid STAB attack that recovers Sceptile's health and doesn't have a drawback. Energy Ball is an alternative for slightly more power at the cost of recovery. Leaf Storm is a very powerful Grass-type STAB move, but it harshly drops Sceptile's Special Attack after use. Dragon Pulse is a secondary STAB attack with good neutral coverage. Focus Blast is a powerful Fighting-type attack that has great overall coverage, but is a little inaccurate.  Hidden Power Fire can be used in the fourth slot instead to 2HKO Doublade and Assault Vest Escavalier, while hitting Forretress harder, but it lacks power otherwise and the imperfect Speed EVs let it be outsped by Jolly Mega Beedrill and makes it tie with Choice Scarf Timid Chandelure instead of outspeeding it. Earthquake is also an option to hit Pokemon such as Chandelure and Infernape harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Overgrow is Sceptile's ability before Mega Evolving, but it isn't really useful, as Sceptile tends to Mega Evolve immediately anyway. Lightning Rod grants Mega Sceptile an immunity to Electric-type attacks, making it a perfect switch-in for them. Maximum Special Attack investment ensures Mega Sceptile hits as hard as possible, and the Speed EVs and Timid nature allow it to Speed tie with Jolly Mega Beedrill and outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Chandelure. If running Earthquake, a Naive nature is recommended, and the 4 SpD EVs can be shifted to Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Sceptile will get a huge boost to its offenses. Use Leaf Storm sparingly, as it will harshly drop Sceptile's Special Attack after use, leaving it fairly weak. If it has been used, switch out to reset Sceptile's stats. Mega Sceptile is a good switch-in to Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type attacks, even gaining a Special Attack boost from the latter. However, switch carefully, as the opponent can predict the switch and hit Mega Sceptile with a more effective move. Mega Sceptile can also be used as a late-game cleaner once special walls are gone. Bringing Mega Sceptile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is wise, as it doesn't have the bulk to switch in itself.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can bring Sceptile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Forretress, make for good teammates, as Sceptile does not have the bulk to switch in directly. Physical attackers such as Lucario, Darmanitan, and Haxorus make for good partners as well because they can break through specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges and Blissey, which hinder Mega Sceptile. Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Escavalier can beat the Fairy-types that hinder Mega Sceptile. Infernape, Rotom-H, and Crobat are also good teammates because they beat Grass-types, which trouble Mega Sceptile. Entry hazard setters such as Nidoqueen and the aforementioned Forretress can help Mega Sceptile KO foes more easily thanks to the chip damage they provide. Lastly, Wish support from Umbreon and Blissey is useful too, keeping Mega Sceptile healthy.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Sceptile to avoid status moves, and it is also a great move to use on a forced switch; this allows Sceptile a free attacking turn, unless the opposing Pokemon uses a sound-based move or has Infiltrator. Giga Drain is a STAB move with a decent Base Power, decent coverage, and excellent synergy with Substitute, as it recovers Sceptile's HP a bit, allowing it to set up more Substitutes. Dragon Pulse is a reliable STAB attack that hits most types neutrally. Focus Blast is used in the fourth slot to hit Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Lucario hard, as they resist Sceptile's STAB attacks, and Focus Blast also has great overall coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Overgrow is Sceptile's ability before Mega Evolving, but it doesn't provide much use outside of letting Giga Drain hit harder when at low health, and Sceptile will Mega Evolve immediately anyway. With Lightning Rod Mega Sceptile can absorb Electric-type attacks upon switching in and gain a Special Attack boost from them. The EV investment maximizes Mega Sceptile's offensive capabilities and the Timid nature lets Mega Sceptile outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Chandelure and Speed tie with Jolly Mega Beedrill. The remaining EVs go in HP to let Mega Sceptile set up a maximum of four Substitutes with HP remaining if it cannot go for Giga Drain.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Sceptile will get a huge boost in its offensive stats as well as a small boost in its Defense stat. Use Substitute on a predicted switch; this allows Mega Sceptile to get a free attacking turn most of the time. Mega Sceptile is a good switch-in for Electric-type attacks, as Lightning Rod will raise Mega Sceptile's Special Attack, making it even more powerful. However, Sceptile should switch in carefully, because Mega Ampharos can knock it out with Dragon Pulse if the opponent predicts the switch. Mega Sceptile is a good switch-in for Grass- and Water-type attacks, as it can easily take an attack because of its 4x resistances and can hit their users with a powerful STAB attack or just set up a Substitute. Although Sceptile can switch into certain types of attacks, it isn't bulky enough to switch into most neutral attacks, so bringing it in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is good, as it ensures Sceptile gets a safe switch in so it can Mega Evolve right after.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As mentioned in Usage Tips, slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Forretress are good teammates, as they help Sceptile switch in safely. Fire-types such as Infernape and Chandelure are useful for their ability to take the Ice-type attacks that bother Mega Sceptile and beat these users afterwards. Steel- and Poison-types such as Escavalier, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen are useful for beating the Fairy-types that threaten Mega Sceptile. Physical wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Krookodile, and Haxorus can break through specially defensive walls for Sceptile, and therefore they make for good partners too. Pokemon weak to Grass-, Water-, or Electric-types appreciate Mega Sceptile as a teammate, as it can switch into these attacks and beat those Pokemon. Wish support from Umbreon and Blissey is useful to keep Mega Sceptile healthy.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Sceptile to boost its Attack to great levels. Leaf Blade is a powerful STAB attack with decent coverage. Dragon Claw is a secondary STAB move that achieves great coverage alongside Leaf Blade. Outrage is another usable Dragon-type attack with more power than Dragon Claw, but it leaves Sceptile confused and unable to switch out. Earthquake is an option for the last slot, as it hits the Steel-types that resist Mega Sceptile's STAB combination. Drain Punch is another option because it can allow Mega Sceptile to break through common walls that usually would switch into it, such as Blissey and Umbreon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Overgrow is Sceptile's ability before Mega Evolving, but it doesn't provide much utility. Lightning Rod is Sceptile's ability after Mega Evolving and makes it a great switch-in to Electric-type moves. Sceptilite allows Sceptile to Mega Evolve and gain a huge boost in stats. 252 Attack and Speed EVs maximize Mega Sceptile's offensive capabilities, and the Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Chandelure and Speed tie with maximum Speed Jolly Mega Beedrill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Sceptile will become way more powerful than its normal forme. Use Swords Dance on a forced switch; this gives Sceptile an easier time to sweep. Mega Sceptile can be easily switched into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type attacks; it takes barely anything from the former two and is immune to the latter. However, it should certainly be wary of Scald, which can burn Sceptile and weaken it a lot. Bringing Sceptile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is good, as it usually doesn't have the bulk to switch in directly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can bring Sceptile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Forretress, make for good teammates, as Sceptile generally doesn't have enough bulk to switch in itself. Mega Sceptile appreciates special wallbreakers such as Chandelure and Hydreigon, which can take care of some physical walls that hinder Mega Sceptile during its sweep, such as Forretress and Gligar. Pokemon that take advantage of Sceptile's ability to lure in special walls, such as Chandelure, make for good partners too. Pokemon such as Escavalier can reliably beat the Fairy-types that get in Mega Sceptile's way, and Crobat and Rotom-H can take care of Grass-types. Entry hazard setters such as Nidoqueen, Froslass, and Forretress are good teammates, as entry hazard support can help Mega Sceptile KO foes more easily. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Florges and Blissey is appreciated too, as burn is troublesome for Mega Sceptile. Wish support from Umbreon and Blissey is useful to keep Mega Sceptile healthy.</p>"

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Swampert has reasonable 100 / 90 / 90 bulk which makes it an ideal defensive wall alongside its unique Water / Ground typing, which gives it one weakness, while sporting several resistances and one immunity. Swampert is one of the few Pokemon that stops Fire-type wallbreakers such as Darmanitan and Entei cold. Unfortunately, a 4x weakness to Grass-type moves makes it susceptible to easy OHKOs should one mispredict; however, Swampert's strengths far exceed any potential weaknesses. Access to Stealth Rock and Roar makes Swampert an ideal entry hazard shuffler. Furthermore, Swampert's Mega Evolution has access to Swift Swim and has base 110 / 110 defenses as well as base 150 Attack, making it an ideal rain sweeper. After using Rain Dance, Mega Swampert's Speed is doubled and alongside its huge base 150 Attack allows it to be an effective wallbreaker. However, the downside is that Mega Swampert suffers from a lack of any sort of reliable recovery, making it susceptible to being whittled down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set is a viable option, and some Speed EVs can be used to hit certain Speed tiers. Assault Vest can also be used to some effect. Mega Swampert can utilize a bulky RestTalk set for a reliable means of recovery. A specially bulky mono-attacking Curse + RestTalk set is another option. Curse with three attacks or Curse with two attacks and Rest are also alternatives.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Shaymin, Roserade, and Chesnaught all pose significant problems to Swampert, as they outspeed the defensive sets and can OHKO or 2HKO with a Grass-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Common Toxic users such as Crobat and Umbreon can help the opponent's team whittle down Swampert. Toxic Spikes also poses a problem for this reason.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Choice Band Machamp and Choice Scarf Mienshao 2HKO the defensive set, while Hydreigon and Mega Blastoise cause Swampert serious problems due to their superb wallbreaking capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: No Swampert set will be able to break through CroCune or Alomomola. Rocky Helmet Alomomola will trouble the rain sweeper set by causing damage every time Swampert uses a contact move such as Waterfall or Ice Punch.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is used for racking up entry hazard damage, while Earthquake is a powerful STAB option even with little investment. Scald is a secondary STAB option with a 30% chance to burn, increasing Swampert's utility. Roar allows Swampert to phaze, with an added benefit of accumulating Stealth Rock damage. Toxic allows Swampert to spread status around, contributing to wallbreaking and sweeping, and Protect allows Swampert to scout against Choiced Pokemon. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used to nail Grass-types and Dragon-types, such as Rotom-C, Whimsicott, and Hydreigon, for decent damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread allows Swampert to take on most non-Choice Band attackers and set up Stealth Rock, while also hitting a Leftovers number. Leftovers is used for passive recovery and overall longevity. Torrent should be the primary option, as it lets Swampert score extra 2HKOs with Scald once it activates. Damp can be used to prevent the rare Self-Destruct or Explosion. Swampert can also use a specially defensive set, with an EV spread of 240 HP / 16 Atk / 252 SpD and a Sassy nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swampert should be used as a defensive wall and entry hazard shuffler. Swampert acts as a decent lead, as it can take on frail Choice Scarf leads such as Darmanitan as well as Nidoking and Mega Absol and can usually dominate most offensive Pokemon when it has the type advantage. Mixed attacking options mean Swampert can take on burn-inflicting Pokemon such as defensive Arcanine and Choice Band Entei.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swampert is useful on stall, semi-stall, and balance cores.

Swampert also partners well with offensive pivots and other U-turn users such as Crobat and Darmanitan which can pivot into Swampert when their matchups are unfavourable. Swampert provides reliable wall support to the plethora of Pokemon, including Florges, Crobat, Machamp, and Shaymin, to name a few, that need a defensive check against Fire-type wallbreakers. Swampert appreciates both offensive and defensive Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Cofagrigus for spinblocking support and for taking defensive pressure off of it by better absorbing Normal- and Fighting-type moves, which are very common. Chandelure in particular can also absorb Fire-type moves via its Flash Fire ability.</p>"

      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance activates Swift Swim, allowing Mega Swampert to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. Waterfall is a primary STAB option that receives a 1.5x boost due to rain and has a 20% flinch rate, which partners well with Swift Swim's Speed boost and provides more wallbreaking opportunities. Earthquake is an effective STAB option against most Pokemon that either resist or are immune to Water-type attacks. Ice Punch is used to hit Grass- and Flying-types, while Power-Up Punch allows Mega Swampert to boost its Attack stat and consequently become a much larger threat. Superpower can be used instead to hit common Normal- and Dark-types, including Snorlax, Hydreigon, Blissey, and Umbreon. Ice Beam provides a harder hit on physically defensive Pokemon, such as Chesnaught, while Sludge Wave can be used to OHKO Whimsicott.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs allow Mega Swampert to hit as hard as possible and 252 Speed EVs ensure that Mega Swampert outspeeds the entire non-Choice Scarf tier as well as any Pokemon at or under base 95 Speed that uses Choice Scarf. Swift Swim doubles Mega Swampert's Speed after a Rain Dance. A Jolly nature can be used in order to outspeed almost all Choice Scarf users in the tier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The first thing Mega Swampert should do is set up Rain Dance in order to optimize its wallbreaking potential. Use it as an early-game wallbreaker or late-game sweeper. Avoid using Mega Swampert as a lead; a bad matchup may take away momentum from your team. Lastly, Mega Swampert is very useful alongside balance and bulky offense playstyles but is not very effective against stall, despite its wallbreaking potential.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Swampert partners well with Pokemon that appreciate rain support, such as Toxicroak or a variety of Hurricane users. Tornadus can set up Rain Dance effectively, setting up Swampert for late-game sweeps. Mega Swampert's Rain Dance aids Swift Swim sweepers such as Kingdra or Ludicolo. Mega Swampert appreciates Wish and cleric support from Pokemon such as Florges or Umbreon. Due to its lack of recovery, Mega Swampert appreciates Rapid Spin support from Forretress or Kabutops.

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Mega Swampert's main STAB attack and helps it check many physical attackers in the metagame due to its burn chance. Earthquake is Mega Swampert's strongest move and does decent damage to neutral targets. Rest is Swampert's only means of recovery and its best chance to prevent getting worn down too much. Sleep Talk allows Mega Swampert to still function as a threatening wall even when asleep due to Rest. Roar is a possible option over Sleep Talk in order to phaze many sweepers that otherwise set up freely on this set, such as Reuniclus; however, it is not the optimal choice, as it leaves Mega Swampert unable to do anything while asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A physically defensive spread is preferred alongside a Relaxed nature in order to counter incredibly powerful physical attackers such as Mamoswine and dangerous sweepers such as Cobalion. Damp allows Swampert to absorb the rare Explosion, which comes mostly from Forretress. Alternatively, a specially defensive spread can be used if it needs to check special attackers such as Chandelure and Nidoking.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is supposed to be used as a reliable and durable defensive check to many threats in UU, and it must be backed up by other defensive teammates that can cover Mega Swampert's weaknesses to help it slowly wear down the opposing team. Therefore, use this set as a status absorber, given that Mega Swampert can negate any status ailments with Rest. Always use Rest when Mega Swampert's HP is low to prioritize its health. Switching Mega Swampert into a teammate's Wish, such as Blissey's, may be a good idea if it is too low in HP, especially given how slow it is.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Crobat that cover Mega Swampert's hindering weakness to Grass-types are its best teammates. Special walls are greatly needed, as Mega Swampert will have a hard time switching in or even checking powerful special attackers. Blissey and Florges are stellar special walls, and the former also provides Wish support. Pokemon that can check setup sweepers such as Reuniclus, Suicune, and Snorlax, which have no problem dealing with Mega Swampert, are appreciated, as these threats are all extremely effective in UU. Taunt Jellicent and Sableye can deal comfortably with these three. Entry hazard setters are a must in order to wear down the opponent's team; Roserade is a fine option that also shares great defensive synergy with Mega Swampert.</p>"

Earthquake is its main STAB move and has decent neutral coverage in the tier. Rest prevents Mega Swampert from getting worn down too easily on account of its notable lack of reliable recovery. Ice Punch and Earthquake provide great coverage, with Ice Punch hitting the Flying-types, Grass-types, and Levitate users that Earthquake cannot touch. However, Scald is a fantastic option if the aforementioned threats don't present a problem for the rest of Swampert's team, as it is a very safe option most of the time and can make setting up on physical attackers far easier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A specially defensive EV spread and a Careful nature are needed in order to avoid being easily weakened by powerful special attackers such as Hydreigon; for instance, with this set, defensive Whimsicott's Giga Drain is a mere 3HKO.

An alternate EV spread is 248 HP / 16 Atk / 244 SpD backed by an Adamant nature. This EV spread's selling point is checking Calm Mind Reuniclus by 2HKOing it after just one Curse. Some other impressive feats, including 2HKOing Calm Florges and OHKOing Hoopa without any boosts, are within reach with this spread.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Mega Swampert needs Grass-types and some wallbreakers to be taken out before attempting to clean, try to use it actively, without attempting to clean the opposing team too early. Mega Swampert is a great defensive asset and should be widely used during a game. Try to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Mega Evolving translates to significantly higher Attack and defenses, making switching in far easier. This set performs fairly well against stall, as it can outlast several common opposing setup sweepers. Keep in mind that this set is not vulnerable to Foul Play; Mega Swampert has no problem setting up against the majority of the walls in the tier.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics, prime examples of which include Umbreon and Florges, are crucial, especially with this set being widely used on stall. Defensive Pokemon that cover Swampert's hindering Grass-type weakness, such as bulky Mandibuzz, are very appreciated. Additional special walls are usually needed, as this set isn't that suited to checking some special wallbreakers. This makes Blissey a phenomenal addition, as it is the best option in UU and can also act as a cleric. Because, for the most part, Mega Swampert cannot switch in on very powerful physical wallbreakers, teammates that can, such as the aforementioned Nidoqueen, are quite important. Entry hazard setters, such as Forretress and Roserade, make Mega Swampert's cleaning role substantially easier to fill. Wish passers like Blissey and Umbreon allow Mega Swampert to switch into more attacks and use Rest less frequently.</p>"

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is a Pokemon that can work well in just about any tier. It has great typing offensively: Water / Grass STAB moves coupled with Ice Beam boast perfect neutral coverage (aside from against the irrelevant Shedinja); and defensively: a 4x resistance against Water-type attacks is a big plus, on top of handy resistances to Ground and Steel. More perks that Ludicolo can lay claims to include decent Special Attack and special bulk, access to abilities that allow it to excel in the rain, and a movepool chock-full of options, both offensive and defensive. However, both Ludicolo's damage output and Speed are underwhelming outside of rain. Additionally, physical variants require a boost from Swords Dance to do any significant damage, and Ludicolo's attempts at sweeping are totally shut down by paralysis and hindered by Sticky Web. Finally, its middling physical bulk means that it can easily be overwhelmed by the abundance of physical attackers in the tier, and to top it off, Ludicolo suffers an unfortunate weakness to U-turn, a rather common attack in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Blast is an option on the special Rain Dance sweeper set for coverage against the likes of Abomasnow and Ferroseed, which happily eat up any other attacks that Ludicolo can throw at them. Energy Ball and Grass Knot are alternative Grass-type STAB options for the Rain Dance sweeper that hit harder than Giga Drain; Energy Ball is the more consistent of these two options, while Grass Knot is ideal for use against heavier opponents such as Milotic and Suicune. However, Giga Drain is generally preferable to both of these moves, as Ludicolo wants the recovery for longevity purposes. Scald can be used instead of Hydro Pump or Surf on the Rain Dance sweeper set for its chance of inflicting a timely burn on an opponent, but Ludicolo wants all the power it can get and thus would rather opt for Hydro Pump or Surf. Ludicolo can function as a SubSeed user with Rain Dish; in the rain, it will be recovering a decent amount of HP every turn. However, the issue with this set is that running a single attacking move will leave it walled and rendered setup fodder by many threats (such as Toxicroak, for example). Drain Punch is a possible option on the Swords Dance set to help ease Life Orb recoil, but it fails to provide any notable coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Toxicroak</strong>: Toxicroak stands out as a hard counter to Ludicolo thanks to Dry Skin and a resistance to Ludicolo's Grass-type STAB moves, though it should be wary of taking a Zen Headbutt from Swords Dance variants.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Umbreon, Florges, Blissey, and Tentacruel are happy to tank blows from Rain Dance sweeper Ludicolo all day. In Tentacruel's case, Liquid Ooze is troublesome, as it means that Giga Drain will make Ludicolo wear itself down in addition to taking Life Orb recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Fletchinder</strong>: Though it cannot switch directly into Ludicolo for fear of being OHKOed by a Water-type attack, Fletchinder's Acrobatics is guaranteed to outspeed Ludicolo thanks to Gale Wings, and will easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Abomasnow</strong>: Abomasnow gets rid of Ludicolo's rain, limiting its usefulness, and Ludicolo can only inflict a significant amount of damage on it with Focus Blast, which deprives it of the far more consistently useful Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Faster Opponents</strong>: When equipped with a Choice Scarf, faster opponents such as Mienshao outpace Modest / Adamant Ludicolo even when it is raining and, in the latter's case, OHKO Ludicolo with High Jump Kick before it can do anything.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis and Sticky Web</strong>: Paralysis will totally shut down Ludicolo's sweep, and Sticky Web will be a great nuisance to Ludicolo, limiting the number of threats it can outspeed.</p>",

      "Rain Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is a STAB move that is capable of dishing out incredible damage in the rain. Surf is a more reliable alternative that won't suffer an untimely miss, though there is a significant drop in damage output. Giga Drain is a secondary STAB choice that allows Ludicolo to restore health (useful in conjunction with Life Orb) and overcome bulky Water-type opponents. Ice Beam preys on the Grass-types and Dragon-types that resist Ludicolo's STAB attacks. Rain Dance is in the last slot for setting up rain once it has run out; Ludicolo can also use it for the initial rain setup, though it would prefer an ally to do this.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack and Speed are maxed out so that Ludicolo will hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Modest nature bolsters Ludicolo's damage output further and Ludicolo's Speed is already very high in the rain. However, with a Timid nature, Ludicolo outspeeds Choice Scarf variants of Mienshao and Hydreigon. A Life Orb is the item of choice for this set; it provides Ludicolo with a much-appreciated boost to its damage output, and Giga Drain serves to somewhat mitigate Life Orb's recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Preferably, bring Ludicolo in once an ally has already set up rain for it; this way, Ludicolo does not have to spend a turn doing so, and a dedicated rain support ally's rain will last for 8 turns thanks to Damp Rock. Try and make sure that Ludicolo's checks and counters have been taken care of before trying to sweep with it. Ideally, dispose of entry hazards (here's looking at you, Sticky Web) before attempting to sweep with Ludicolo.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Having an ally that can provide fast rain support with a Damp Rock such as Tornadus is strongly advised. Ludicolo likes entry hazard support; this ensures that its opponents have their Focus Sash / Sturdy broken upon entering the field, and also means that Ludicolo should have an easier time netting KOs. Donphan makes for a good teammate, as it can provide the aforementioned hazards and has good type synergy with Ludicolo. Entry hazards serve to wear Ludicolo down quickly and in Sticky Web's case, hinder its attempts to sweep. Thus, Rapid Spin / Defog support is very appreciated. The aforementioned Donphan can use Rapid Spin to dispose of entry hazards that would otherwise hinder Ludicolo's longevity or its Speed. A physical wallbreaker such as Darmanitan will prove useful for getting past the special walls that Ludicolo despises. Cleric support is a possibility to cure Ludicolo of any debilitating status, especially paralysis.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall is Ludicolo's main attack on this set, capable of dishing out some rather hefty damage after boosts from Swords Dance and the rain. Seed Bomb is Ludicolo's secondary STAB choice, and hits the bulky Water-types that tank Waterfall. Alternatively, one can opt for Bullet Seed for its ability to break past Substitutes. Ice Punch rounds out Ludicolo's coverage. Notably, it preys on the Dragon-types and Grass-types that resist Ludicolo's STAB moves. Rain Dance can be chosen in the last slot for Ludicolo to renew the rainfall when it ceases. However, the initial setup of rain is best left to an ally. Ludicolo can opt to run Zen Headbutt in the last moveslot in order to nail Toxicroak, which would otherwise wall this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Ludicolo's maxed-out Attack and Speed ensure that it will be inflicting as much damage and outspeeding as many opponents as possible. An Adamant nature ups Ludicolo's firepower and is advisable given Ludicolo's mediocre Attack stat, though a Jolly nature can be used should you wish Ludicolo to outspeed Choice Scarf variants of Mienshao and Hydreigon in the rain. A Life Orb is the chosen item on this set, as it grants a much-appreciated boost to Ludicolo's offensive prowess.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ideally, an ally should be the one providing Ludicolo with rain, as Ludicolo would rather not have to use up a turn setting it up, and a dedicated rain support ally with a Damp Rock will be able to summon rainfall for an extended 8 turns. Ludicolo should prioritize the use of Swords Dance over anything else; it needs the boosts to attain the power necessary to sweep. Swords Dance Ludicolo plays as a late-game cleaner and thus should be sent in to finish things up after its allies have worn down the opponent. Ludicolo's checks and counters should definitely be severely weakened or disposed of before it is brought in. Ludicolo is best played on a field where it isn't plagued by entry hazards, especially Sticky Web, which would make Ludicolo's attempt to sweep far more difficult because of the Speed loss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A fast ally capable of summoning the rain is a must. Tornadus is an example of a Pokemon that fits this criteria. Another rain sweeper such as Kabutops works well alongside Ludicolo, as the latter can come in to clean up after an ally has wreaked havoc on the opposing team. Entry hazard support is definitely worth considering, as it means that Ludicolo will have an easier time KOing its opponents, and their Focus Sash / Sturdy will be rendered useless. Donphan synergizes well with Ludicolo and is capable of setting up Stealth Rock. Life Orb recoil will wear Ludicolo down and entry hazards will add to the residual damage or, in the case of Sticky Web, slow Ludicolo down and ultimately decrease its chances of a successful sweep. Donphan can remove hazards with Rapid Spin, and as previously stated, has good synergy with Ludicolo. A specially offensive wallbreaker such as Nidoking or Mega Houndoom will be able to deal with the handful of physically defensive Pokemon that can actually stand up to Ludicolo. Paralysis will bring Ludicolo's sweep to a standstill, and it definitely dislikes having residual damage from poison or burn on top of Life Orb recoil. Cleric support is always useful to have on the team for making Ludicolo healthy again.</p>"

  "Shedinja": {
    "overview": "<p>With an amazing defensive ability in Wonder Guard, Shedinja is immune to any attack that isn't super effective against it. This ability allows Shedinja to take on numerous threats in the tier such as Suicune, Cobalion, and Snorlax. Even with the ability to take on these threats, though, Shedinja is weak to some of the other common types in the tier such as Dark, Fire, and Flying. At first glance, Shedinja's stats may also not seem that great, especially its lowly base 1 HP, which means that it is instantly KOed by passive damage from entry hazards and status moves such as Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Leech Seed. As such, Shedinja should be put on a team built around it with many entry hazard removers and possibly Magic Bounce users such as Espeon and Xatu.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Claw can be used over Shadow Sneak as a Ghost-type STAB move, but Shedinja loses out on a priority move, which is huge considering that it sits at a lackluster base 40 Speed. Toxic can be used over Will-O-Wisp to wear down walls a bit faster. Lum Berry can act as a one-time status absorber. Safety Goggles can be used to combat Mega Abomasnow and absorb powder moves such as Sleep Powder from Venomoth and Roserade.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Dark-, Fire-, Flying-, Ghost-, and Rock-type all hit Shedinja super effectively, breaking its Focus Sash or OHKOing it. Common Pokemon that have these types for coverage include Hydreigon, Mega Aerodactyl, and Crobat, which can be whittled down with Will-O-Wisp, as well as Entei and Chandelure, which are not affected by Will-O-Wisp due to their Fire typing.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from the likes of entry hazards, poison, burn, Leech Seed, and hail will OHKO Shedinja. Phazers pose a threat when entry hazards are on the field, having a random chance to switch into Shedinja. Also, be aware that Mega Abomasnow can come in at any time against Shedinja and KO it with hail.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trappers such as Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl can trap Shedinja and either break its Focus Sash on the switch or OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Mold Breaker users such as Haxorus and Mega Ampharos ignore Shedinja's Wonder Guard and can OHKO it with any of their attacking moves.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet Users</strong>: Rocky Helmet users such as Forretress, Arcanine, and Mandibuzz can come in on any of Shedinja's attacks and instantly KO it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Shedinja to boost its Attack, making it a bigger threat. X-Scissor and Shadow Sneak are Shedinja's best STAB moves. X-Scissor hits Reuniclus and Cresselia, and Shadow Sneak provides Shedinja with some priority to pick off or revenge kill weakened foes such as Chandelure and Espeon. Protect allows Shedinja to scout for super effective attacks or status moves that could potentially threaten it. This increases its longevity by allowing it to not be caught off guard by a surprise coverage move. Will-O-Wisp cripples incoming physical attackers looking to break Shedinja's Focus Sash or OHKO it. It could also offer some residual damage on bulky Pokemon that switch into Shedinja.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Shedinja's EVs are all invested into Attack and Speed to make it hit as hard and as quickly as possible. Investing in any other stat is pointless because it will faint from one hit anyway. A Lonely nature further increases Shedinja's attacking power. Minimizing IVs in both defenses, alongside a defense reducing nature, weakens opposing Ditto while not affecting Shedinja in any way. Focus Sash allows Shedinja to take two super effective hits from foes, giving it a second opportunity to get a KO or wear down a wall.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's best to play conservatively when using Shedinja, especially against Pokemon that could possibly have a move to hit it with, so scout their movesets with Protect when necessary. This really helps against Pokemon that could potentially be running Toxic, such as Porygon2 and Vaporeon. Setting up early- or mid-game is not a good idea, as Shedinja is best used as a late-game sweeper. If your opponent doesn't have many ways to combat Shedinja, try to preserve it for the late-game so that it's almost impossible for the foes to hit Shedinja. If you're running Will-O-Wisp, it should be used whenever Shedinja forces a foe out, potentially crippling an incoming physical attacker can be game-changing.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shedinja's best partners are the entry hazard removers in the tier such as Crobat, Tentacruel, and Mega Blastoise. Entry hazards need to be off of the field for Shedinja to be effective, so it's essential to always have spinners or Defoggers on the team. Magic Bounce users such as Xatu and Espeon also make for good teammates, switching in on any status moves or entry hazards and bouncing them back to the opponent's side. Shedinja also likes bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise to help deal with Fire- and Rock-types attacks aimed at it, and in return, Shedinja can take Grass- and Electric-type moves for them. Steel-types such as Mega Aggron can absorb any Flying-type attacks aimed at Shedinja, although it has to watch out for Fire-type attacks. Slow U-turn or Volt Switch users are great teammates as well, bringing in Shedinja safely and grabbing momentum.</p>"

  "Exploud": {
    "overview": "<p>Exploud might not seem very impressive at first glance, but it's blessed with a single move, Boomburst, that transforms it into a frightening wallbreaker. Boomburst is the sole reason Exploud ever sees the light of day in UU, and this is only amplified by its ability Soundproof, which lets Exploud switch freely into Pokemon that rely on sound-based moves such as Sylveon. Despite these positive traits, Exploud is plagued with a low Speed stat, which leaves it outpaced by common UU threats and limits its wallbreaking potential, while its mediocre defensive typing leaves it liable to being easily revenge killed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed Life Orb set with Hammer Arm might seem plausible to break past Blissey, but with Exploud's fragility and low Speed, it finds itself worn down very easily, and sacrificing its overall effectiveness for a single threat isn't worth it. Work Up could be used so that Exploud may function as a stallbreaker, but it prefers the immediate power Choice Specs offers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey is the most reliable counter to Exploud, as it is never 2HKOed by Focus Blast and can heal off any damage Exploud inflicts upon it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Cobalion, Hydreigon, and Entei can all outspeed Exploud and KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Doublade and Chandelure can prevent Exploud from freely using Boomburst, but they must be wary of Scrappy and are vulnerable to coverage moves such as Fire Blast and Surf.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst is Exploud's most powerful STAB move with very few drawbacks, and it should be used most of the time. Focus Blast allows Exploud to break through the Steel-types that resist Boomburst such as Empoleon, while also hitting Blissey for solid damage. However, Blissey must be severely weakened for it to be beaten. Fire Blast hits Bronzong and Doublade, which would otherwise wall Exploud. Surf OHKOes Chandelure and nails Mega Aerodactyl for solid damage, but it's worth noting that Boomburst still hits it very hard. Sleep Talk is a viable option if you'd like Exploud to work as a sleep absorber. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast if you prefer accuracy rather than power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment enables Exploud to hit as hard and fast as possible. Soundproof allows Exploud to switch freely into Pokemon such as Sylveon and gives it a niche over Porygon-Z, which otherwise outclasses it in all aspects. Scrappy is an option to surprise Ghost-type Pokemon such as Doublade and Chandelure, but it is largely inferior to Soundproof. Choice Specs augments Exploud's power by a large degree and allows it to hit incredibly hard, an example of which is being able to 2HKO defensive Porygon2 after Stealth Rock. Timid is an option over Modest, as it allows Exploud to outrun Modest Nidoqueen and Modest Mega Blastoise, as well as slower offensive threats such as Crawdaunt. However, Exploud sorely misses the extra power, such as failing to easily 2HKO Porygon2 and OHKO most Nidoqueen variants.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's best to utilize Exploud as a hit-and-run attacker, as its subpar bulk reduces its staying power. This makes support through Volt Switch or U-turn optimal to get it in safely. Alternatively, it can be brought in after a teammate has fainted or through double switches. Boomburst should be used the majority of the time, as nothing likes to switch into it. Exploud's coverage options should only be used when absolutely necessary, such as when predicting an appropriate switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Gligar, Mienshao, Crobat, and Forretress, are all great partners, as they give Exploud switch initiative. Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Toxicroak, and Mienshao make for good partners as well because they can all beat Blissey. Mienshao in particular is a good teammate, as it can also provide U-turn support. Crobat and Gligar deserve special mention, as they can both take on Fighting-types and offer support in the form of U-turn and entry hazard removal. Galvantula provides both Volt Switch and Sticky Web support, which temporarily mitigates Exploud's Speed issues. That being said, Exploud appreciates all forms of speed control, which makes Whimsicott and Hoopa nice teammates, because the former gives Stun Spore support and the latter provides Trick Room. Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Sylveon and Gardevoir are great teammates, as they can beat opposing Fighting-types. Gardevoir can also offer Healing Wish support, which gives Exploud a second chance to wallbreak. Finally, setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Mega Swampert, and Cobalion all appreciate Exploud's wallbreaking ability.</p>"

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>Sableye's access to Prankster allows it to shut down a vast majority of physical attackers, setup sweepers, walls, and weak special attackers before they can cause harm thanks to a combination of priority Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. Sableye also has access to the ever-reliable Recover, preventing it from being worn down quickly, thus allowing it to annoy teams throughout an entire match. Sableye is blessed with a rare type combination, and because of a priority Taunt, Sableye serves as a reliable Defog and Rapid Spin blocker for Spikes-stacking teams. Its typing also grants Sableye key immunities to the STAB moves of relevant offensive threats, such as Snorlax, Mienshao, and Reuniclus. Access to Knock Off furthers its capacity as a stallbreaker, especially considering most of Sableye's checks and counters don't appreciate having their item removed.</p> <p>Despite having a great ability and a movepool that pairs well with Prankster, Sableye's mediocre base stats make it hard, impossible even, to switch in on a lot of the threats it's supposed to beat, and this usually results in Sableye losing to most special attackers. Because of an overwhelming lack of any offensive presence and such weak base stats, Sableye is extremely reliant on Will-O-Wisp and can be pressured to use Recover fairly easily. The ever-growing popularity of wallbreakers that Sableye can't shut down, specifically Entei, Hydreigon, Bulk Up Conkeldurr, and Nasty Plot Celebi, leaves it susceptible to offensive pressure. Sableye's specialized moveset also lets powerful offensive Pokemon like Conkeldurr and Mega Absol come in for free and immediately threaten it, but it can limit any setup in the former's case. Common defensive Pokemon, such as Sylveon and Diancie, scoff at anything Sableye is capable of doing in return and force it out with Pixilate Hyper Voice or Moonblast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Prankster and access to Taunt make Sableye a good option as a weather setter on specialized teams, allowing it to reliably set Sunny Day or Rain Dance. However, Sableye will lose some functionality, as one of its regular supporting moves will have to be dropped. Seismic Toss is an option as a reliable damaging move but is usually outclassed by all of the options mentioned in the main set. Sableye has access to a few interesting niche support options, such as Confuse Ray, Trick, Icy Wind, Psych Up, and Snatch. These can be used to catch opponents off guard but won't provide the same level of support as the four moves seen on the main set. Calm Mind allows Sableye to surprise strong special attackers that it would normally be unable to handle, but it's an inferior option to the Prankster set because it forces Sableye to drop either Taunt or Will-O-Wisp while still leaving it completely helpless against both Sylveon and Whimsicott.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: Thanks to their immunity to Will-O-Wisp, Fire-type Pokemon in general can turn Sableye into a liability. Mega Houndoom and Infernape in particular aren't threatened much by Knock Off and can either freely set up Nasty Plot or retaliate with powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Both Sylveon and Florges can come in consistently on Sableye due to their access to reliable recovery and Heal Bell. Whimsicott and Diancie, despite being prone to getting worn down very quickly, can also switch in on Sableye and threaten it with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage:</strong> Sableye doesn't appreciate taking burns from Scald, as those force it to use Recover more frequently, making it a lot easier for the opponent to play around Sableye. The same applies to Will-O-Wisp burns, Toxic, and entry hazard damage, as Sableye will be forced into using Recover prematurely, thus potentially exposing it to an opposing Taunt or giving the foe a free turn to set up.</p> <p><strong>Guts Users</strong>: Even though neither of them appreciates getting their item removed, Conkeldurr and Heracross discourage Sableye from using Will-O-Wisp and can threaten it with their powerful moves as well.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers:</strong> Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Rotom-C have the ability to nuke Sableye into oblivion with their Choice Specs-boosted STAB moves. However, they should be wary of Snarl variants, as those can potentially stall them out of PP.</p> <p><strong>Mega Absol</strong>: In spite of being prone to getting burned in its regular forme, Mega Absol can use Sableye as setup bait. If played well enough, Justified Absol can come in on a predicted Knock Off, gain an Attack boost, Mega Evolve to prevent a burn, and proceed to beat or set up on Sableye. However, Mega Absol must be wary of a potential Foul Play which is capable of OHKOing it after a Swords Dance boost.</p>",

      "Prankster": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Recover allows Sableye to stick around throughout the match, advancing to the top of the priority bracket and reliably healing half of Sableye's total HP. Will-O-Wisp helps Sableye handle most physically offensive Pokemon better, as a burn is capable of shutting down a plethora of physical threats. The move is also great for racking up chip damage against bulkier threats, potentially wearing them down for a teammate. Taunt is lethal against defensive Pokemon, simply preventing any attempts at setting up entry hazards, clearing hazards with Defog, statusing Sableye, healing, or Taunting Sableye before it can heal itself. Knock Off, although doing pitiful damage to most Pokemon, removes the target's item and limits its staying power or offensive presence, making opposing threats easier to wear down. Snarl is used on teams that have an harder time handling strong specially oriented wallbreakers, namely Hydreigon, allowing Sableye to tank repeated hits a lot more easily or allow a teammate to switch in with more ease. Foul Play is also worth considering, since it allows Sableye to damage physically offensive Pokemon a lot harder, most notably Mega Absol, which is free to use Sableye as setup fodder otherwise. However, against defensive teams and most special attackers, it is the inferior choice.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The entire set revolves around Sableye's ability, Prankster, as the boost in priority to Sableye's status moves encompasses its viability; its ability to heal or cripple threats before they can make a move gives Sableye a rather unique niche in UnderUsed. The given EV spread is biased in favor of Special Defense in order to help Sableye manage threats such as Mega Blastoise and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Will-O-Wisp mitigates the need for investment in its Defense stat in most cases: only Fire-types, Pokemon with the Guts ability, and Mega Absol are unperturbed by Will-O-Wisp, and they will beat Sableye one-on-one in most cases regardless. However, an alternate spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish or Bold nature can be used if Sableye's team absolutely needs the extra defensive support and is capable of comfortably taking on a wide range of special attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Without Snarl, Sableye is typically incapable of handing powerful special attackers, such as Choice Specs Hydreigon, Nasty Plot Infernape, and Mega Sceptile, and should not be left in on such threats. However, even with Snarl, Sableye will have a hard time dealing with them. Status conditions will limit Sableye's effectiveness, so it must try to Taunt any status users before receiving a Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Scald users should be avoided by Sableye, as it cannot prevent stray burns from landing. Instead, bring Sableye in on Pokemon with low offensive capacities, like Froslass, Blissey, and Cresselia, and start disrupting the opposing team from there. The certain few offensive Pokemon you can safely switch Sableye in on are those that can't do much back to it, like Toxicroak, Reuniclus, and Snorlax.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Answers to powerful special attackers, such as Nasty Plot Infernape and Choice Specs Hydreigon, are a must, as both can easily switch in on Will-O-Wisp and begin demolishing Sableye with powerful STAB attacks. It's a tall order, but Pokemon like Cresselia can beat Nasty Plot Infernape, and Sylveon walls Hydreigon. Faster offensive teammates, like Tornadus and Mega Aerodactyl, will also remove both Infernape and Hydreigon with ease, but they cannot afford to switch into them. Entry hazard setters such as Forretress, Swampert, and Froslass benefit from Sableye's ability to block both Rapid Spin and Defog. The hazards such Pokemon set give Sableye an easier time pressuring the opposing team, as it forces a lot of switches and will be able to rack up additional chip damage. Pokemon that can tank hits from the Fire- and Fairy-type Pokemon that constantly threaten Sableye on the battlefield are naturally good partners for it. Empoleon can switch in for free on Sylveon and Florges and proceed to lay down Stealth Rock, while Suicune is easily one of the best blanket checks to Fire-type Pokemon in the tier. Generally bulky Pokemon, such as Sylveon, Snorlax, Mega Aggron, and Gligar, make for excellent teammates, as Sableye's naturally low defensive stats and inability to cripple a select group of attackers still leave it liable to powerful attacks. Cleric support from Sylveon or Blissey will allow Sableye to be played more recklessly, as it won't need to fear status as much. For more offensively oriented teams, Pokemon that benefit from Sableye's ability to disrupt and wear down teams with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off are great partners. Good examples of such Pokemon include Mega Sharpedo, Mega Swampert, Lucario, and Tornadus. Keep in mind that Pokemon like these really thrive on Spikes-stacking teams and Sableye alone is not enough to let them thrive.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Aggron's Mega Evolution boasts a ridiculously high base 230 Defense stat. Furthermore, its ability, Filter, reduces the amount of damage taken from super effective attacks by 25%. Mega Aggron's pure Steel typing gives it ten resistances and one immunity. It has access to great support moves, including Stealth Rock, Roar, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Mega Aggron has a good base 140 Attack stat, which lets it fire off strong attacks; however, this is fairly average considering that Mega Aggron cannot use a boosting item. Before Mega Evolving, Aggron has a horrible defensive typing, and after Mega Evolving, it misses out on the passive recovery that Leftovers would give it. Mega Aggron also has a fairly average base 80 Special Defense stat and a pitiful base 50 Speed stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Tail is a damage-dealing phazing move, and it deals with Magic Bounce and Taunt users. Metal Burst can be utilized to tank hits and retaliate with 1.5x the damage taken. Fire Punch can be used to hit Forretress hard, but has little use outside of that. A Choice Band set consisting of Head Smash, Heavy Slam, Earthquake, and Double-Edge is viable but a lot less bulky than Mega Aggron; Aggron's main niche in UU is provided by its Mega Evolution. Finally, Rock Polish can be used to take advantage of Mega Aggron's excellent Attack stat and reasonable Speed after a boost. Its gargantuan bulk also provides Mega Aggron with many potential setup opportunities. However, it is generally outclassed by Aggron and Tyrantrum, which have access to a STAB Head Smash, in this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Mega Steelix and Donphan can take any one of Mega Aggron's attacks and either set up Stealth Rock or retaliate with an attack of their own.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Mega Blastoise, Vaporeon, Suicune, Swampert, and Alomomola take minimal damage from Mega Aggron's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Mega Blastoise, Forretress, and Donphan can get rid of Stealth Rock by using Rapid Spin and take very little damage from Mega Aggron's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Nidoking and Chandelure are both great examples of strong special attackers that can OHKO Mega Aggron. However, they have trouble switching into Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Entei, Rotom-H, Darmanitan, and Chandelure all threaten Mega Aggron with their powerful STAB attacks, which can OHKO or 2HKO it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock damages the foe as it switches in. Roar is a reliable phazing tool and allows Mega Aggron to rack up Stealth Rock damage on the opposing team. However, Toxic may be used instead to cripple walls such as Vaporeon, Suicune, Swampert, and Alomomola, as may Thunder Wave, which Mega Aggron generally uses to paralyze foes on the switch. Heavy Slam has massive power coming off of Mega Aggron's base 140 Attack stat and does serious damage thanks to Mega Aggron's gargantuan weight. Earthquake provides good coverage alongside Heavy Slam, hitting Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-type Pokemon for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment makes Mega Aggron very bulky, allowing it to take hits from both physical and special attacks. 16 Defense EVs and an Impish nature hit a jump point and give Mega Aggron a high chance to survive two Choice Band-boosted Earthquakes from Krookodile. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to help Mega Aggron take special attacks better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In certain situations, it is better to hold off on Mega Evolving Aggron. For example, if Aggron is up against Entei, not Mega Evolving it lets Aggron take less damage from an incoming Sacred Fire; due to Aggron's Rock typing, it will take neutral damage. When running Roar, predict switches wisely. Use an attack that would badly damage the predicted switch-in, or use Roar when you think that Mega Aggron can't do much damage to the predicted switch-in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its lack of recovery, Mega Aggron partners well with Vaporeon, Blissey, Alomomola, Florges, and Aromatisse, as they can all heal it with Wish. Mega Aggron and any of the aforementioned Pokemon also work well together thanks to their good type synergy. Special walls such as Blissey and Florges in particular form a great defensive core with Mega Aggron, as Mega Aggron tanks physical attacks, while the special wall can tank special attacks. Be careful when using the likes of Blissey and Vaporeon, however, as they invite Heracross to come in, which threatens the core significantly. Powerful sweepers such as Nidoking, Darmanitan, and Mienshao are good partners for Mega Aggron because they have an easier time sweeping late-game thanks to Stealth Rock. Bulky Water-types make good teammates for Mega Aggron, as they handle the Fire-types that threaten it. Grass-type Pokemon and Choice Band Guts Machamp can handle the bulky Water-types that threaten Mega Aggron and don't mind switching into Scald.</p>"

      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse makes Mega Aggron a great bulky setup sweeper. Heavy Slam hits very hard due to Mega Aggron's massive weight. Iron Head is an option with more PP and gives Mega Aggron a better matchup against heavy Pokemon such as Snorlax. Rest is Mega Aggron's only recovery option, and it also serves to cure troublesome status such as burn and paralysis. Sleep Talk takes up the fourth move slot, allowing Mega Aggron to boost its stats or attack against opponents while asleep. Earthquake can be used over Sleep Talk to catch Fire-types off guard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs are needed because of Mega Aggron's average base 70 HP stat. Maximum Special Defense investment is used to reduce damage taken from special attackers while setting up with Curse, allowing Mega Aggron to survive two Focus Blasts from defensive Reuniclus, a Fire Blast from Chandelure, a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast from Timid Moltres, and a Modest maximum Special Attack Focus Blast from Mega Ampharos. Careful is the preferred nature, as it greatly improves Mega Aggron's special bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Before setting up with Curse, be sure to weaken or defeat powerful Fire-types, as they can threaten Mega Aggron with their powerful STAB attacks. Pokemon with access to Roar such as Suicune, Vaporeon, Swampert can phaze Mega Aggron while it is trying to set up with Curse. Mega Aggron often loses to bulky setup sweepers such as Suicune, Curse Swampert, Reuniclus, and Doublade, so it's better to take them out before attempting to set up with Curse. Taking out powerful Fighting- and Ground-types before sending Mega Aggron out is very recommended, as they'll give Mega Aggron a hard time setting up. Mega Aggron's setup fodder consists mostly of Fairy-types, passive Pokemon, and physical attackers it can deal with. Thanks to its beastly Defense, and even more so thanks to Rest, Mega Aggron can function as a counter to plenty of physical attackers. A few uses of Curse and the ability Filter work in tandem to allow Mega Aggron to take Lucario's Close Combat and Darmanitan's Flare Blitz easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges or Vaporeon are great partners for Mega Aggron because they can help with super effective special attacks, which Mega Aggron struggles with. Clerics pair well with Mega Aggron, replacing the unreliable Rest with a trusty Wish. Physically defensive Florges will greatly aid Mega Aggron by dealing with Fighting-types. Bulky Water-types like Suicune and Slowking help Mega Aggron with the threat posed by Fire-types and overall pair well with it. Conversely, a Pokemon that can easily defeat bulky Water-types, such as Shaymin or Heliolisk, is very appreciated too. Reliable Ground- and Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Crobat and Cresselia support Mega Aggron decently. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Swampert, Dragalge, Chesnaught, Tentacruel, and Nidoqueen can help wear down common checks and support Mega Aggron for a potential sweep.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mega Sharpedo hits obscenely hard with a Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch and has good coverage. Mega Sharpedo has slightly increased bulk, which lets it take some priority attacks such as Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, it still has to give up a moveslot for Protect to attain a Speed boost before Mega Evolving. Sharpedo and its Mega Evolution are still somewhat reliant on prior damage and entry hazard support in order to secure OHKOs, and, unfortunately, being extremely weak to most priority moves can sometimes prevent a late-game sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aqua Jet can revenge kill weakened Pokemon while stalling for a Speed Boost. Earthquake takes on the many Steel-types in the tier, including Empoleon, Cobalion, and Mega Aggron, but is generally inferior to other options. Zen Headbutt can be useful against Fighting-types such as Heracross, Machamp, Virizion, and the occasional Dragalge. Poison Fang can be used so that Mega Sharpedo has an easier time getting past Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse, and hits Whimsicott even harder. Focus Sash can be used alongside Speed Boost, but the power drop is extremely noticeable. Substitute is a notable option against bulky Water-types such as Suicune, as it protects Mega Sharpedo from Scald burns. Taunt can be used to prevent opposing walls from healing or inflicting status ailments on Mega Sharpedo. Sharpedo can also make use of a specially based Life Orb set with Hydro Pump, Dark Pulse, and Ice Beam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Mega Aggron and Forretress can switch into Mega Sharpedo's moves and beat it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mach Punch and Choice Scarf Infernape and Mienshao as well as Vacuum Wave Lucario work around Mega Sharpedo by forcing it to switch or revenge killing it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Cobalion and Machamp can take a Waterfall and OHKO Mega Sharpedo.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon With Recovery</strong>: Umbreon and Florges can both easily take a Crunch and can work around Mega Sharpedo's other attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune, Swampert, and some Empoleon variants apply defensive pressure to regular Sharpedo, forcing it to risk a burn or 3HKO from Suicune's Scald or an OHKO from Swampert and Empoleon; however, Swampert and Empoleon will generally lose to Mega Sharpedo.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect is used so that Sharpedo can get a Speed boost safely before Mega Evolving, and it also lets Sharpedo scout the foe's moveset. Crunch is Mega Sharpedo's main STAB move and hits for a lot of damage thanks to Strong Jaw. Waterfall is a powerful secondary STAB attack with a flinch chance. Hydro Pump can be used instead to deal more damage to physical walls, such as Forretress and Donphan, than Waterfall does. Ice Fang is used mainly to hit Hydreigon, which can tank Sharpedo's other attacks with little trouble. It also hits Whimsicott harder than everything else on the set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EV spread maximizes Sharpedo's Attack and Speed. A Naughty or Naive nature is used with Hydro Pump so that Sharpedo can attack with both offensive stats while lowering its least useful defensive stat. An Adamant or Jolly nature is used with Waterfall, as Sharpedo's Special Attack is then irrelevant. Jolly and Naive natures deserve special mention, as it is fairly important to outspeed or Speed tie most Choice Scarf users at +1 because Mega Sharpedo is by no means guaranteed to get to +2.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If facing slower teams, Sharpedo should Mega Evolve immediately so that it can punch holes in the opposing team as soon as possible, as it does not need the Speed boost. Against more offensive teams, it should use Protect if it is trying to clean late-game so it can outspeed slower Choice Scarf users before Mega Evolving. In some cases, Sharpedo might need to force the switch and then Protect, or go for the double Protect before Mega Evolving if the opponent has a faster Choice Scarf user, such as Infernape, on their team. Mega Sharpedo only has one chance to sweep because Mega Evolving removes Speed Boost, so it should not be brought in unless it has a very good chance of sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support helps Sharpedo in wallbreaking and cleaning, so Swampert, Chesnaught, Froslass, and Roserade all are all good partners. Entry hazards wear down Mega Aggron, Florges, Empoleon, and Forretress, all of which give Sharpedo trouble, and turns some 2HKOs into OHKOs against Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. Toxic Spikes works well with Protect to get Pokemon down to KO range. Because Sharpedo is best used with entry hazards, pairing it with spinblockers such as Chandelure and Froslass or fast Taunt users such as Crobat benefit it greatly. Pivots that have access to Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Forretress, Heliolisk, and Gligar, all make for good partners, as they can get Sharpedo in safely. If opting to use a Speed-boosting nature, Sharpedo should partner up with good entry hazard stackers, to ensure that it's able to clean up at the end of the game, as the power decrease is noticeable.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect is used to get a Speed boost without taking damage and also scouts the foe's moveset. Crunch offers excellent offensive synergy with Waterfall. Waterfall uses Sharpedo's Speed boosts to try to get a flinch, and also has good coverage, hitting the plethora of Fire- and Ground-types in the tier for super effective damage. Ice Beam is used to hit Pokemon such as Chesnaught and Hydreigon  super effectively. Lastly, Destiny Bond can be used as a last-ditch effort to score an extra KO against a threat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is used to maximize Sharpedo's Attack and outspeed Adamant variants of Choice Scarf Krookodile, with the rest of the EVs dumped into Special Attack so that Sharpedo can hit Chesnaught, Hydreigon, and Toxicroak for as much damage as possible. Life Orb is used to increase its damage output. A Naughty nature is used to increase Sharpedo's Attack stat without lowering its Special Attack and is used over Lonely so Sharpedo can take less damage from priority attacks, although Mach Punch from any notable Pokemon still OHKOes Sharpedo. Lastly, if Ice Beam is not used, opt for an Adamant or Jolly nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sharpedo should be saved until late-game, when the opposing team's Pokemon have been weakened, as it usually needs a fair amount of prior damage to clean. Sharpedo should not be switched in at any cost, as it takes a lot even from resisted hits due to its terrible defenses. Ultimately, Sharpedo appreciates the removal of priority users so that it can clean late-game uninterrupted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress, Froslass, Swampert, Chesnaught, and Mega Aggron is appreciated, as it wears down Pokemon that try to switch into Sharpedo, making it easier for Sharpedo to clean late-game.

Toxic Spikes works well with Protect to get Pokemon down to KO range. Pivots such as Mega Ampharos, Gligar, and Rotom-H make for good partners, as they can keep up offensive momentum, slowly wear down the opposing team, and bring in Sharpedo safely.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>On paper, Mega Camerupt has many of the tools requred to be an offensive or defensive staple in Underused. In practice however, Mega Camerupt is quite subpar: it either trades the ability to hit like a truck for its defensive prowess or vice-versa, and its paltry Speed stat guarantees opposing Taunts or attacks will land before Mega Camerupt has an opporunity do anything. A lack of reliable recovery and poor defensive typing also puts Mega Camerupt on a timer: without Wish support, Mega Camerupt will be worn down quickly. If anything, access to Stealth Rock gives it a tiny niche on bulkier teams in terms of role compression. However it comes at the cost of consuming a team's Mega slot; Mega Swampert, Mega Aerodactyl, and the other Mega Evolutions accessible to Underused are much better options and provide more utility for their team. Because of how little Mega Camerupt actually offers a team, it is recommened that other Mega Evolutions be considered over Mega Camerupt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sashes and wears foes down so Camerupt and allies can KO enemies easier, but because of Camerupt's low Speed, entry hazard setting is better done by other Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. Roar phazes out opponents, but Camerupt doesn't have a slot available to use it, as it will lose out on an important coverage move. Explosion is another usable option when Camerupt is about to faint as it deals great damage, but wastes a powerful Mega Pokemon if used too soon. Iron Head hits Fairy-types such as Florges and Sylveon, but doesn't have good coverage and has no other relevant targets. Toxic can be used to wear down foes turn after turn, but Camerupt isn't a good user of it because of the lack of reliable recovery. A RestTalk set is Mega Camerupt's only option for recovery, but leaves it with only two coverage options, which it cannot afford.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey is the only specially defensive Pokemon that can take on Mega Camerupt rather well, as it is only 3HKOed by Fire Blast and can Toxic Camerupt and stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Suicune, Swampert, Gyarados, Mega Sharpedo, and Tentacruel can OHKO Camerupt easily with one of their STAB attacks, but have trouble switching in on specific STAB or coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Krookodile and Nidoking can easily beat Camerupt with a Ground-type STAB attack.</p>",

Earth Power is a secondary STAB attack with great coverage alongside Fire Blast and decent power, and is also boosted by Sheer Force. Ancient Power is boosted by Sheer Force and hits Flying-types for super effective damage, most notably Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat. Hidden Power Grass can be used in the fourth slot to catch Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon on the switch. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers by halving their Attack stat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Solid Rock, Camerupt's ability before Mega Evolving, helps it take super effective hits better if an opponent predicts the switch. Sheer Force, Mega Camerupt's ability, gives a great power boost to Camerupt's attacks with a secondary effect. Cameruptite allows Camerupt to Mega Evolve into Mega Camerupt. Max HP and Special Attack investment help Mega Camerupt take hits better and hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature gives another boost to Camerupt's great Special Attack. If Camerupt is used on a Trick Room team, make sure to use a Quiet nature.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Camerupt fits best on bulky offense teams because of its ability to take hits and hit opponents back quite hard with a STAB attack. Make sure to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, because Mega Camerupt will get a huge boost in its offensive stats as well as its defensive stats. Try to predict when an opposing check or counter might come in; for example, if you predict a Swampert to come in, make sure to go for Hidden Power Grass or Will-O-Wisp, instead of hitting it with Fire Blast. Switch out of threatening Water-types, because their STAB attacks will most likely OHKO Mega Camerupt. Ground-types are threatening too as they outspeed and beat Camerupt with a STAB attack. Mega Camerupt can switch into predicted Volt Switches and other Electric-type moves to force opposing Pokemon to switch out in most situations and get off a lot of damage on the opponent's next switch-in. Bringing Mega Camerupt in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is good, too, as it cannot recover any damage taken by switching in normally without healing support.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick Room support from Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Cofagrigus is especially great, because then Mega Camerupt will usually move first. Pokemon that can switch into Water-types for Camerupt and beat them, such as Roserade and Shaymin, make for good partners. Pokemon that can reliably beat Ground-types that threaten Camerupt, such as Chesnaught and Suicune, are excellent teammates as well. Wish support from Pokemon such as Blissey and Florges is really good for Camerupt, as it lacks its own form of reliable recovery. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Forretress is nice, too, as this will give Mega Camerupt an easier time wallbreaking. Furthermore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Crobat and Tentacruel are good partners, as Mega Camerupt cannot recover from chip damage taken. Slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Forretress are great for Mega Camerupt because it cannot recover damage taken while switching in. Lastly, special attackers that appreciate Mega Camerupt plowing through their checks and counters, such as Celebi and Sylveon, are good partners.</p>"

However, Crawdaunt is very slow and frail, making it susceptible to many of the faster Pokemon in the tier that can revenge kill it with ease and leaving it heavily reliant on its priority move, Aqua Jet, to be able to damage these Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A fourth attack over Swords Dance on the Swords Dance set can be run to lure in and KO specific checks and counters. For instance, Ice Beam allows Crawdaunt to 2HKO common switch-ins in Chesnaught, Whimsicott, and Hydreigon. Sludge Wave is another option that provides similar coverage to Ice Beam but trades being unable to 2HKO Hydreigon for being able to OHKO Whimsicott. Superpower, on the other hand, doesn't provide as much overall coverage but allows Crawdaunt to OHKO Hydreigon. Dragon Dance, while being a decent option on sets that use Focus Sash, is usually inferior to other options, such as Swords Dance and a fourth attack, due to Crawdaunt's low base Speed that renders it unable to outspeed base 108 Speed Pokemon and anything quicker even after a boost. It does allow Crawdaunt to beat some of its checks, though, which is mostly limited to a few faster Water-resistant Pokemon, including Mega Blastoise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon that Resist Water</strong>: Pokemon that have higher Speed than Crawdaunt and also resist Water-type attacks, such as Hydreigon and Whimsicott, can easily revenge kill Crawdaunt, as Crawdaunt's only way of damaging them before they OHKO it is Aqua Jet. Heliolisk and Toxicroak get a special mentions for having higher Speed, super effective STAB attacks against Crawdaunt, and an immunity to Water, courtesy of Dry Skin.</p> <p><strong>Quicker Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that have decent physical bulk and outspeed Crawdaunt, such as Cobalion, can easily revenge kill it, as they can survive an Aqua Jet and OHKO Crawdaunt in return.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls can deal with Crawdaunt well, with the best checks depending on its set. For instance, Swords Dance variants are easily dealt with by Chesnaught, whereas variants using four attacking moves are more easily dealt with by the likes of Alomomola.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Crawdaunt's Attack, making it very deadly against defensively oriented teams. Crabhammer is a very strong STAB attack that also has a high critical hit ratio. Knock Off is a good secondary STAB attack that can also remove the item of the opposing Pokemon. Aqua Jet is weaker than Crabhammer and Knock Off, but its priority makes it the go-to move for doing damage to quicker Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash ensures Crawdaunt is unable to be KOed from full HP, allowing it to have a free turn to either get off an attack or use Swords Dance; however, its main purpose is to ensure that Crawdaunt isn't mostly helpless against offensive teams, which tend to not give it any space. Life Orb is also an option due to the boost in power, which allows Crawdaunt to get some crucial KOs, such as against Mega Blastoise after Stealth Rock and a Swords Dance boost. Lum Berry can also be used should a one-time status immunity be more beneficial than the other options. The given EVs maximize Crawdaunt's wallbreaking potential. A Jolly nature is preferable to give Crawdaunt enough Speed to ensure that most bulky Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen and Suicune, are dissuaded from investing enough Speed EVs to outspeed Crawdaunt. An Adamant nature, on the other hand, allows Crawdaunt to hit benchmarks when attacking at the cost of being potentially outsped by many of the aforementioned bulky Pokemon. Adaptability is the ability of choice for boosting the power of Crawdaunt's STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Predict a lot; strong wallbreakers like Crawdaunt that don't have much bulk or Speed don't get many opportunities to wallbreak in a match so make the most of the few turns it is given. In most matches, it's often better to just attack with Crawdaunt instead of setting up, as Swords Dance only benefits Crawdaunt against more defensively inclined teams that use sturdy walls that rely on being able to outlast Crawdaunt to get past it. Be sure to pivot Crawdaunt in on weak attacks or via U-turn and Volt Switch whenever it can get a good matchup. Most importantly, be sure to use Crawdaunt's ability to effectively wallbreak as much as possible during the early game so its teammates are able to clean later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers and cleaners, such as Nasty Plot Lucario and Mega Sharpedo, make for excellent Crawdaunt partners, as they benefit from Crawdaunt's ability to wallbreak effectively. Other wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Darmanitan, Choice Specs Shaymin, and Life Orb Hydreigon, also make for nice Crawdaunt teammates, as they can form good wallbreaking cores with Crawdaunt to break through most teams. Shaymin gets a special mention for having access to Healing Wish, which not only heals Crawdaunt to full HP but also removes any status conditions Crawdaunt may have at the time. Pokemon that have access to speed control moves, such as Tailwind Whimsicott and Sticky Web Galvantula, also make for good teammates, as they can make Crawdaunt faster than its foe and give it more opportunities to wallbreak. Memento users, such as Chandelure and Gardevoir, make for good Crawdaunt teammates, as they can use Memento to give Crawdaunt a free turn to set up a Swords Dance, while Crawdaunt usually breaks down their defensive answers. Entry hazard setters, such as Aerodactyl, make for good Crawdaunt partners as well, as Crawdaunt can get some crucial KOs with entry hazard damage, such as OHKOs on Suicune after a Swords Dance. Similarly, entry hazard removers and suicide leads, such as Forretress and Aerodactyl, respectively, are also good Focus Sash Crawdaunt teammates, as they can respectively remove and prevent entry hazards, allowing Crawdaunt to retain its Focus Sash for as long as possible. Lastly, Crawdaunt appreciates having momentum support from VoltTurn users, such as Rotom-C and Infernape, making them good teammates for it.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a very strong STAB attack that removes the held item of the opposing Pokemon. Crabhammer is a very solid STAB attack that has a high 100 Base Power. Aqua Jet gives Crawdaunt a form of priority to ensure that it is able to hit quicker Pokemon. Aerial Ace allows Crawdaunt to hit Chesnaught, which walls it otherwise, for super effective damage. Alternatively, Crunch allows Crawdaunt to do more damage with its Dark-type STAB move than it would with Knock Off to itemless Pokemon and Mega Evolutions. Switcheroo allows Crawdaunt to cripple most of its switch-ins, making it a decent option should Aerial Ace and Crunch not seem too useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band boosts Crawdaunt's Attack, making it a very powerful wallbreaker at the cost of locking it into a move. Adaptability changes Crawdaunt's STAB bonus from 1.5x to 2x, making its STAB attacks a lot stronger. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used to augment Crawdaunt's wallbreaking potential, and a Jolly nature is used to ensure Crawdaunt is able to outspeed bulky Pokemon that attempt to Speed creep it, whereas an Adamant nature can be used to ensure Crawdaunt hits as hard as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Prediction is important for Crawdaunt, as it can easily give your opponent free turns depending on the move it locks itself into; however, most Pokemon take a lot of damage from Knock Off and Crabhammer, so don't be afraid to just use either whenever you can. Crawdaunt should only be coming in on weak attacks or from pivoting into something it has a good matchup against. Crawdaunt should be making use of its wallbreaking prowess during the early game as much as possible so its teammates can have an easier time later on. Use Crawdaunt's revenge killing potential with Aqua Jet as a tool against offense, as it generally doesn't get any other opportunity to be useful in those matchups.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers and cleaners, such as Dragon Dance Gyarados and Mega Sharpedo, make for good Crawdaunt partners, as they capitalize on Crawdaunt's ability to effectively break down opposing teams. Other wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Entei and Choice Specs Kyurem, also make for good partners, as they form wallbreaking cores with Crawdaunt that can effectively break most defensively oriented teams. Entry hazard setters, such as Forretress and Nidoqueen, are good Crawdaunt partners due to their ability to wear down the opposing team via entry hazards, making Crawdaunt's switch-ins even more limited. Users of speed control moves, such as Sticky Web Shuckle and Tailwind Suicune, make for good Crawdaunt partners, as they can allow Crawdaunt to outspeed Pokemon it normally wouldn't be able to. Crawdaunt is also highly appreciative of momentum support from Volt Switch and U-turn users, such as Heliolisk and Hydreigon.</p>"

  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>While fairly overlooked in the UU metagame, Milotic serves as one of the tier's best stops to setup sweepers with its access to utility moves such as Haze and Recover as well as a great Special Defense stat and a good defensive typing in pure Water. Its typing leaves it with only two weaknesses in Grass and Electric, which can be covered fairly easily with the rest of the team. Milotic is best used on more balance-oriented teams, as it matches up well against a plethora of Pokemon commonly found on offensive teams such as Hydreigon, Mega Blastoise, Mega Aerodactyl, and Kyurem. It is also a solid check to common Fire-types such as Entei and Darmanitan, as they often Choice lock themselves into STAB moves. In addition to its defensive prowess, Milotic possesses decent offensive presence for a bulkier Pokemon, with fairly high Special Attack and Speed stats at base 100 and 81, respectively.</p> <p>However, Milotic is still quite weak to Pokemon with good coverage, is crippled by status, and lacks utility outside of Haze. While it takes on Entei and Darmanitan well, other Fire-types such as Infernape and Rotom-H have the coverage necessary to hit Milotic for super effective damage. Toxic poison and burns severely hinder Milotic's longevity, though Milotic's ability Marvel Scale boosts its physical bulk while it's statused. Milotic also does not support the rest of the team as well as many other bulky Water-types in the tier such as Swampert, Empoleon, and Tentacruel do. Milotic is good as a blanket check to many threats within the tier but remains fairly one dimensional when it comes to roles on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used over Ice Beam, but dealing with common Pokemon such as Taunt Hydreigon is much harder without the extra coverage. Competitive can be used over Marvel Scale to take advantage of Defog and Intimidate users, though Marvel Scale is generally preferred in order to take advantage of possible status conditions. Dragon Tail is an alternative to Haze, but it leaves Milotic extremely vulnerable to setup sweepers running Substitute, specifically Gyarados.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic, poison, and burns severely hinder Milotic's longevity and defensive capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Tentacruel, Seismitoad, and Empoleon do not fear Milotic and can proceed to do their respective jobs in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types including Heliolisk and Rotom-C all threaten Milotic with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Sceptile, Shaymin, and Roserade can potentially KO Milotic if brought in safely, though they must be wary of Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Guts Users</strong>: Pokemon with access to the Guts ability such as Heracross and Conkeldurr do not fear Scald or Ice Beam and can proceed to threaten Milotic out.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald serves as a consistent Water-type STAB attack with a high chance to burn the foe, aiding Milotic in taking on physical attackers. Ice Beam is a good coverage move alongside Scald, hitting Dragon-types and Grass-types such as Hydreigon and Whimsicott for super effective damage. Haze resets all stat changes on the field, which is especially useful against setup sweepers such as Gyarados, Reuniclus, Slowking, and Snorlax. Recover provides instant recovery and more longevity, allowing Milotic to remain at high amounts of health throughout the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread in conjunction with a Bold nature maximizes Milotic's physical bulk. Leftovers provides passive recovery that goes along well with Recover in keeping Milotic healthy. The ability Marvel Scale provides Milotic with a Defense boost if it is poisoned or burned, though the status ailments severely compromise its longevity. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 SpD with a Calm nature is a viable option as well, as it helps Milotic take on the special attackers of the tier, specifically guaranteeing Nidoqueen's Life Orb Sludge Wave and Alakazam's Life Orb Psychic never 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Milotic generally works best on more balanced teams as a blanket check to a variety of threats. It should be switched in to absorb hits due to its impressive bulk and solid defensive typing and should use Recover afterwards in order to remain at a high amount of HP. Milotic should primarily be brought in on setup sweepers, particularly Gyarados, to use Haze and stop them in their tracks. Do not use Milotic to absorb Toxic or burns, as the crippling residual damage generally outweighs the usefulness of the Defense boost from Marvel Scale.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Florges is a quality partner, as it can remove any status conditions that may be inflicted upon Milotic. Milotic in turn takes on many of the Fire- and Steel-types that threaten Florges. Roserade and Rotom-C are good partners, as they threaten the opposing bulky Water-types that can be annoying for Milotic to deal with. Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and Krookodile can check opposing Electric-types and also appreciate Milotic's ability to sponge Water- and Ice-type moves aimed at them. Pokemon like Entei and Crobat that threaten the Grass-types of the tier are greatly appreciated. Crobat gets a special mention, as it also checks Conkeldurr and Heracross, two common Guts users that threaten out Milotic.</p>"

  "Banette": {
    "overview": "<p>Be on the look out for this sinister foe, as the Marionette Pokemon is back with a new bag of tricks! Banette is a Pokemon that isn't easy to use. Banette's stats, aside from its Attack, are lackluster. It has very little offensive capability, and is not a threat to many Pokemon. However, Banette got a Mega Evolution in XY to help it against its new competition. Mega Banette's new ability, Prankster, allows it to take advantage of all kinds of non-damaging moves. Banette also receives a huge buff to its Attack and a slight buff to its defenses in its Mega Evolved form. Mega Banette can now lead and can cause opponents trouble with Prankster Destiny Bond. However, Mega Banette still suffers from low Speed and subpar defenses. It also has a small movepool and a lack of reliable recovery. Banette is severely outclassed by Sableye, which not only has a wider movepool but actually has access to reliable recovery, while Mega Banette suffers from having four-moveslot syndrome; usually not being able to use all the moves it wants to use and having to use move sets that are based on the moves it generally runs. Another issue with Banette is that Prankster doesn't come into effect on the turn that it Mega Evolves; Mega Banette must wait a turn for its much desired ability in order to function properly. However, Banette can still manage to scare up the competition with its newfound strength and ability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Banette can also run a number of alternative options. Mega Banette can run Trick Room to support slower team members. Not only does Mega Banette gain a speed advantage from this, having both speed and priority, but this can also be beneficial because it can stop faster sweepers in their tracks. Mega Banette can also use Confuse Ray to possibly gain some free turns. Curse can be used to force the opponent to switch out, which is great for racking up residual damage and swinging the momentum in your favor. Torment and Disable are also troublesome for the opponent, as restricting their options is always useful. Other status moves such as Toxic can be annoying as well. Protect is a very good move for ensuring that Banette can safely Mega Evolve and is also valuable for scouting out an opponent's moveset. Moves like Sucker Punch and Pain Split can also surprise opponents as well. Sucker Punch can be used as a Dark-type priority move, while Pain Split in conjunction with Substitute can slowly diminish the HP of bulky foes. Gunk Shot allows Mega Banette to take out pesky Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse. Phantom Force is another alternative choice to use, as it is a very strong STAB move. Vanishing on the first turn may also prove useful, sparing Mega Banette a turn of damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Prankster Users</strong>: Quicker Prankster users such as Whimsicott and Meowstic can cause Mega Banette problems by outspeeding it.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Mega Houndoom, Mega Absol, and Hydreigon are bad news for Mega Banette, as they are faster and stronger than it. Mega Houndoom and Mega Absol can counter Mega Banette completely with their Speed, abilities, and power. These Pokemon also have access to Dark Pulse, Knock Off, and Sucker Punch, which are red flags for Mega Banette.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Fast Fire-types such as Arcanine and Entei can check Mega Banette since it can't use Will-O-Wisp on them. While not the most ideal option, Rotom-H can also check Mega Banette, since its Electric / Fire typing allows it to absorb its two most common status moves.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Prankster": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt allows Mega Banette to stop entry hazard setters dead in their tracks, while also shutting down any offensive leads that attempt to set up. Prankster Will-O-Wisp is used to get a quick burn, crippling physical attacking foes. Alternatively, slowing threats down with Thunder Wave can help Mega Banette outspeed them and hit them with its own attacks. STAB Shadow Claw deals good damage coming off of its massive base 165 Attack, but Shadow Sneak can be used for priority and picking off weakened foes. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove a foe's item. Destiny Bond works incredibly well with Prankster; if all else fails, this is your kill switch. Frisk allows you to scout for items such as Focus Sash, Assault Vest, and Leftovers that Knock Off can remove.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs are invested in HP since Mega Banette needs to be able to take a hit to make up for its low Speed and frail defenses, while 252 Attack EVs allow it to hit relatively hard. Running Frisk on Banette allows you to scout out the opponent's items to get a sense of what they're planning: finding items such as Berries, Choice items, and Focus Sashes will give you an idea of how the opponent will use that Pokemon. Banettite is the best item for Banette; not only does Banette get a 100-point boost to its base stat total, but it also gains the much needed Prankster, which is the only reason that Mega Banette is viable in the first place. Lastly, Mega Banette will want to run an Adamant nature to ensure that it can take full advantage of its newfound Attack without sacrificing Speed or bulk. An alternate spread of 148 HP / 252 Atk / 108 Spe can be used in order to allow Banette to outspeed Pokemon like Suicune and effectively spinblock against Blastoise, granted that the opponent doesn't predict the switch in. However, this spread reduces Banette's overall bulk, so it should be used to remove Blastoise if hazard blocking is necessary for your team's success.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Banette doesn't gain Prankster on its first turn, so try to Mega Evolve it as soon as possible. Mega Banette works well mid-game, when it can whittle down the opponent's team with Will-O-Wisp. Use Taunt on the foe to prevent them from setting up when they predict you to use Destiny Bond or Will-O-Wisp. Prankster Destiny Bond allows you to instantly shut down a sweep only once, so use this wisely. However, most of the time Destiny Bond is obvious, so it's always important to figure out when to use it, since it's sometimes difficult to determine whether an opponent will attack, use a status move, or set up. Avoid wasting Destiny Bond on weakened Pokemon; conserve it to get rid of stronger foes. Using status moves and switching out can be great for allowing bulkier teammates to set up on burned or Taunted Pokemon, so burning or paralyzing a foe and then making a switch can really put pressure on an opponent while giving you the edge.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its limited movepool, Mega Banette can't provide its teammates with too much help, so it relies more on its team members instead. Mega Banette is vulnerable to Dark-types, so having bulkier teammates like Cobalion or hard-hitting teammates like Lucario to take a Knock Off is appreciated; not only can it benefit them if they have the Justified ability, but it can also get Mega Banette out of difficult situations. Other good teammates that can take hits are Florges and Umbreon, as they both resist Dark-type moves. Florges has great Special Defense, while Umbreon can take both physical and special attacks nicely. Florges and Umbreon can also provide support for Banette with Wish and Heal Bell / Aromatherapy in case you want Mega Banette to last longer and wreak more havoc.</p>"

Magic Bounce further strengthens its offensive presence by bouncing Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and even Stealth Rock back at the opponent, frustrating lead Pokemon such as Froslass. However, Mega Absol's immense frailty means that it struggles to take even neutral hits, making it nearly impossible to switch into attacks. It also has poor Speed before Mega Evolving, meaning it is forced to use Sucker Punch on faster threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Protect allows Absol to Mega Evolve safely, but Mega Absol will miss the coverage or power provided by other moves. Iron Tail can be used on a Swords Dance set to hit Pokemon such as Sylveon, although the 75% accuracy is a huge downfall. Mixed Mega Absol with Fire Blast to hit Forretress and Chesnaught is an option if the rest of your team has trouble with them. Will-O-Wisp is a nice lure that can burn common switch-ins such as Cobalion and Mega Swampert.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Aggron</strong>: Mega Aggron can easily tank any move other than Fire Blast, which doesn't even do much, and has a large chance to OHKO back with Heavy Slam.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Dedicated physical walls such as Suicune, Rhyperior, Swampert, and Chesnaught can take hits relatively well. Suicune and Swampert can fish for Scald burns, while Chesnaught OHKOs with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats that have enough bulk to survive a Sucker Punch, such as Crobat, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon can take advantage of Mega Absol's mediocre bulk.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Florges and Sylveon resist Mega Absol's STAB moves and take little from any move outside of Iron Tail. Most have a good chance to OHKO with their strong Fairy-type STAB.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Machamp and Cobalion can reasonably take an unboosted Play Rough or Superpower and dish out powerful Fighting-type moves to OHKO Mega Absol.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Absol's Attack to crazy levels and works great in combination with Mega Absol's ability, which bounces back moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Knock Off is a powerful STAB attack that also removes its target's item. Sucker Punch is powerful priority against Pokemon that can outspeed Mega Absol, and it usually grants a safe turn to Mega Evolve against faster threats. Superpower provides good coverage alongside Knock Off and allows Mega Absol to hit Dark-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Krookodile, while also allowing Mega Absol to beat Cobalion. However, Superpower leaves Mega Absol walled by Fairy-type Pokemon such as Sylveon. Play Rough is another option to hit Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Chesnaught, super effectively, but is considerably weaker than Superpower.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The 4 Special Defense EVs give common Download users an Attack boost instead of a Special Attack boost. 252 Attack EVs maximize Mega Absol's damage output, while maximum Speed is used to Speed tie with other base 115 Speed Pokemon. An Absolite is the only item you want to equip, as non-Mega Absol is unviable in UU. Justified can be used to let Absol switch into weak Dark-type moves before Mega Evolving to get a free Attack boost. An Adamant nature can be used for a slight power increase, but Jolly is the preferred nature to outspeed Pokemon such as Froslass and Infernape after Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not be reckless switching Mega Absol into attacks. It is extremely frail and can't take many hits, sometimes even resisted ones, especially if there are entry hazards up. Mega Absol does, however, have plenty of free switch opportunities to defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, because most of them fear Knock Off and Magic Bounce, which gives Absol a free turn of setup. However, Mega Absol is best used for late-game cleaning, once its checks and counters have taken prior damage. Before Mega Evolving, Absol can switch into a predicted weak Dark-type attack, such as Knock Off, as the damage is reduced when the target is holding a Mega Stone, to get a free Attack boost due to Justified. Very few things are safe switch-ins to Mega Absol at +2 or even +1 thanks to its massive Attack stat, so finding opportunities to set up are a must.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Absol appreciates the extra damage entry hazards give foes when it is attempting to sweep, so Stealth Rock setters such as Forretress, which also handles Florges, Sylveon, and Mega Aggron, are decent choices. Roserade is a good teammate that can handle Sylveon, one of Mega Absol's biggest checks, and can cripple other switch-ins with Sleep Powder. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Rotom-H and Mienshao, can provide good opportunities for Mega Absol to come in safely and get up a Swords Dance.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Absol's primary STAB move, dealing massive damage and crippling potential switch-ins by removing their items. Sucker Punch gives Absol a form of priority, allowing it to easily pick off weakened targets and OHKO Mega Beedrill. Pursuit traps Psychic-types such as Celebi and Bronzong, while Iron Tail can be used to lure in Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Whimsicott and hit them hard. Superpower heavily damages Pokemon like Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Cobalion, which otherwise wall Absol. Fire Blast can be used in the last moveslot with a Naive nature to hit Cobalion, Forretress, and Whimsicott, but using it means losing out on hitting Hydreigon and Krookodile.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible and maximum Speed investment coupled with a Jolly nature allows Absol to outspeed threats such as Cobalion, Heliolisk, and Tornadus. Justified nets Absol an Attack boost when it absorbs a Dark-type attack. Absolite is used to allow Absol to Mega Evolve.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to take advantage of Pokemon fearing Knock Off, such as Bronzong, to Mega Evolve Absol safely. Alternatively, try to Mega Evolve it on Pokemon threatened by Sucker Punch such as Mega Beedrill and weakened Crobat. Using Knock Off, Pursuit, or a coverage move on such Pokemon may be worth the risk, as Sucker Punch failing loses momentum. Use Pursuit to support Mega Absol's teammates; Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Celebi, Reuniclus, and Chandelure will be caught off guard by Pursuit due to the popularity of the Swords Dance set. Superpower needs some chip damage to KO Cobalion and Krookodile, while even a healthy Hydreigon is OHKOed most of the time by Superpower; however, be wary of Choice Scarf sets. Fairy-types can be 2HKOed with Iron Tail if you predict their switch in. However, Knock Off is always a safe play, as Fairy-types are also inconvenienced by losing their item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits best on offensive teams that can take advantage of its utility, as Absol's teammates can pivot it in safely and deal with the bulky Water-types and other defensive Pokemon that completely wall it. Fighting-types such as Heracross, Toxicroak, and Conkeldurr appreciate Mega Absol dealing with Psychic-types such as Celebi and Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Whimsicott, making them excellent partners. Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Cresselia benefit from the removal of Dark-type threats such as Krookodile and Hydreigon. Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Whimsicott are also good partners, profiting from Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Forretress being weakened. Mega Absol is weak to Bug-, Fairy-, and Fighting-types such as Heracross, Sylveon, and Mienshao, so Poison-types such as Crobat and Nidoqueen make for great partners, as they can help alleviate those weaknesses.</p>"

Mega Glalie's base 120 Attack might not look too impressive by UnderUsed standards, but thanks to Refrigerate, it becomes a huge threat, boosting the power of moves such as Double-Edge and Explosion to really high levels. However, Mega Glalie still has some prominent flaws. Ice is terrible defensively, as it comes with weaknesses to Fighting-, Fire-, Rock-, and Steel-type attacks, all of which are common in the current metagame. Also, Mega Glalie lacks the movepool to show some versatility, making it very predictable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used over Double-Edge or Return, because the 30% chance of paralysis allows Mega Glalie to cripple some offensive threats. Hidden Power Fire hits Forretress and Escavalier, but it makes Mega Glalie lose one point in Speed and costs a valuable moveslot. Facade helps Mega Glalie deal with Scald burns, however it is extremely situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist Mega Glalie's STAB move and Earthquake does not help against some of them, such as Forretress and Mega Aggron. However, the combination of Super Fang and Explosion does 79% minimum to standard Mega Aggron, which means Mega Glalie can possibly cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Without Freeze-Dry, Mega Glalie struggles against bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Jellicent, without resorting to Super Fang and Explosion. Additionally, these Pokemon usually carry a recovery move, meaning they can heal up the turn Mega Glalie explodes. However, Freeze-Dry does respectable damage and may threaten the 2HKO if the bulky Water-type is even slightly weakened.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Base 100 Speed isn't bad, but it isn't anything special either. Faster Pokemon that aren't OHKOed by Ice Shard, such as Infernape and Mienshao, can revenge kill Mega Glalie.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users can revenge kill Mega Glalie as long as Ice Shard doesn't OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: A Stealth Rock weakness, lack of immunities and resistances, and Double-Edge recoil make Mega Glalie fairly easy to wear down.</p> <p><strong>Capitalizing on Explosion</strong>: More often than not, Mega Glalie is going to be forced to use Explosion to hurt the foe's team, which removes it from the game. The issue with this is that only a handful Pokemon can tank Explosion and nothing in the tier can switch into Mega Glalie without any risk, thanks to its other moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Strong Priority is an efficient way of taking down Glalie as Extreme Speed from Entei and Mach Punch from Conkeldurr can easily take care of Glalie with prior damage.</p>",

Super Fang has no immunities thanks to Refrigerate, so Mega Glalie is capable of crippling all of its checks and counters, and in some cases break through them with the combination of Super Fang and Explosion. Earthquake hits Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon, such as Empoleon and Infernape, for super effective damage. Freeze-Dry threatens bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, without reliance on Super Fang and Explosion. Ice Shard makes Mega Glalie harder to revenge kill, because it threatens faster Pokemon such as Crobat, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Beedrill. Taunt shuts down some defensive Pokemon, and works really well with Super Fang. Also, Spikes can take advantage of the amount of switches Mega Glalie causes and its ability to punish Defog and Rapid Spin users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Mega Glalie's Speed and power. A Naive nature is needed to outspeed important threats such as Roserade, Hydreigon, and Haxorus, and to Speed tie with base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Shaymin. Sets without Freeze-Dry should run 4 SpD EVs, as this prevents Download users from getting a Special Attack boost, and Jolly nature instead of Naive.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Glalie usually doesn't survive during an entire game, as its main role is to break or cripple walls early- or mid-game. If Mega Glalie needs to use Explosion to remove a important threat, don't hesitate on sacrificing it. Using its main STAB move first is usually the best option; however, Super Fang and Freeze-Dry can punish possible switch-ins if you predict right. Mega Glalie might be able to set up Spikes in many occasions, but this doesn't mean it should be used just to fulfill the role of an entry hazard setter, because there are dedicated Spikes users that can do that better and it is a waste of Mega Glalie's power.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Glalie appreciates teammates that can control entry hazards on the field. Rapid Spin and Defog users, such as Donphan and Crobat, help mitigate Mega Glalie's Stealth Rock weakness. Entry hazards help Mega Glalie wear down walls, which makes Pokemon such as Swampert and Chesnaught good teammates. However, if Mega Glalie is running Spikes, there's no need for another user of that move. Pokemon capable of dealing with bulky Steel-type Pokemon, such as Suicune and the aforementioned Swampert, are needed because Mega Glalie struggles to break through them without significant previous damage. Sweepers that enjoy walls such as Mega Aggron, Forretress, and Suicune being weakened or removed from the game are great to run alongside Mega Glalie; examples include Haxorus, Darmanitan, and Kingdra.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Metagross is a unique Pokemon in UU thanks to its Steel / Psychic typing that lets it check Psychic-, Rock-, Fairy-, and Flying-types, its excellent Attack, and its hard-hitting STAB moves. Unfortunately, its low base 70 Speed means it can struggle against other offensive Pokemon, such as Mamoswine and Cobalion, and it finds itself checked by the bulky and omnipresent Ground- and Water-types in the tier. It also faces heavy competition from Cobalion, which has higher Speed, a Dark resistance, and access to moves like Swords Dance that makes it easier to fit on most teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Pursuit might seem like an appealing option for Metagross at first, as it can Pursuit trap Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and take them down or do severe damage to them. It could also cause mind games with Bullet Punch + Pursuit for Gardevoir, but the reality is that with Metagross's four-moveslot syndrome, it has no room for Pursuit, and there are better users of the move, such as Doublade and Escavalier. Thunder Punch is an option to hit bulky Water-types, notably Gyarados, for good damage, but Zen Headbutt, which also hits bulky Water-types, somewhat outclasses it. A mixed set with Grass Knot and Hidden Power Fire can lure some of Metagross's common counters, such as Swampert, Doublade and Forretress, but is less generally useful than the other sets. Ice Punch hits bulky Ground-types like Gligar for big damage, but it's usually inferior to Metagross's other coverage options due to not hitting Swampert or other bulky Ground-types on their weaker Special Defense side. An Agility set can have some use as a late-game cleaner, but Metagross then suffers from being unable to break through bulky Water-types and other defensive walls. An Assault Vest set might seem appealing due to its special bulk, letting it check threats like Sylveon, but it takes away the utility of Stealth Rock and isn't very powerful. It also can get worn down quickly by hazards and constantly switching in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types are reliable Metagross checks, as they resist Meteor Mash and their good Defense allows them to take Zen Headbutt or Earthquake well. However, they have to watch out for Thunder Punch, and Swampert needs to look out for Grass Knot as well; additionally, a Choice Band-boosted Explosion can do a ton of damage to them. Jellicent only has to fear Choice Band Zen Headbutt, and Alomomola can take an Explosion and heal the damage off due to Regenerator, only being really crippled by Trick. Suicune can take any of Metagross's moves and potentially set up Calm Minds on it, and it can heal the damage off as well. Slowking resists both of Metagross's STAB moves and has Regenerator to repeatedly switch in, but it fears taking an Explosion due to its low physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types like Gligar and Donphan can switch into Metagross due to their high Defense and proceed to set up Stealth Rock or hit Metagross with a super effective Earthquake. They do have to watch out for Grass Knot variants, especially in Swampert's case, and Mamoswine is not a check due to being KOed by Meteor Mash or being picked off by Bullet Punch and is checked by Shuca Berry variants of Metagross. Explosion also does a ton to them and prevents Gligar and Donphan from clearing hazards.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types like Cobalion and Mega Aggron can switch into Metagross's STAB moves and set up Stealth Rock on it, hit Metagross, or cripple it with Thunder Wave in Mega Aggron's case. While Metagross can hit them with Earthquake, Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix are bulky enough to scoff it off, and Cobalion commonly runs Shuca Berry as well. Forretress doesn't take much from Earthquake and can Rapid Spin Metagross's hazards away, only having to fear Hidden Power Fire variants.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Entei threaten Metagross immensely with their STAB moves being able to KO Metagross easily, but they do have to fear for Earthquake on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Like Fire-types, Dark-types like Mega Absol threaten Metagross with their STAB moves, but they have to watch out for Colbur Berry variants. Most of them cannot switch into Metagross due to its power, but they can revenge kill it easily.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is an essential move on all competitive teams, and Metagross makes good use of it, as it threatens many spinners and Defoggers, such as Tentacruel and Empoleon. Meteor Mash is Metagross's main STAB attack, giving it decent neutral coverage against a large amount of the tier as well as hitting Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl and Fairy-types like Florges for super effective damage. Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Empoleon for decent damage and provides good coverage alongside Meteor Mash. Explosion is a good option in the last slot that makes Metagross go out with a bang, notably hitting bulky Water-types hard and preventing hazard removers like Tentacruel from removing Stealth Rock. Zen Headbutt can be used over Explosion as a secondary STAB move that hits bulky Water-types neutrally and hits Fighting- and Poison-types such as Tentacruel and Machamp for super effective damage. However, it doesn't hit as hard as Explosion. Bullet Punch is an option in the last slot in order to pick off or revenge kill weakened and frail threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill. It's also very useful to pick off a weakened Slurpuff and avoid taking damage from Drain Punch. Hammer Arm is an option on sets that utilize Colbur Berry to lure in Hydreigon and Krookodile and hit them for great damage, but the move leaves Metagross walled by Doublade and lowers its Speed stat, making it extremely slow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs augment Metagross's offensive potential and maximum Speed investment helps Metagross more safely outspeed faster Suicune variants while also letting Metagross outspeed Jolly Crawdaunt and Nidoqueen. Life Orb makes Metagross very powerful, which is useful to boost up Explosion's power against bulky Water-types, but the recoil damage can wear it down quickly. Shuca Berry is a good option, making Metagross a one-time check to the likes of Mamoswine and helping against Earthquake Mega Aerodactyl. Lum Berry works well with Explosion, helping Metagross prevent the burn from Scald users like Suicune so that it can use Explosion on them, but it means Metagross lacks the power of a Life Orb-boosted Explosion. Colbur Berry is a decent alternative item, helping Metagross out in the matchup versus Dark-types like Mega Absol, and it also prevents Metagross from being revenge killed by Sucker Punch users and Pursuit users. However, it isn't as effective as Shuca Berry due to some Dark-types, like Krookodile and Mega Houndoom, having a secondary STAB move that hits Metagross hard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Metagross should be switched in on Pokemon it checks, such as Fairy-types like Sylveon and Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl, and should set up Stealth Rock on the forced switch to support its team. Once it has set up Stealth Rock, Metagross can proceed to attack the opposing team with its powerful moves before finishing off with Explosion when its done punching through walls; mainly hitting bulky Water-types.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Metagross fits best on offensive teams, as bulkier teams prefer a more reliable Stealth Rock setter. Therefore, more offensive teammates like Mienshao and offensive Roserade are preferred over defensive ones. Teammates that appreciate having a check to Mega Aerodactyl or Florges, such as Mega Sceptile and Heliolisk, make for good partners to Metagross because they are checked by both of these Pokemon. Teammates that can handle bulky Water-types, such as Grass-types like Roserade or Pokemon with Water Absorb or Dry Skin like Toxicroak, make for good partners if Metagross is not running Explosion, but they are still useful because Metagross can only use Explosion once. Metagross can't do much to Forretress, which can just set up entry hazards in front of Metagross; hazard removers that can beat Forretress like Tentacruel and Mega Blastoise are appreciated to help out this problem. Hydreigon is one of the best Metagross partners, as Metagross both takes care of Hydreigon's Fairy weakness and appreciates Hydreigon being able to resist all the types that Metagross is weak to. If Metagross runs Explosion, teammates that can appreciate Metagross crippling bulky Water-types with Explosion, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Mienshao, can make for good partners. These teammates can also help out against offensive teams, a playstyle that Metagross can have trouble keeping up with.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash hits quite hard with a Choice Band equipped and possesses a chance to raise Metagross's Attack. Earthquake is important to hit Steel-types like Cobalion and Empoleon for decent damage. Zen Headbutt hits bulky Water-types like Jellicent and Milotic for good damage and hits Fighting- and Poison-types hard. Explosion lets Metagross go out with a bang, dealing huge damage to Pokemon that don't resist it. It also lets a teammate switch in safely without sacrificing momentum. Trick is a decent option over Explosion, letting Metagross cripple switch-ins such as Suicune by Tricking them a Choice Band. Bullet Punch can pick off and revenge kill fast or frail attackers like Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl and can also stop a Slurpuff sweep. However, it isn't the best move to be locked into and doesn't have the wallbreaking utility that Trick or Explosion has.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with a Choice Band makes Metagross a very powerful wallbreaker. Maximum Speed investment lets Metagross outspeed all relevant walls and Speed tie with other neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon; this also allows it to outspeed threats such as Jolly Crawdaunt. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Mamoswine and OHKO it. However, Jolly Mamoswine—the most common variant of Mamoswine—still outspeeds and OHKOes Metagross, so it's usually not worth it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Metagross should be played as a wallbreaker, breaking apart bulky Pokemon with its STAB moves and coverage. This set fits well on offensive teams that want a wallbreaker with some defensive utility in checking Mega Aerodactyl and Fairy-types. This variant of Metagross is a bit reliant on prediction, as none of its moves are the best to be locked into, especially if the foe resists them. Explosion is a great move to use if Metagross is weakened or if it doesn't have much of a use in the game, letting Metagross do massive damage to a Pokemon that doesn't resist it and let another teammate switch in safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Volt Switch and U-Turn users such as Heliolisk and Hydreigon synergize well with Choice Band Metagross, as Metagross likes to switch in safely; they also appreciate Metagross breaking down their checks and counters with Choice Band-boosted attacks. While this set has an easier time against bulky Water-types due to the power of Choice Band and Explosion, Metagross still wants an answer to them, so Pokemon that can check these Water-types such as Toxicroak and Heliolisk partner up well with Metagross. Fast cleaners such as Mega Aerodactyl appreciate Metagross wearing down their checks and counters, and Mega Aerodactyl also can act as a soft Fire-type check if it runs Roost.</p>"

  "Registeel": {
    "overview": "<p>While Registeel is often overlooked in favor of other bulky Steel-types, such as Mega Aggron, which has a much greater offensive presence and access to Filter, and Bronzong, which has Levitate and takes neutral damage from Fighting-type moves, it still has several things going for it that make it a viable option. Registeel boasts incredible 80 / 150 / 150 bulk and a pure Steel typing that grants it important resistances to Dragon, Fairy, Rock, Flying, and Grass, as well as an immunity to Poison. These attributes make it a great check to some of UU's most powerful threats, such as Hydreigon, Venomoth, Kyurem, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, Shaymin, Crobat, and Porygon-Z. Registeel is also a very reliable Stealth Rock user and, unlike Mega Aggron, can hold Leftovers, has a phenomenal Special Defense stat, and doesn't take up your team's Mega slot. However, Registeel has little offensive capabilities due to its low Attack stat, unless it uses Curse. Therefore, it should only be used on very defensive or stall teams. No access to instant recovery also means that Registeel is prone to being worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Curse + RestTalk set can be utilized to keep Registeel healthy and potentially sweep teams after a few boosts, but such a set is better suited to Mega Aggron. Ice Punch hits Mega Sceptile hard but has little use otherwise. Counter can be used to surprise physical attackers and works well with Registeel's titanic defenses, as it can take almost any super effective physical hit from full health.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Nidoqueen, Mega Swampert, and Krookodile are immune to Thunder Wave and can destroy Registeel with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Fighting-types</strong>: No Guard Machamp, Mienshao, Entei, Chandelure, and Infernape can easily KO Registeel with their STAB moves, but they need to watch out for Thunder Wave and Toxic. Fire-types are also hit reasonably hard by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Due to Registeel's lack of offensive prowess, Taunt users such as Jellicent, Hydreigon, and Mandibuzz shut it down almost completely and can wear it down easily.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Registeel is setup fodder for bulky sweepers such as Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Reuniclus, Curse Snorlax, Substitute Feraligatr, and Swords Dance Cobalion, although ones lacking Rest need to watch out for Thunder Wave and Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock provides valuable support for any team, and Registeel can set it up very reliably. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple many offensive threats and works well with Registeel's great bulk. Alternatively, Toxic nails bulky walls such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and Swampert, which Registeel can barely scratch otherwise. Iron Head hits Fairy-, Ice-, and Rock-types for decent damage and allows Registeel to potentially abuse the flinch chance in conjunction with Thunder Wave paralysis. Seismic Toss can be used instead to inflict consistent damage on most Pokemon, making up for Registeel's lack of power. Protect accumulates additional Leftovers recovery and lets Registeel scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Darmanitan and Mienshao. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used to hit certain Pokemon, such as Entei and Nidoqueen, super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An EV spread of Max HP and Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature allows Registeel to reliably counter various special attackers in the tier, such as Hydreigon, Venomoth, Porygon-Z, Shaymin, Kyurem, and Dragalge. Leftovers increases Registeel's longevity. Alternatively, 252 Defense EVs and 4 Special Defense EVs can be used to tank hits better from the likes of Feraligatr and Mega Beedrill; however, Registeel's typing is better suited for walling special attackers rather than physical ones due to its weaknesses to common physical moves such as Earthquake and Close Combat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Utilize Registeel's great resistances and bulk to switch it in and set up Stealth Rock or to counter the many threatening special attackers in UU. The choice between Thunder Wave and Toxic comes down to whether it is more important for your team to neutralize offensive threats or break down opposing walls. This set should only really be used on very defensive teams due to its lack of offensive presence. If you want a bulky Steel-type to use on a balanced or offensive team, you are usually better off using Cobalion or Mega Aggron, which, unlike Registeel, will not completely kill your team's momentum.</p> <p>Make sure that you take advantage of Registeel's unique attributes, those being its monstrous Special Defense stat, access to Leftovers, and pure Steel typing, as otherwise you're better off using Mega Aggron, Forretress, or Bronzong. For instance, unlike other bulky Steel-types, Registeel has sufficient special bulk to reliably counter even the most fearsome special sweepers in UU, such as Quiver Dance Venomoth, Nasty Plot Porygon-Z, and Choice Specs Kyurem.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish support is much appreciated because Registeel can otherwise be easily worn down with repeated hits. Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Florges, and Aromatisse are great partners for their ability to take Fighting-type attacks directed at Registeel, while Registeel can absorb Poison- and Steel-type attacks directed at them in return. Alomomola can also pass massive Wishes to Registeel while synergizing well with it defensively. Other physically bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Slowking, also make for good partners because, in tandem with Registeel, they wall a huge portion of the tier. Pokemon that resist attacks that Registeel is weak to, such as Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Crobat, all make for decent teammates too.</p> <p>Due to its lack of power, Registeel is setup fodder for bulky sweepers such as Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Reuniclus, Curse Snorlax, Substitute Feraligatr, and Swords Dance Cobalion, so be sure to pair it with a phazer or a revenge killer that can deal with these threats. Pokemon such as Suicune, Slowking, Swampert, and Choice Scarf Mienshao can all fulfill this role. Whimsicott can also utilize its priority Encore to lock setup sweepers into a useless move.</p>"

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>When compared to other Fire-type Pokemon in UU, Infernape has no issue standing out, being the only one in the tier to possess a secondary Fighting typing, which offers excellent coverage and a neutrality to Stealth Rock. Infernape boasts equal 104 / 104 offenses, complemented by an offensive movepool with matchless versatility, featuring even priority moves such as Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, making it very difficult for the opponent to predict what Infernape is going to do.</p> <p>However, the plethora of options at Infernape's disposal can be viewed as a weakness, as it often suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, meaning certain Pokemon will always check it based on its choices. Coupled with its poor defenses and exploitable typing, Infernape can have trouble switching in and taking strong hits, so it must be played carefully to be used to full effect.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Infernape has a plethora of alternative options in its huge movepool, though many do not work as well because they are outclassed by Infernape's primary options or unsuitable for Infernape to use due to its lack of bulk. An offensive set with Stealth Rock and three attacking moves can be used; check the lead and all-out attacker sets to determine which attacks are appropriate for your team. A set with Substitute and three attacks can be used as well, though Crobat is still capable of revenge killing Infernape due to Infiltrator, and Infernape loses both coverage and the ability to run a boosting move in order to use Substitute. An offensive set using a Choice Band can be used, though it is outclassed by Entei in this role. Fake Out can be used as a form of fast priority, though it can make Infernape predictable after using the move. Infernape boasts useful support moves, such as Encore, Will-O-Wisp, Slack Off, Torment, and Roar, though Infernape is too frail to take full advantage of them, and it might as well be used as an attacker. Lesser setup moves such as Power-Up Punch, Hone Claws, Bulk Up, Work Up, and Calm Mind are also available, though all except Work Up are truly outclassed by Swords Dance and Nasty Plot. Punishment can be used to allow Infernape to revenge kill a slower boosting sweeper, namely Reuniclus or Cresselia, in an emergency, though the move lacks STAB, does pittance to Suicune and Snorlax, and requires that the foe has acquired numerous boosts before actually being useful. Finally, Flame Charge is an option to finish off a weakened foe and simultaneously boost Infernape's Speed to give it a great chance of sweeping offensive teams with its awesome power and coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat are able to easily KO Infernape with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Alomomola are able to deal serious damage to Infernape with Scald, though they must be wary of being 2HKOed by a +2 Grass Knot from the Nasty Plot set and must be healthy enough to take a +2 Close Combat from the Swords Dance set in order to check Infernape. Tentacruel, Slowking, and Jellicent, however, all resist both of Infernape's STAB types, so if Infernape lacks the appropriate coverage move, they can serve as counters to it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types such as Gligar, Nidoqueen, Swampert, and Donphan can KO Infernape with their Ground-type STAB moves. Gligar is the closest one of these to being a counter if it runs Special Defense investment, fearing neither the Nasty Plot nor the Swords Dance sets and only losing to Infernape if it hits Gligar with the rare Hidden Power Ice on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types can give Infernape issues, as Espeon can outrun and KO it with Psyshock or Psychic, while Cresselia and Reuniclus are bulky enough to sponge hits from any physical sets and proceed to set up. While Cresselia is also able to counter the Nasty Plot set, Reuniclus is 2HKOed by Life Orb Fire Blast, so it has to be cautious trying to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Extreme Speed Users</strong>: Arcanine, Entei, and Lucario all have access to Extreme Speed and can deal serious damage to Infernape, outpacing even sets carrying their own priority moves and picking Infernape off if it has taken enough prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Infernape gets worn down badly by Life Orb, as well as recoil from Flare Blitz. Any additional damage from Stealth Rock, Spikes, or even Toxic Spikes will severely inhibit Infernape's longevity in a match.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Infernape's poor 76 / 71 / 71 bulk renders it unable to deal with taking too many hits, even resisted hits from offensive Pokemon, such as Fire Blast from Chandelure. This makes Infernape very easy to revenge kill and even harder to bring in without support from U-turn or Volt Switch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Infernape to function as a boosting sweeper that can muscle past even some of the sturdier defensive Pokemon in the tier. Fire Blast is Infernape's strongest Fire-type STAB move that is bolstered by Nasty Plot. While it seems odd to run a physical move on a Nasty Plot sweeper, Close Combat allows Infernape to play as a wallbreaker, muscling through Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon, all of which would otherwise stop Infernape flat. However, if these Pokemon are not a concern, Vacuum Wave can be used to fulfill Infernape's role as a sweeper, giving it a useful priority move against faster threats. Lastly, Grass Knot allows Infernape to break through bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Suicune, and Vaporeon after a boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the necessary item for this set, as it maximizes Infernape's damage output. The given EV spread allows Infernape to always OHKO 252 / 252 Bold Blissey while still having a fairly high chance of OHKOing Umbreon as well. A Naive nature with full Speed investment maximizes Infernape's Speed, capitalizing on its excellent base 108 Speed while allowing it to perform as a mixed attacker. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to bolster the power of Infernape's special moves. If Vacuum Wave is used, use an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature to make Infernape a full special sweeper. Lastly, an alternate EV spread of 76 Atk / 180 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature can be used to give Infernape more Special Attack while letting it OHKO Umbreon after Stealth Rock and still have a fairly high chance of OHKOing Blissey.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Take advantage of Infernape's ability to threaten numerous offensive and defensive Pokemon early-game with its amazing Speed and coverage, setting up mid-game once an opportunity is presented. Given how frail Infernape is, it can be difficult to find many opportunities to set up Nasty Plot against a Pokemon that stays in, so capitalize on using the move when Infernape is able to force a switch; after a boost, Infernape can handle the majority of defensive Pokemon in the tier. While this set functions as a boosting sweeper, it primarily functions as a wallbreaker, doing more work breaking through defensive Pokemon after a boost for another sweeper to clean up afterward. If running Vacuum Wave, Infernape should be treated as the team's designated sweeper, only attempting to use Nasty Plot once faster Pokemon that can survive a +2 Vacuum Wave have been removed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special attackers such as Mega Blastoise, Heliolisk, Hydreigon, and Nidoking partner well with Infernape, as they all appreciate this set's ability to plow through special walls. Physical attackers such as Mega Beedrill, Krookodile, Mienshao, and Mega Swampert also work well with this set, as Infernape can lure in and eliminate bulky Water-types for them. Pokemon such as Chesnaught, Roserade, Froslass, Forretress, Metagross, Nidoqueen, and Swampert can provide entry hazards to allow Infernape and its offensive teammates to break down the opposing team more easily. Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Abomasnow, Mega Ampharos, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Empoleon also partner well with this set, as they can check the faster Flying-type Pokemon that threaten Infernape.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The choice between which of Infernape's Fire-type STAB moves to use is dependent on what you would like Infernape to deal with. Fire Blast lacks the painful recoil Flare Blitz has and deals much more damage to Mega Aggron, Aromatisse, and Granbull. Flare Blitz, however, has perfect accuracy, is bolstered by Infernape's more heavily invested Attack stat, and allows Infernape to break through Florges. Close Combat is Infernape's strongest and most reliable Fighting-type STAB move and is a must on this set to beat Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon. Grass Knot allows Infernape to deal serious damage to Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert, which would otherwise stop this set flat in its tracks. Earthquake hits Tentacruel, Nidoqueen, and Mega Ampharos harder than any of Infernape's other options and also hits Chandelure. Stone Edge also covers Chandelure and is a stronger option against Entei and Rotom-H, but it also allows Infernape to hit Flying-types such as Mega Aerodactyl, Crobat, and Noivern trying to switch in on one of Infernape's STAB moves. Mach Punch is a useful priority move, allowing Infernape to pick off some faster threats, such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon. U-turn can be used to allow Infernape to get momentum, but it should only be used if running a VoltTurn team, as Life Orb recoil and entry hazards wear Infernape down badly enough already. Lastly, Hidden Power Ice allows Infernape to heavily damage to Gligar and Nidoqueen.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread listed allows Infernape to 2HKO Suicune with Grass Knot after Stealth Rock damage while maximizing Speed, with the remaining EVs placed into Attack to bolster the power of Infernape's physical moves. A Naive nature allows Infernape to function as a mixed attacker while maximizing Speed, and lets Infernape take priority moves a bit better than it would if it were using a Hasty nature. However, a Hasty nature can be used to allow Infernape to take resisted special attacks, such as Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, a bit more easily. Blaze is the preferred ability, as Iron Fist is useless on this set unless Mach Punch is used. Life Orb allows Infernape to deal as much damage as possible while switching moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set takes full advantage of Infernape's broad coverage that allows it to hit as many Pokemon as possible, so tailor the moves to cover any defensive Pokemon your team has trouble with. Infernape can serve as a lure for certain Pokemon; bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert can be caught off-guard by Grass Knot, while Tentacruel can be beaten by Earthquake. Damage from Life Orb recoil and entry hazards will wear Infernape down gradually, so bring Infernape in when it can wreak as much havoc as possible and make every move count. Infernape's great Speed and offensive presence allow it to also function as a cleaner against offensive teams late-game, and Mach Punch allows Infernape to excel in this role. Even though Infernape is a mixed wallbreaker, certain defensive Pokemon will stop it no matter what moves it uses; Arcanine, Alomomola, Cresselia, and Gligar are roadblocks for Infernape that should be left up to teammates. Rocky Helmet variants of the former two Pokemon are especially bothersome for Infernape, as they can wear Infernape down even more easily just by switching in on it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Infernape can serve as a lure for bulky Water-types, Pokemon that appreciate them removed, such as Mienshao, Krookodile, Mega Beedrill, Mega Swampert, Mega Absol, Mega Aerodactyl, Lucario, and Feraligatr, can be paired with it to form an offensive core. Pokemon that have access to entry hazards, such as Froslass, Swampert, Forretress, Chesnaught, Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Empoleon, can support Infernape by making it easier to wear Pokemon down. If Infernape forgoes Earthquake and Stone Edge in order to use Mach Punch, partners to deal with Chandelure as well as Tentacruel, Noivern, Crobat, and Mega Aerodactyl are a necessity. Mega Aerodactyl, Doublade, Empoleon, Krookodile, and Suicune are a few examples of partners that can check most of these Pokemon for Infernape.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat serves as Infernape's main STAB move. In tandem with Choice Band, it allows Infernape to threaten a majority of the tier and punish bulky Water-types such as Milotic or a slightly weakened Suicune trying to switch in. Flare Blitz is an excellent secondary STAB move that hits Poison-, Flying- and Fairy-types such as Crobat and Sylveon, which resist Fighting, hard. Mach Punch gives Infernape the ability to pick off weakened threats such as Mega Sceptile and Mega Aerodactyl. Only a little bit of prior chip damage is necessary for Mach Punch to KO Hydreigon, and it is likely to OHKO Mega Sharpedo. U-turn allows Infernape to bait in and chip down answers such as Chandelure, Gyarados, and Tentacruel. Earthquake can be used over Mach Punch to lure in and remove Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Arcanine.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Iron Fist is the ability of choice because it boosts Mach Punch's power. Blaze is used with Earthquake, as Iron Fist would do nothing and a Blaze-boosted Flare Blitz can be helpful. Maximum Attack EVs enable Infernape to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment helps it outrun much of the unboosted metagame, including threats such as non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Celebi, whilst Speed tying with Cobalion and opposing Infernape. Choice Band maximizes the power of Infernape's moves, letting it threaten a large part of the tier without any boosts and deal as much damage as possible with Mach Punch and U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>U-turn is the best move to use early on, as it chips down Infernape's checks and provides momentum. Try not to lock Infernape into a move that lets dangerous Pokemon such as Gyarados set up. If you are using Earthquake, utilize it to lure in and remove Pokemon such as Chandelure, Tentacruel, and Arcanine as they try to switch in. Once the Pokemon that resist both of Infernape's STAB moves have been sufficiently worn down, start using Close Combat and Flare Blitz liberally to break down opposing teams. Mach Punch can revenge kill a lot of fast threats and potentially clean up in the end-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Infernape appreciates Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Band Krookodile, as they can trap Chandelure. Electric-types such as Rotom-C and Heliolisk form a good VoltTurn core with Infernape, as they threaten a lot of its checks. Furthermore, other strong U-turn users such as Mega Beedrill work well, as they can pressure and wear down opposing teams quickly. Levitate users and Flying-types, such as Hydreigon and Crobat, mitigate Infernape's weakness to Ground-type attacks. Flying-types are not just great partners for Infernape, but they also threaten it, so Pokemon capable of switching into the likes of Mega Aerodactyl and Tornadus are heavily recommended. Bulky Water-types, such as Empoleon and Swampert, fulfill that role. Swampert and Suicune do not just help with that, but they also take care of opposing Fire-types looking to take advantage of an Infernape locked into Flare Blitz. While Forretress carries some similar checks to Infernape, its ability to lay down Spikes is useful and it can provide opportunities for Infernape to enter the field thanks to its slow Volt Switch. Finally, Fairy-types such as Sylveon appreciate Infernape's ability to break through bulky Steel-types.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Infernape to function as a setup sweeper, dealing serious damage to teams after a boost. Flare Blitz is Infernape's strongest physical Fire-type STAB move. If Flare Blitz's recoil is unappealing, Fire Punch can be used, though even with Iron Fist, it is weak, reaching a mere 90 Base Power, which pales in comparison to Flare Blitz's 120. Close Combat is Infernape's best physical Fighting-type STAB move, allowing it to break through Pokemon such as Empoleon, Krookodile, and Umbreon while attaining good coverage alongside Flare Blitz. Mach Punch can be used to give Infernape some leverage against offensive teams, taking out faster threats such as Mega Absol and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Earthquake hits Mega Ampharos, Nidoqueen, and Tentacruel much harder than any of Infernape's other moves while still giving it a means to beat Chandelure. Thunder Punch is boosted by Iron Fist and allows Infernape to hit Water-types that resist both of its STAB moves, such as Jellicent, Slowking, and Tentacruel. However, a neutral Close Combat will hit all other Water-types just as hard as a super effective Iron Fist-boosted Thunder Punch, so use Thunder Punch only if Mach Punch is used over Close Combat or if these Pokemon are an issue for your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given nature and EVs make Infernape as fast as possible while maximizing Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible. Iron Fist gives a boost to Mach Punch and Thunder Punch and thus should be used only if either of those moves is chosen; otherwise, Blaze is the preferred ability. Life Orb gives Infernape the power it needs to break walls and sweep after a boost, as it is too weak otherwise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Infernape's versatility will keep the opponent guessing which set it is running until Infernape uses a move, so preserve Infernape until a decent opportunity arises, even if it means bluffing a different set. Given how much damage Infernape takes from entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and recoil from Flare Blitz, it won't have many chances to safely set up. Swords Dance is best used when forcing a switch, though it can also be used once Infernape is brought in safely, such as on a resisted hit, after a Pokemon has fainted, or from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Infernape can be used early-game phase as a hole puncher, possibly going for a sweep or softening up the opposing team for its partners during the mid- and late-game phases. If using Mach Punch, Infernape should be handled more carefully, only setting up once defensive Pokemon are weakened and faster Pokemon that can take a +2 Mach Punch have been removed. To some degree, Infernape can also serve as a lure to bulky Water-types, inviting them to switch in and being capable of scoring a 2HKO on Alomomola, Suicune, and defensive Swampert after a single boost with Close Combat. However, prior damage will be required to ensure they are KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chesnaught, Roserade, Forretress, Rhyperior, Swampert, Froslass, and Tentacruel can stack entry hazards to weaken the opposing team, giving Infernape an easier time sweeping. Pokemon that benefit from bulky Water-types being weakened, such as Krookodile, Mienshao, Haxorus, Mega Aerodactyl, and Snorlax, are examples of partners that synergize offensively with this Infernape set due to its ability to lure in and deal with bulky Water-types. Lastly, wallbreakers such as Porygon-Z, Haxorus, Heliolisk, Heracross, Nidoking, Roserade, and Krookodile can soften up defensive Pokemon for Infernape.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz and Close Combat serve as Infernape's strongest physical Fire- and Fighting-type STAB moves, attaining great coverage together. U-turn allows Infernape to get momentum and bring in a teammate, which is especially useful for a Choice Scarf user. Stone Edge is preferred in the last slot, as it is Infernape's only means of covering Chandelure and Noivern with one move, and it also hits Flying-types such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl harder than Flare Blitz does. Earthquake still covers Chandelure while giving Infernape a better alternative against Nidoqueen, Entei, Darmanitan, Tentacruel, and Mega Ampharos.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf allows Infernape to outpace the entire unboosted metagame, as well as all other viable Choice Scarf users. Even Pokemon such as Kabutops and Stoutland under rain or sand, respectively, are outsped by Choice Scarf Infernape. The EVs and nature listed make Infernape as fast as possible while maximizing its Attack, allowing it to get the most out of Choice Scarf. Blaze is the preferred ability, as none of the listed moves are boosted by Iron Fist. Blaze can be helpful for letting Infernape go out with a bang with a boosted Flare Blitz once its HP has dropped low enough.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As with any Pokemon holding a Choice item, prediction is key to success, as using an incorrect move will cost you momentum, giving the opponent a free turn. Use U-turn early-game to get momentum on the opponent, breaking Focus Sashes of lead Pokemon such as Froslass and scoring useful chip damage against offensive Pokemon. Use Infernape's STAB moves at the most appropriate times, as they both have notable drawbacks; Flare Blitz has recoil which wears Infernape down, and Close Combat reduces its defenses, making it much easier to take out afterwards. Because Infernape is both the fastest viable user of Choice Scarf in the tier and often unpredictable, Infernape can surprise a lot of opposing Choice Scarf users, especially if they are used in the lead position. Even though this Infernape set can function as a cleaner late-game, especially against offensive teams, it is significantly weaker than any of its other sets, so team support will be heavily required to weaken bulkier Pokemon for Infernape.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Infernape's great versatility will keep the opponent guessing until its set is revealed, so take advantage of having other Pokemon commonly known to hold Choice Scarf, such as Hydreigon, Mienshao, and Rotom-C, on your team. Pokemon with access to U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Crobat, Mega Beedrill, Hydreigon, Heliolisk, and Forretress, can form VoltTurn cores with this Infernape set, threatening opposing teams offensively while keeping up momentum. Pokemon such as Roserade, Heliolisk, Rotom-C, Shaymin, and Mega Ampharos can threaten bulky Water- and Ground-types that commonly switch into Infernape. Walls such as Arcanine, Gligar, Granbull, Cresselia, and Aromatisse can also stop this set easily, so partners such as Heracross, Suicune, Mega Blastoise, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen are also vastly appreciated for breaking through these Pokemon.</p>"
      },
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Infernape to function as an offensive lead, offering fast entry hazard support for its teammates. Taunt allows Infernape to hassle slower Pokemon that might try to set up their own entry hazards, keeping them off your side of the field. Fire Blast gives Infernape a usable Fire-type STAB move to deal damage with, the primary target of which is Forretress, which would otherwise be able to freely come in and use Rapid Spin. Mach Punch also gives Infernape a usable offensive move with priority, allowing Infernape to safely pick off a faster threat after using Endeavor. This allows Infernape to succeed against faster leads safely. Endeavor lets Infernape bring its target down to however much HP Infernape has; this works well with Focus Sash, as Infernape will be able to always survive with at least 1 HP, leaving the opposing Pokemon to be picked off by Mach Punch or one of Infernape's teammates. Overheat can be used over Fire Blast for its superior accuracy and power, as Infernape will seldom get off more than one attack, and Taunt keeps Infernape from being used as setup bait after the Special Attack drops from Overheat. Flare Blitz allows Infernape to take itself out after its Focus Sash has been used, allowing Infernape to block Rapid Spin and Defog and giving one of Infernape's teammates a free switch. Another attacking move should be used over Taunt in conjunction with Flare Blitz, as it is undesireable to have Infernape's only attack break its Focus Sash prematurely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment gives as much power as possible to Fire Blast while maximizing Infernape's Speed, allowing it to take full advantage of its role as a lead. If using Mach Punch, use a Jolly nature with the Special Attack EVs placed into Attack instead. Focus Sash allows Infernape to survive any attack with at least 1 HP, ensuring it is at least able to set up Stealth Rock. Blaze is the preferred ability if running Fire Blast, and can also be helpful with Focus Sash, allowing Infernape to deliver a boosted Fire Blast at 1 HP. If running Mach Punch as the attacking move, Iron Fist is the preferred ability, as it gives Mach Punch a bit of extra power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should always be used as the team's designated lead, so send it out first. Surprise factor is a big draw to using this set, as Infernape is seldom ever seen as a suicide lead. Set up Stealth Rock immediately, using Endeavor once Infernape's Focus Sash has been activated. Only use Taunt against slower Pokemon that are capable of setting their own entry hazards up. Be wary of Ghost-types, as they will shut this set down due to their immunity to both Endeavor and Mach Punch. Chandelure is a particularly big issue, as it is also immune to Fire Blast, making it a hard counter. This set isn't bothered by Choice Scarf users too badly thanks to Endeavor, allowing Infernape to deal with them early-game. Beware of opposing Focus Sash leads, as nearly all of them hinder Infernape in some way: Galvantula can set up Sticky Web, and Taunt isn't a reliable way of stopping it because Infernape can only Speed tie with it; Espeon and Aerodactyl both outspeed Infernape and can thus set up with their respective moves before Infernape can do anything, and the latter two Pokemon can use Taunt to hinder Infernape.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is to be used only for heavily offensive teams, so pair it with offensive Pokemon. Attackers such as Hydreigon, Mienshao, Roserade, Celebi, Heliolisk, and Nidoking all benefit from Infernape's Stealth Rock support, while many are able to put offensive pressure on Rapid Spin and Defog users. Mega Aerodactyl, Honchkrow, and Krookodile are capable of trapping Ghost-types with Pursuit, making it easier for Infernape to do its job. Setup sweepers such as Lucario, Suicune, and Mega Absol can sweep much more easily while Stealth Rock is on the opposing side.</p>"

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>With a high Special Attack stat and two good abilities in Natural Cure and Technician, Roserade can have a strong offensive presence. Moreover, it has quite high Special Defense, which allows it to take on a more passive role. Having access to Sleep Powder, Toxic Spikes, and Spikes, it can also function as a great entry hazard setter. However, its poor Defense and mediocre Speed mean that Roserade can easily overpowered by a lot of top threats such as Choice Band Entei, Choice Band Krookodile, Infernape, and so on.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An option for the specially defensive set is Aromatherapy, which allows Roserade to heal teammates from status. Another option is Leech Seed, which allows Roserade to sap its foe's health and recover slowly. On the offensive set, Dazzling Gleam may be used to hit Pokemon such as Hydreigon very hard. Hidden Power Ground is an alternate option to hit Steel-types, while Hidden Power Rock can be used to lure in and KO Chandelure, which resists both of Roserade's STAB moves. Weather Ball is an option if Roserade is used on a Rain Dance team.</p> <p>Roserade can utilize Sleep Powder and Spikes with Focus Sash to function as a suicide lead. Roserade can also utilize a Choice Scarf set to turn into a decent revenge killer. Such a set can be used effectively in the lead position, as incapacitating Pokemon at the start of the game with Sleep Powder can be very useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Crobat can take every attack Roserade has apart from Extrasensory, which is quite rare, and Choice Band variants can run Sleep Talk to combat Sleep Powder. Aerodactyl resists Roserade's Poison STAB moves and can easily OHKO it with Aerial Ace.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Roserade's Defense is weak, so any moderately strong attacker with a powerful move should be able to OHKO it. Roserade only has a slightly above average Speed tier, so it isn't that hard to outspeed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Darmanitan, Chandelure, and Entei can either outspeed Roserade or take its attacks and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Dedicated special walls such as Blissey, Umbreon, and Snorlax can take all of Roserade's attacks and whittle it down.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If Roserade does not have Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types such as Forretress and Mega Aggron can take all of Roserade's attacks relatively well.</p>",

      "Offensive Hazards": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes and Toxic Spikes allow Roserade to set up entry hazards for its team. Sludge Bomb is a powerful move with a high chance of poisoning the foe and is the move Roserade uses as its main form of offense. Leaf Storm does an incredible amount of damage to Pokemon that aren't specially defensive or resistant to it. Giga Drain, however, can restore health and doesn't result in a Special Attack drop at the cost of power. Sleep Powder allows Roserade to cripple opposing Pokemon and can be used to allow Roserade to set up more entry hazards. Hidden Power Fire can hit Steel-types such as Forretress which otherwise wall Roserade while Extrasensory can hit Pokemon such as Crobat, Chesnaught, and Toxicroak, all of which can take Roserade's other attacks. Hidden Power Ground is also an option to hit opposing Tentacruel, Nidoqueen, Entei, and Chandelure hard while maintaining coverage against Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Technician allows Roserade to boost its Hidden Power's damage output. If you forgo Hidden Power, Natural Cure can be a nice option to allow Roserade to avoid incoming Scald burns or paralysis. Life Orb is used to boost the power of Roserade's moves, and 29 HP IVs allow Roserade to take minimal recoil damage from it. Alternatively, Black Sludge allows Roserade to come onto the field more reliably and set up Spikes more easily. A Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs is used to make Roserade as fast as possible, while 252 Special Attack EVs are used to boost its damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You should switch Roserade in on slower Pokemon and try to use Sleep Powder. In addition, you can use Sleep Powder on predicted switches to cripple the foe. This will allow Roserade to get at least one layer of entry hazards down. Sludge Bomb should be Roserade's main form of offense, as it is strong, can poison, and has no negative effects. If Roserade has Leaf Storm, it should only be used once as a powerful attack; switching out soon after is recommended. If Roserade has Giga Drain, use it when it is super effective on a foe or when they resist Sludge Bomb. Try to bring Roserade in via Volt Switch or U-turn, as it does not appreciate getting hurt, largely due to its poor physical bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate prior damage to their foes work well with Roserade, as if it sets up three layers of Spikes, grounded foes will lose 25% of their health upon switching in. An example of a Pokemon that appreciates entry hazard support is Entei, which deals massive damage on the switch already. Chandelure can work as a spinblocker, preventing Roserade's entry hazards from being removed. Stealth Rock users help damage the opposing team severely when they switch. Swampert is a good Stealth Rock user to pair with Roserade, as Roserade resists its Grass weakness while Swampert can take physical hits well. Mega Ampharos can handle Fire- and Flying-types. In addition, Swampert, Vaporeon, Alomomola and other bulky Water-types can deal with Fire-types that Roserade struggles against. Hydreigon appreciates entry hazard support and the removal of Fairies. The same goes for Mega Ampharos, and both can get Roserade in safely via U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure and Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune greatly appreciate Toxic Spikes support, as it aids them in setting up by wearing foes down. Fire-types such as Darmanitan and Infernape can help deal with Steel-types that wall variants of Roserade that lack Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Synthesis is used for instant health recovery, but it is unreliable because of its low PP, which can be annoying against defensive teams. Spikes allows Roserade to wear the opposing team down when they switch in, while Toxic Spikes works well against defensive teams and stall teams, as it cripples them with poison. Giga Drain allows Roserade to restore a little bit of health while attacking, but it is quite weak. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used as a moderately powerful move with a high chance of poisoning its target. Sleep Powder allows Roserade to cripple Pokemon, but it does not work well with Toxic Spikes. Rest can be used over Synthesis to heal Roserade to full health, and Roserade can cure its sleep by switching out but Roserade becomes setup bait when using it, as it is forced to give the opponent a free turn. However, Rest allows Roserade to PP stall some walls, such as Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Natural Cure lets Roserade sponge status and remove it when switching. Black Sludge is used for recovery and damages Trick and Switcheroo users if they trade items with Roserade. 240 HP EVs are used to gain maximum Black Sludge recovery and take less damage from entry hazards. 252 Special Defense EVs are used to make Roserade as specially bulky as possible. 16 Speed EVs allow Roserade to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 60 Speed Pokemon. A Calm nature is used to boost Roserade's Special Defense. You may use both entry hazards if the team definitely needs it, but that is not generally advised, as missing out on another move hinders Roserade.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Roserade in on weak special attackers. It can easily come in on bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic (even Ice Beam variants do not trouble it that much). Setting up entry hazards is a good idea at this point, as bulky Water-types cannot harm Roserade, so they have to switch or still do nothing to it. If you are running Synthesis, you should use it sparingly, as it has limited PP. Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb should be used as Roserade's attacking move and Sleep Powder should be used to cripple foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Roserade is extremely physically frail, it appreciates Pokemon that can take these hits. Forretress can do this and aid Roserade in wearing down the team with its own entry hazards, but you must beware of the Fire weakness they share. Rotom-H can burn physical attackers, take physical hits for Roserade, and has good type synergy with it, resisting its Fire- and Flying-type weaknesses. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can deal with Fire-types that trouble Roserade. Mega Ampharos can deal with its Flying weakness, but both it and Roserade need support to deal with Ice-types. Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure and Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune greatly appreciate Toxic Spikes support from Roserade, as it helps them set up by weakening foes.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has access to many unique tools that combine to make it a viable defensive threat in the UnderUsed metagame. Its Water / Ground typing combined with an excellent ability in Storm Drain gives it a number of useful resistances and immunities, particularly making it an optimal Scald switch-in as well as a threat to VoltTurn cores. Because of its access to Recover, Gastrodon further distinguishes itself from other Curse users like Swampert and Snorlax, as the instantaneous recovery allows Gastrodon to heal damage without putting itself to sleep. This lets it function as a more utility-oriented Curse user whose purpose in setting up with Curse is less to sweep than to improve its ability to check physical attackers. However, while Gastrodon has impressive special bulk, it is extremely weak to status, and its mediocre physical bulk prevents it from countering numerous offensive threats without a couple of boosts. Unlike Swampert, it does not possess Stealth Rock or Roar and has little utility outside of its helpful immunities. In addition, Gastrodon is hard countered by and gives free turns to Celebi, one of the tier's most dangerous sweepers. These cons, along with the sheer number of effective defensive Water-types in the tier, make Gastrodon a very niche Pokemon in UnderUsed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive set with Clear Smog or Toxic is not unviable but is largely outclassed by more reliable defensive threats such as Milotic. This set should only be considered if Gastrodon's immunities are essential to a team's success. A maximum Special Attack Life Orb set with Scald, Earth Power, Ice Beam or Sludge Bomb, and Recover can be very threatening after a Storm Drain boost. Yawn can force Grass-types switching into Gastrodon back out before they can attack it, limiting a team's options of countering it. Mirror Coat can help Gastrodon deal with powerful special attackers that take little damage from both of its STAB attacks. Memento is an interesting option to potentially clear the way for a surprise sweep from the likes of Slurpuff and Cloyster, but it is unreliable and forces Gastrodon to forfeit a more consistently useful move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Every Grass-type in the tier except Whimsicott OHKOes Gastrodon with their 4x super effective STAB attacks, and only Roserade fears switching directly into either of Gastrodon's attacking moves. Celebi hard counters it in any possible way and makes it quite useless.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis is simply annoying rather than devastating, but no amount of recovery can prevent Gastrodon from being worn down if it is afflicted with Toxic poison, and burn is nearly as debilitating.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers that don't mind switching into Scald, such as Kyurem, can deal massive damage to Gastrodon, effectively revenge killing it or preventing it from setting up. Taunt Hydreigon in particular is a massive threat, as it can prevent Gastrodon from recovering and render it useless thanks to its typing and Levitate.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types and Levitate Users</strong>: Most Flying-types and Levitate users aren't terribly hindered by a Scald burn, so they often shut down the Curse set and must be removed before Gastrodon can attempt a sweep. That said, not all Flying-types are capable of simply stalling Gastrodon out, especially if they contract a Scald burn. Crobat and other Flying-types can be forced to Roost, giving Gastrodon the opportunity to do massive damage with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Coverage and Lures</strong>: Grass Knot from Empoleon is an example of a coverage move that seriously threatens Gastrodon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse increases Gastrodon's offensive and defensive capabilities while only decreasing its already awful Speed. Recover boosts Gastrodon's longevity, allowing it to switch into powerful threats throughout a match and still survive for a potential late-game sweep. Earthquake is its most powerful STAB attack and deals massive damage once boosted; however, Gastrodon only has a mediocre base 83 Attack stat, so its damage output before boosting will be far from threatening. Scald prevents Gastrodon from being utterly useless before setting up and lends it some potential anti-offense utility by spreading burns. Ice Beam can be used in the last slot to hit Ground-immune Dragon-types or Celebi, although Scald is largely the more reliable and useful move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and a Sassy nature provide Gastrodon with enough bulk to sponge hits from the tier's most threatening special attackers while maintaining sufficient physical bulk to avoid 2HKOs from the likes of Cobalion. The primary benchmark this spread meets is avoiding a 2HKO from Nidoqueen's Earth Power after Stealth Rock damage. 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD is another viable spread that makes Gastrodon an even better answer to Nidoqueen, Mega Blastoise, and other powerful special attackers, although it leaves Gastrodon susceptible to 2HKOs from even relatively weak physical attackers such as Crobat and the aforementioned Cobalion. Leftovers gives Gastrodon passive recovery, which lets it heal even more HP in conjunction with Recover. Storm Drain is a large part of Gastrodon's niche, as it grants an extremely useful immunity to Water-type moves while boosting its Special Attack when hit by one.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gastrodon sets up Curse on quite a few of the tier's special attackers and Water-types, especially Suicune and Gyarados, the latter of which it can stall out of Bounce PP barring any critical hits. However, Gastrodon is extremely weak before setting up and therefore cannot reliably be expected to check even physically frail threats that it hits super effectively with Earthquake, such as Lucario, which it has a low chance to OHKO. While its special bulk is nothing to scoff at, Gastrodon's pales in comparison to Snorlax's, so it is more vulnerable to being worn down by extremely powerful special attackers, especially if it's been Taunted. While Gastrodon's typing and ability allow it to switch into many attackers freely, be sure to keep it healthy, or it will struggle to check strong threats. Be especially wary of Toxic and Will-O-Wisp users, as they seriously cripple Gastrodon and make it much less threatening defensively. Should you intend to sweep with Gastrodon, it must be put off until it is late in the game and all the opposing team's Grass-types and especially powerful special attackers have been removed, as the former will always force it out and the latter are extremely effective revenge killers regardless of how many Curse boosts Gastrodon has managed to get off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gastrodon's greatest weakness is to Grass-types, so Pokemon that can repeatedly counter them, such as Mandibuzz, Arcanine and Escavalier, make for marvelous teammates. Entei is another option capable of pressuring Grass-types offensively and punishing switch-ins. Cleric support is vital, as Gastrodon is crippled by burns from Sacred Fire and Will-O-Wisp and devastated by Toxic; this makes Florges, which is also capable of switching into one of Gastrodon's greatest threats in Taunt Hydreigon as well as many of the tier's Grass-types, perhaps the single best partner for it. Toxic Spikes can wear down Gastrodon's checks without Gastrodon having to directly damage them, leaving it more free to set up and recover HP as needed; Roserade in particular has the best defensive synergy with Gastrodon. It is extremely important to pair Gastrodon with some form of entry hazard removal, since Toxic Spikes can and will wear it down, preventing it from checking the threats it should. Forretress is capable of countering most of the tier's Grass-types and removing only the opponent's hazards with Rapid Spin, but Crobat in particular has phenomenal defensive synergy with Gastrodon as well as access to Defog and Roost, which increases its longevity so that it can switch into Grass-types throughout a match.</p>"

  "Honchkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>With a massive base 125 Attack, a great offensive typing, a good ability, and powerful priority in Sucker Punch, Honchkrow is one of the strongest offensive Pokemon in the tier. It serves as a nice wallbreaker and late-game cleaner for offensive teams, as it can sweep weakened teams with a combination of Moxie and Sucker Punch, takes advantage of its huge Attack stat with its access to Brave Bird, and can even force mind games with Pursuit. However, Honchkrow has many flaws that hold it back. It has a mediocre defensive typing that leaves it weak to Stealth Rock, letting it get worn down by Life Orb recoil and recoil from Brave Bird more easily, even with access to Roost. It also has a somewhat shallow movepool. It also has poor defenses, making it extremely frail, and its Speed isn't so great either, making it reliant on Sucker Punch when up against faster offensive threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can block status and prevent Honchkrow from getting revenge killed by Pokemon such as Hydreigon. Heat Wave can remove Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Forretress, but it doesn't have great coverage otherwise. Choice Scarf can boost Honchkrow's Speed, but Honchkrow has access to Sucker Punch anyway and doesn't have a great Speed tier. Taunt stops bulky Pokemon from setting up on Honchkrow, but it has little use over Honchkrow's coverage options. Tailwind can support Honchkrow and its teammates by patching up Honchkrow's middling Speed. Thunder Wave can cripple common checks to Honchkrow, such as Hydreigon. Choice Band can boost Honchkrow's Attack by a large margin, but Honchkrow appreciates having the ability to switch moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon That Resist Dark</strong>: Pokemon that resist Dark-type moves and can OHKO Honchkrow such as Hydreigon, Heracross, Cobalion, and Whimsicott are good answers to Honchkrow, as they can usually revenge kill Honchkrow after taking a boosted Sucker Punch. However, none of them can switch into Honchkrow's Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon That Resist Flying</strong>: Pokemon with high Defense, such as Mega Aggron, Mega Ampharos, and Diancie can all tank Honchkrow's Brave Bird with little trouble and can force it out. However, they all get worn down through repeated switching in. Mega Aerodactyl can also deal with Honchkrow reliably thanks to Roost, although it must be wary of Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Intimidate users, such as Arcanine and defensive variants of Gyarados, can take Honchkrow's attacks reliably and heal off any damage taken. Arcanine can burn Honchkrow with Will-O-Wisp and can wear it down quickly with Rocky Helmet if it gets hit.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Suicune and Alomomola, can deal with Honchkrow thanks to their great overall bulk and can cripple Honchkrow with Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Mega Aggron</strong>: Mega Aggron can switch into most of Honchkrow's attacks with little trouble, thanks to its huge physical bulk. However, it doesn't like taking a boosted Superpower.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird can 2HKO nearly anything that doesn't resist it. Sucker Punch slightly makes up for Honchkrow's middling Speed. Pursuit traps Psychic-type Pokemon such as Slowking and causes mind games with Sucker Punch, which can put a lot of pressure on the opponent, especially if Honchkrow has a Moxie boost. Roost mitigates the recoil caused by Brave Bird and Life Orb. Superpower hits Steel- and Dark-types such as Lucario, Aggron, Krookodile, Umbreon, and Hydreigon for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Attack and Speed are maximized so that Honchkrow is as fast and powerful as possible, with the Speed investment allowing it to outspeed uninvested Pokemon with a base Speed of 100. An Adamant nature is used to increase Honchkrow's damage output; however, Jolly can be used to outspeed maximum Speed base 70s if needed. Life Orb helps Honchkrow clean, and its recoil isn't too problematic thanks to Roost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Honchkrow is usually used as a late-game cleaner and shouldn't be on the field much early-game; although it can punch holes in opposing teams, it's better off, in most cases, picking off weakened threats. Honchkrow should usually be trying to clean after faster Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch such as Hydreigon and Krookodile have been removed, as they are reliable bulky offense Pokemon that can take Honchkrow out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Metagross, Roserade, and Mega Swampert makes it easier for Honchkrow to sweep with Moxie late-game, as this helps wear down some of its common threats. Pokemon that can check Dark-types such as Krookodile and Hydreigon make it easier for Honchkrow to clean, as they can tank Sucker Punches with little trouble; Whimsicott is an especially good partner, as it resists both of Krookodile's and Hydreigon's STAB attacks and can bring in Honchkrow safely with U-turn or support it with Tailwind, Memento, or Stun Spore. In the same token, pivots such as Forretress, Cobalion, and Mega Ampharos are good partners, as they can bring Honchkrow in safely, giving it opportunities to Pursuit trap or wallbreak with Brave Bird. Late-game cleaners that can take advantage of Honchkrow's wallbreaking prowess are also good teammates; Lucario and Cobalion in particular enjoy Honchkrow forcing out and trapping Chandelure and Psychic-types such as Celebi.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Bronzong is an excellent support Pokemon, having access to Stealth Rock, dual screens, and Trick Room, which makes it a valuable addition to many teams. It has great overall bulk which is backed up by a decent defensive typing and a great ability, making it an excellent counter to many of the tier's top threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Kyurem, Shaymin, Nidoqueen, and Mega Abomasnow. Its main selling point over its Steel-type brethren, such as Mega Aggron and Forretress, is Levitate, which makes it immune to entry hazards bar Stealth Rock and rules out using Ground-type coverage commonly seen on sweepers such as the aforementioned Mega Aerodactyl, Kyurem, Mega Abomasnow, and Nidoqueen as a means of getting past it. It also does not take up a Mega slot, which is another advantage it holds over Mega Aggron.</p> <p>However, the big metallic bell is not without its faults; its mediocre offensive stats and terrible Speed mean that it is setup bait for several Pokemon, and its lack of reliable recovery makes it prone to being worn down and it will not like to switch in repeatedly to take even resisted hits. Its typing makes it weak to Dark-type moves, and with the prevalence of Knock Off and trapping ability of Pursuit, this is quite crippling.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bronzong can run an effective dual screens set with its bulk and defensive typing. Its access to Explosion also lets it set up screens and then explode to let a teammate come in safely. Hypnosis can be used to temporarily incapacitate threatening switch-ins or to let a teammate set up. Bronzong can also utilize Trick with Choice Band or Iron Ball as its held item in order to cripple some of its common switch-ins including Suicune, Rotom-H, and Gligar. Grass Knot 2HKOes Swampert while Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal significant damage to Gligar. However, without any Special Attack investment these moves are not going to be doing much damage unless they are 4x super effective, and are hence quite situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark- and Ghost-types</strong>: Dark- and Ghost-type Pokemon can easily KO Bronzong with their STAB attacks. Krookodile is especially threatening, as it can permanently remove Bronzong from the game with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Sweepers</strong>: Certain bulky sweepers such as Suicune, Feraligatr, Snorlax, and Cresselia can use Bronzong as setup bait, but they dislike Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Reuniclus</strong>: Bronzong is utterly helpless against Reuniclus. Toxic has no effect on it thanks to Magic Guard, while Gyro Ball does pitiful damage due to Reuniclus's terrible Speed stat.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Powerful Fire-types such as Entei, Chandelure, and Darmanitan can KO Bronzong with their STAB attacks, although they need to watch out for Earthquake.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bronzong is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users in the tier, being able to use its excellent defenses and multiple resistances to come in and set it up with ease. Gyro Ball is powered up greatly by Bronzong's terrible Speed, taking a good chunk out of most Pokemon that don't resist it. Iron Head can be used as an alternative option to conserve PP, especially against SubRoost Kyurem, and hit slow Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Mega Abomasnow harder; however, it is far weaker than Gyro Ball against faster Pokemon. Toxic helps to cripple many sweepers and walls and goes well with Bronzong's defensive nature, while Earthquake hits Steel- and Fire-types that resist its STAB moves, such as Empoleon and Entei. Protect can be used instead of Earthquake to garner a much-appreciated free turn of Leftovers recovery and let poison damage build. However, this leaves Bronzong completely helpless against Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense make Bronzong an immensely sturdy special sponge, equipping it to take on some of the most threatening special attackers in the tier such as Kyurem, Nidoqueen, and Shaymin. A Sassy nature combined with 0 Speed IVs powers up Gyro Ball as much as possible. A Careful nature should be run if Iron Head is used. Leftovers is a must for longevity, as Bronzong lacks a reliable recovery move. Bronzong can use a physically defensive set instead with a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD and a Relaxed nature to better counter physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl. Whichever one you use depends on your team's requirements, though Bronzong can usually take on the aforementioned Pokemon well enough even without investment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzong is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users in the tier, so take advantage of its excellent defenses and multiple resistances to switch it in and set it up with ease. Thanks to Levitate and its Stealth Rock resistance, it can switch in multiple times throughout the match, making it an excellent defensive pivot for balanced teams. With its great bulk, it makes for an excellent counter to many of the tier's top threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Kyurem, Shaymin, Nidoqueen, and Mega Abomasnow. Be careful of switching it in recklessly though, as with no reliable recovery Bronzong is not going to like repeatedly taking even resisted hits too often.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Common sweepers that benefit from Stealth Rock support, such as Mega Aerodactyl, are great partners. Bronzong has no reliable recovery, so Wish users make for excellent teammates. Physically defensive Aromatisse and Vaporeon in particular have excellent defensive synergy with Bronzong and can pass it massive Wishes thanks to their huge HP stats. Knock Off absorbers such as Mega Blastoise and Chesnaught are also appreciated by Bronzong, which is severely crippled by the move. A particularly good teammate for Bronzong is Tentacruel; it and Bronzong complement each other perfectly, resisting each other's weaknesses and being able to set up Stealth Rock, spin, and set up Toxic Spikes between them.</p>"

      "Trick Room Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyro Ball is ridiculously powerful when backed up by the Attack investment, Brave nature, and Macho Brace. With Macho Brace and 0 Speed IVs, Bronzong hits 31 Speed, which means that anything with a Speed stat of 185 or over is smashed with a 150 Base Power STAB move. Trick Room allows Bronzong to outspeed the vast majority of the metagame and wreak havoc on offensive teams in particular, making it an excellent late-game cleaner. Earthquake does huge damage to the Fire-types and Steel-types that resist Gyro Ball, while Stealth Rock can be used to provide team support if required. Explosion is used to go out with a bang once Bronzong's job is done, hopefully taking something down with it in the process.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP provides Bronzong with decent overall bulk, while maximum Attack is needed to hit as hard as possible. The Brave nature, 0 Speed IVs, and Macho Brace power up Gyro Ball to ridiculous levels. Mental Herb can be used to prevent Taunt users from ruining Bronzong's day, while Leftovers is an option for increased longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Trick Room Bronzong can be played as a suicide lead of sorts to set up Stealth Rock and Trick Room quickly and then explode in order to bring your slow sweepers in safely. It finds plenty of opportunities to come in and provide support with its excellent bulk and resistances. Bronzong can also be used as a sweeping tool late-game against weakened teams with Gyro Ball's immense power. Even though this set is offensively oriented, Bronzong still has excellent bulk with the HP investment and can therefore be used to check threats that could potentially be dangerous to your team without Bronzong, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Nidoqueen, and Kyurem.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Bronzong doesn't need much support itself; instead, it can provide excellent support for dedicated Trick Room teams. Hence, slow sweepers that benefit from Trick Room support, such as Mega Abomasnow, Mega Camerupt, Escavalier, and Mega Ampharos, make for great teammates. Bronzong has no reliable recovery, so Wish users such as Aromatisse and Vaporeon can be used to continuously replenish Bronzong's health so that it can switch in to set up Trick Room multiple times in the match. Bronzong appreciates Knock Off absorbers such as Mega Blastoise and Chesnaught, as it is severely crippled by the move.</p>"

Furthermore, its typing is best suited to take on the bulky set up sweepers of the tier such as Snorlax and Reuniclus which leaves it completely outclassed by Sableye who is able to more effectively handle those threats.  However, there are certain boons to using Spiritomb over some of its competition, notably its higher Attack stat and access to a strong Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Sneak could be used over Sucker Punch for a more reliable priority move, but it's significantly weaker. Psychic can be used to hit Conkeldurr and Heracross, considering that they love switching in to get burned, but Spiritomb's other moves are too valuable to be replaced. A Custap Berry + Destiny Bond set can be used to surprise the foe and take them down with Spiritomb. An offensive set could be used with Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball to hit specially frail Pokemon while Pursuit trapping physically frail foes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Fire-types</strong>: Entei, Choice Specs Rotom-H, Darmanitan, and Mega Camerupt are immune to Will-O-Wisp, have enough bulk to take a hit from Spiritomb and can deal huge damage back to it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Florges, Sylveon, Gardevoir and others can hit Spiritomb super effectively with their STAB moves while resisting Spiritomb's Dark-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Taunt Users</strong>: Mandibuzz, Krookodile, and Hydreigon resist both of Spiritomb's STAB types and can Taunt it, stopping it from using Will-O-Wisp, healing, or setting up.</p> <p><strong>Guts Users</strong>: Conkeldurr and Heracross enjoy being burned and can do massive damage to Spiritomb in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: The offensive set is a setup bait for the likes of Calm Mind Suicune and Calm Mind Florges, which take little damage from Spiritomb's attacks, and Will-O-Wisp is useless on them.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Hydreigon, Kyurem, Mega Ampharos, and Dragalge can do massive damage to Spiritomb due to its mediocre special bulk.</p>",

Foul Play lets Spiritomb discourage opposing sweepers from setting up in front of it. Taunt can be used as well to entirely stop setup or recovery as well, notably from Reuniclus, Slowking, and Snorlax. However, Pursuit enables Spiritomb to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Espeon, Chandelure, Slowking, and Reuniclus. Alternatively, Pain Split helps Spiritomb recover its low HP while damaging the foe.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set focuses on Spiritomb's offensive prowess as well as providing support for the team, while bypassing screens and Substitutes thanks to Infiltrator. 252 HP EVs and 252 Attack EVs with Adamant nature are used, to improve Spiritomb's ability to withstand hits and attack the foe. Black Glasses can increase the power of Foul Play, Pursuit, and Sucker Punch, while Leftovers give Spiritomb a bit of recovery, which is important if not running Pain Split.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best on balanced teams where can check a lot of setup sweepers, such as Doublade, Reuniclus, and Curse Snorlax as well as fast revenge killers, such as Mienshao and Espeon and then trap them with Pursuit. giving balanced teams a great Pokemon to check these threats. Spiritomb can also be useful to handle Choice locked pokemon as you can sometimes freely trap them with Pursuit, freeing up the rest of your team.

The former two can provide entry hazards while the latter two can set up on Fairies. Spiritomb loves bulky Water-type partners, such as Suicune, Alomomola, Swampert, Empoleon, and Vaporeon, as they can beat strong Fire-types, which put pressure on Spiritomb. Grounded Poison-types, such as Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Toxicroak, can absorb Toxic Spikes as well as check Fairy-types.

Sleep Talk allows you to function more similarly to other bulky set up sweepers, but Will-O-Wisp is usually preferred.

It also has a great ability in Justified, which lets it take advantage of Dark-type moves, such as Mega Absol's Knock Off. However, Lucario has poor defenses, which make it hard for it to take nearly any hit; in some cases, it can even get 2HKOed by a resisted hit, despite its good set of resistances. Lucario has weaknesses to many common attacking types, particularly Fire, Fighting, and Ground, and its Speed stat, while by no means bad, is somewhat underwhelming, although this is slightly mitigated by Lucario's access to priority. Lucario also needs to set up in order to deal a lot of damage.</p>",

Close Combat serves as a Fighting-type STAB attack that has good coverage and is very powerful when boosted, hitting Pokemon such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Empoleon, and is very powerful when boosted. Extreme Speed lets Lucario outprioritize all opposing priority, even from Pokemon that are faster than it, and it also gives Lucario a good option to hit common Choice Scarf users or Pokemon that are naturally faster than it. Bullet Punch is a weaker alternative, despite its STAB boost, but is significant in that it serves as a priority move that can beat the likes of Mega Aerodactyl, which is a common check to Lucario, as it resists Extreme Speed. Ice Punch hits the likes of Gligar, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, while Earthquake hits the latter two Pokemon and Fire-types, particularly Chandelure, and Crunch hits Ghost-types. When using either Earthquake or Crunch, make sure to run a Jolly nature in order to outspeed Timid Chandelure. Iron Tail can also be used in the last moveslot to hit Fairy-types, such as Aromatisse and Florges, considering Bullet Punch may not do enough to KO them, even when boosted.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is used to maximize Lucario's Attack; a Jolly nature is not the primary option, considering Lucario has access to Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch, but it can be used to outspeed certain Pokemon, such as Timid Chandelure, Modest Kyurem, and Adamant Krookodile. The given EV spread is used to give Lucario as much Attack and Speed as possible. Life Orb is used to increase Lucario's Attack stat to massive levels, making it easier for Lucario to sweep, especially against offensive teams.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lucario has somewhat of a hard time setting up due to its poor defenses, so it should usually come in on predicted switches or on weak attacks that it can tank and take advantage of, such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. Lucario should be trying to sweep late-game, when most of its common checks and counters are either removed or weakened to a point where Lucario can KO them at +2.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can bring Lucario in safely through Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Mega Ampharos, Crobat, and Forretress, make for good partners, as they can get Lucario on the field for a potential sweep without risking it taking any damage. Lucario loves entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Swampert, Froslass, Nidoqueen, and Roserade, as they whittle down the opposing Pokemon and make it easier for Lucario to sweep. Pokemon that can check Mega Aerodactyl, which beats all variants of Lucario not carrying Bullet Punch, are also good partners, as Mega Aerodactyl is one of the few Pokemon that can check it reliably. Swampert gets a special mention, as it checks Mega Aerodactyl easily while setting up Stealth Rock for Lucario.

Focus Blast is Lucario's most powerful STAB move and has the capability to OHKO Mega Swampert, Snorlax, and Suicune at +2. Aura Sphere can be used alternatively for its perfect accuracy, but at the cost of some power. Flash Cannon is Lucario's Steel-type STAB move and is generally used to pound the Fairy-types that resist Lucario's other moves, such as Florges and Aromatisse. Vacuum Wave is used as Lucario's priority attack, gaining STAB and dealing a good amount of damage when boosted by Nasty Plot. Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Cresselia and Chandelure, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is used to let Lucario outspeed as many Pokemon as it can, while a Modest nature gives it more power; it should be noted that Vacuum Wave should be used if running a Modest nature, while Dark Pulse should be used if running a Timid nature. The given EV spread is used to maximize Lucario's Special Attack and Speed. Life Orb is used to give Lucario a significant power boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lucario has a hard time getting on the field due to its poor defenses, so it should be brought in with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, or after a teammate goes down. It can force out a large portion of the tier, so it should be setting up while forcing a Pokemon out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, such as Nidoqueen, Froslass, and Swampert, are great partners for Lucario. Stealth Rock support in particular is appreciated, as it wears down Fire- and Flying-types, both of which Lucario hates. Pokemon that can bring Lucario in safely via Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Mega Ampharos and Gligar, are also appreciated. Mega Ampharos gets a special mention, as it is a great check to Crobat, which is annoying for this set. Wallbreakers, such as Life Orb Hydreigon, are also good partners for Lucario, as they break down certain special walls. Pursuit support to weaken Ghost-types and Psychic-types is also appreciated if Lucario lacks Dark Pulse. Mega Aerodactyl and Krookodile are great options for this role.</p>"

  "Toxicroak": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxicroak's bulk is not particularly good, and it lacks the raw power to be a threat without setting up; however, it is an important Pokemon in the UnderUsed tier thanks to the combination of its unique typing, Dry Skin, and its ability to threaten common defensive cores. Toxicroak's resistance to common attacking types such as Dark, Fighting, and Rock and its immunity to Water-type moves improve its ability to switch in and set up massively. Additionally, Toxicroak's movepool allows it to work as either a physical or a special sweeper, which makes it fairly versatile and unpredictable.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Salac Berry Toxicroak, with Nasty Plot and either Substitute or Endure, is one of the few Pokemon that can successfully use Belch; however, setting up a sweep with this set requires a significant amount of support, and even at +1 Speed, Toxicroak isn't hard to revenge kill. Bulky Croak can use Bulk Up over Swords Dance, but the latter is significantly more reliable in most common scenarios. Toxicroak can use Taunt to stop Pokemon such as Cresselia and Doublade from healing or setting up, but it heavily relies on prediction because these Pokemon can threaten Toxicroak with their STAB moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Cresselia</strong>: Toxicroak cannot OHKO Cresselia with any move, not even at +2 with a Life Orb boost, and Psychic will always OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Crobat</strong>: Crobat resists Toxicroak's STAB types, and if healthy it survives both Ice Punch and Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock damage, which means Crobat can easily Roost off damage from unboosted Toxicroak's attacks and OHKO it with Brave Bird or Acrobatics. Note that +2 Sucker Punch doesn't KO Crobat after Stealth Rock but does enough for Brave Bird recoil to finish it off, which allows Toxicroak to trade KOs to support its team.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Physical Toxicroak sets cannot OHKO defensive Swampert with anything, and Swampert easily KOes it with Earthquake. Gligar walls any set without Ice-type coverage; however, Knock Off cripples it. Nidoqueen is bulky enough to deal with any set without Ice-type coverage or Earthquake, and it OHKOes Toxicroak with Earth Power. Krookodile can switch into any non-Fighting-type STAB move, has Intimidate, and resists Sucker Punch, but Vacuum Wave from the Nasty Plot set can KO at +2 or if Krookodile has taken previous damage. Mamoswine and Nidoking easily check Bulky Croak, as they are faster and easily survive +2 Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Doublade</strong>: Sets without Knock Off, Dark Pulse, or Earthquake simply cannot touch Doublade. Sucker Punch does not help against Doublade, as it can simply set up Swords Dance, forcing Toxicroak to win an absurd number of 50-50s against a +6 Doublade in order to do anything.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Thanks to Intimidate, Swords Dance Toxicroak cannot OHKO defensive Arcanine with Gunk Shot after Stealth Rock damage. Nasty Plot Toxicroak has an easier time dealing with Arcanine, but without a boost, it won't be able to OHKO. Offensive Arcanine revenge kills any set.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon</strong>: Any Pokemon faster than Toxicroak that isn't OHKOed by +2 Sucker Punch or Vacuum Wave, such as Entei or Shaymin, can check Toxicroak. However, note that if they are not able to OHKO Toxicroak, Drain Punch can help it regain some of the HP lost.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Toxicroak's Attack to allow it to break through defensive Pokemon. Gunk Shot is Toxicroak's main STAB move because it hits extremely hard, especially at +2, and the 30% poison chance can be used to try to wear down some of Toxicroak's checks before attempting to sweep. Drain Punch provides good coverage with Gunk Shot and helps Toxicroak stay alive for longer in certain scenarios. Alternatively, Low Kick can be used to hit Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Swampert significantly harder. Sucker Punch makes Toxicroak harder to revenge kill and provides useful coverage combined with its STAB moves. Ice Punch allows Toxicroak to hit Pokemon such as Gligar and Nidoqueen for super effective damage. Knock Off helps against Cresselia, Reuniclus, Jellicent, and Doublade, and it can also be used to cripple a huge portion of the metagame. Earthquake can be used, as it covers both Doublade and Nidoqueen and OHKOes defensive Arcanine at +2.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Toxicroak's Attack and Speed. A Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed Chandelure and Mamoswine and Speed tie with Nidoking, Heracross, and offensive Suicune. However, an Adamant nature can be used to hit significantly harder, but it also makes Toxicroak significantly easier to revenge kill. Toxicroak needs Life Orb's power boost to help it break through some walls, but Black Sludge can be used for slightly more longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used mainly as a wallbreaker. Analyzing the opponent's team during Team Preview is important, as this allows you to find setup opportunities for Toxicroak and helps you decide how to proceed. Toxicroak can set up on most defensive bulky Water-type Pokemon for free, as well as on offensive variants as long as it is healthy and doesn't switch directly into their coverage moves. Additionally, Toxicroak can scare away Pokemon such as Florges, Chesnaught, and Mamoswine to create opportunities to set up. Using Gunk Shot or Knock Off without setting up to wear down some of Toxicroak's counters, such as Cresselia and Swampert, can help it sweep later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock helps Toxicroak wear down the opponent's team, and a good portion of its checks are weak to it. Swampert, Krookodile, and Bronzong make for good setters and can deal with some of Toxicroak's checks, such as Crobat, Cresselia, and Mega Aerodactyl, and they appreciate Toxicroak's immunity to Scald. Sticky Web support makes running an Adamant nature and using a coverage move over Sucker Punch on Toxicroak less risky. Hydreigon can deal with some of Toxicroak's checks and counters, such as Swampert, Reuniclus, and Doublade, and Toxicroak threatens some of Hydreigon's checks, which can be taken advantage of with double switches or U-turn. Infernape and Darmanitan are good teammates for Toxicroak, because they usually lure in Water-types and they both learn U-turn, allowing them to create chances for Toxicroak to safely switch in and set up or to weaken some of its most important checks. Whimsicott is a good teammate for Toxicroak, because it checks Dragon-type Pokemon, Swampert, and Krookodile and can use Stun Spore to cripple some of the checks it shares with Toxicroak, such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Toxicroak's Special Attack, which helps it beat some defensive Pokemon. Sludge Bomb is a strong, reliable STAB move that has a nice 30% poison chance, which can be used to wear down Toxicroak's checks and counters. Sludge Wave is slightly stronger, but it only has a 10% chance of poisoning. Vacuum Wave is mainly used for its priority, preventing Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Krookodile from checking this set reliably. Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon that either are bulky enough to easily handle Toxicroak's STAB moves or are immune to them, such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, and Doublade; however, the former easily survives a +2 Dark Pulse if healthy. Hidden Power Ice allows Toxicroak to break through Gligar and Nidoqueen, which resist both of its STAB types and are bulky enough to handle Dark Pulse. Focus Blast is by far Toxicroak's strongest move; at +2, it OHKOes Swampert, Porygon2, Snorlax, and even Blissey after Stealth Rock damage and does massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it. However, its low accuracy makes it fairly unreliable, and Toxicroak lacks the bulk to reliably deal with misses.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Toxicroak's Special Attack and Speed. A Timid nature is necessary to outspeed Chandelure and Speed tie with Nidoking, Heracross, and offensive Suicune. However, if you aren't worried about those Pokemon, a Modest nature can be used to boost Toxicroak's power. Life Orb's boost helps Toxicroak break through defensive Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Snorlax, but Black Sludge can be used to increase its longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main purpose of this set is wallbreaking; however, considering Swords Dance sets are significantly more common, this Toxicroak set can be used as a lure for Doublade, Reuniclus, or physical walls in general. Analyzing the opponent's team during Team Preview is important, as this allows you to find setup opportunities for Toxicroak and helps you decide how to proceed. Toxicroak can set up on most defensive bulky Water-type Pokemon and Umbreon for free, and if played carefully, it can set up on offensive Water-types too. Additionally, Toxicroak can scare away Pokemon such as Florges, Chesnaught, and Mamoswine to create opportunities to set up. Using Sludge Bomb without setting up to wear down some of Toxicroak's counters, such as Cresselia, can help it sweep later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock helps Toxicroak break through the opponent's team and wears down some of its checks, such as Crobat. Swampert, Krookodile, and Bronzong can set up Stealth Rock to support Toxicroak, can deal with some of its checks, such as Crobat, Cresselia, and Mega Aerodactyl, and appreciate Toxicroak's immunity to Scald. Sticky Web support reduces the risk of running a Modest nature and makes it easier for Toxicroak to drop Vacuum Wave for Focus Blast. Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Lucario and Mienshao, can work alongside Toxicroak, as they can take advantage of its ability to wear down or beat Pokemon such as Doublade, Reuniclus, and Cresselia. Infernape and Darmanitan are good teammates for Toxicroak, because they usually lure in Water-types and they both learn U-turn, allowing them to create chances for Toxicroak to safely switch in and set up or to weaken some of its most important checks.</p>"

      "Bulky Croak": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Toxicroak's Attack to decent levels, which is necessary to break through defensive cores. Drain Punch is the main attacking move of this set, because when it is combined with the bulk investment and Swords Dance, Toxicroak's longevity increases drastically. Gunk Shot is Toxicroak's secondary STAB move and its strongest move. Sucker Punch is for priority, which is extremely important on a set as slow as this one. Alternatively, Ice Punch allows Toxicroak to beat Gligar and punish Pokemon such as Nidoqueen trying to switch in for free, while Knock Off is good against Pokemon such as Doublade, Cresselia, and Reuniclus and allows Toxicroak to cripple most of the Pokemon that switch into it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Toxicroak's Attack and give it a good amount of bulk. The HP investment drastically improves Toxicroak's ability to deal with or switch into certain Pokemon, such as offensive Suicune, Mega Blastoise, Mega Sharpedo, Feraligatr, and Florges. Additionally, the increased bulk combined with Drain Punch and Swords Dance makes it really hard for some passive teams to defeat Toxicroak. An EV spread with more Speed investment in order to outspeed specific threats, such as Gligar, Cresselia, and Nidoqueen, can be used, but it's not advised to invest too many EVs in that stat, because this set needs the bulk to work properly. Should Speed be an issue, you're better off using an offensive Swords Dance set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set might be called Bulky Croak, but even with the HP investment, Toxicroak is relatively frail. However, this set works because of Toxicroak's unique set of resistances, ability to remove Toxic Spikes, and Dry Skin. This set should be used mainly in offensive teams that need help dealing with threats such as Suicune and Mega Sharpedo. Bulky Croak has significantly more longevity than other sets, which is important because as long as Toxicroak has not fainted, it'll passively threaten the opponent's team by deterring them from using Water-type moves recklessly. Gunk Shot or Knock Off can be used without setting up to wear down some of Toxicroak's checks and counters, such as Cresselia and Swampert.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A significant number of Toxicroak's checks and counters are weak to Stealth Rock, so Pokemon that can set it up, such as Mamoswine and Swampert, are good teammates. This set struggles against Ground-type Pokemon, so running Pokemon that can play around them to help Toxicroak, such as Hydreigon and Whimsicott, is advised. Most sweepers threatened by Scald or Water-type moves work well alongside Toxicroak, as they can take advantage of its ability to deal with some Water-type Pokemon and deter the opponent from using Scald as long as it has not fainted. Some of these sweepers are Mega Swampert, Lucario, and Mega Sharpedo.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Abomasnow has a great offensive typing, being able to threaten Water-types and top-tier threats such as Hydreigon, Mega Aerodactyl, and Crobat alike. While all these threats are faster than Abomasnow, it has a great priority move in Ice Shard, meaning it can pick off all of them fairly easily. Its typing gives it some nice resistances to Water, Ground, and Electric. It also can boost its Attack with Swords Dance quite easily, as it can force a lot of switches. Mega Abomasnow also gains a great Speed tier for Trick Room teams, as its abysmal base 30 Speed is one of the \"fastest\" Speed stats under Trick Room.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Mega Abomasnow has one of the worst defensive typings, which gives it common weaknesses to Fire, Fighting, and Flying and undermines its nice 90 / 105 / 105 bulk. Mega Abomasnow loses Speed, which can be great for Trick Room teams, but it isn't that great otherwise, as a lot of common UU walls, such as Umbreon, Alomomola, Florges, and Tentacruel, outspeed and can proceed to get a free Wish off against Mega Abomasnow or threaten it with a Scald or STAB Sludge Bomb in Tentacruel's case.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute and Leech Seed can provide Mega Abomasnow with a way to avoid status and give it a form of recovery; it also has an Ice-type STAB move to threaten the Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed. However, Abomasnow has one of the worst defensive typings in the game and can therefore be worn down easily. A specially defensive set can be used to take advantage of Abomasnow's nice resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass; however, while Mega Abomasnow has some useful resistances, it has too many weaknesses to truly take advantage of its solid 90 / 105 / 105 bulk. Hidden Power Fire is an option on the second set specifically to hit Forretress harder than any other move Mega Abomasnow has to offer, but every other Steel-type is hit harder by Focus Blast, and Earthquake hits both Steel- and Fire-types super effectively. Grass Knot is an option to hit heavy Pokemon, such as Mamoswine, harder than Giga Drain or Wood Hammer would, but most Pokemon are hit harder by Wood Hammer, and Mega Abomasnow likes the recovery Giga Drain can provide. Growth can be used to boost Abomasnow's Attack and Special Attack, which makes it more difficult for defensive teams to deal with.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock limits the number of times Mega Abomasnow can switch in, meaning it cannot set up or punch holes in the opposing team effectively.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Aggron can tank a +2 Earthquake and proceed to cripple Mega Abomasnow with Thunder Wave, though if Mega Aggron lacks Thunder Wave, Swords Dance Mega Abomasnow can overpower it. Bronzong can also wall Abomasnow, as it is immune to Earthquake thanks to its ability, Levitate, but it has the potential to be 2HKOed by Abomasnow's +2 Wood Hammer after Stealth Rock and hail damage. Assault Vest Escavalier is another threat, as it can tank any hit from Abomasnow and has a reliable, super effective STAB move to hit Abomasnow with; however, it cannot switch into a +2 Earthquake more than once, meaning it has to stay healthy to check Mega Abomasnow. Forretress is also worn down by a +2 Earthquake, as its only form of super effective damage is Gyro Ball, which is only a 4HKO thanks to Mega Abomasnow's abysmal base 30 Speed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Any Fire-types in UU, such as Entei and Darmanitan, resist Ice Shard and can proceed to OHKO Abomasnow with their STAB moves, but they do not like switching into Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienshao, Infernape, Heracross, and Machamp all outspeed and OHKO Mega Abomasnow. Infernape also resists both its STAB moves, but it hates Earthquake.</p>",

Wood Hammer is used to hit bulky Water-types hard, albeit with nasty recoil damage. Seed Bomb can be used instead if you don't like the recoil Wood Hammer brings, but you lose a lot of power. Ice Shard gives Abomasnow a powerful STAB move after Swords Dance and a form of priority. Earthquake hits the Steel-types that commonly switch into Mega Abomasnow.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs are used to take advantage of Mega Abomasnow's amazing power while 180 Speed EVs allow Mega Abomasnow to outspeed Relaxed Swampert. Abomasite is obligatory so that Abomasnow can Mega Evolve. An Adamant nature allows Mega Abomasnow to hit as hard as possible, especially after a Swords Dance boost. Soundproof isn't useful on this set, but it can come in handy for setup opportunities, as it blocks sound moves such as Bug Buzz, Hyper Voice, and Boomburst.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can work as both a wallbreaker and a win condition, as it hits hard initially and can proceed to overpower the opponent's team thanks to its access to Swords Dance. This set needs a ton of support to be truly effective, as its slow Speed stat and its bulk can only take it so far.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Entei or Life Orb Darmanitan, to wear down Steel-types while also hitting a lot of foes for a massive amount of damage. This set really appreciates Spikes support from Pokemon such as Chesnaught or Roserade to wear down the Steel-types that commonly switch in, as Mega Abomasnow can force a lot of switches thanks to its STAB coverage.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Blizzard is Abomasnow's most reliable STAB move in hail and is its most powerful STAB move. Wood Hammer is used to nail special walls trying to switch into Blizzard. Giga Drain is an option, however, to have a way of recovering and still hits targets that are weak to it such as Swampert and Alomomola pretty hard. Ice Shard gives Abomasnow a priority move that can nail a lot of faster threats that may threaten it. Earthquake is used to get around Steel-types not named Mega Aggron and Fire-types that try to switch into Abomasnow's STAB moves. Focus Blast can be used instead to hit Mega Aggron a bit harder, but it loses out on coverage against Fire-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to let Abomasnow hit as hard as it can with its most powerful STAB move, Blizzard. 180 Speed EVs allow Abomasnow to outspeed Relaxed Swampert. 8 HP EVs hit a Stealth Rock number, and the rest is dumped into Attack to let Abomasnow's other moves hit as hard as possible. Abomasite is given item, as otherwise Abomasnow cannot proceed to Mega Evolve. A Mild nature is used to boost Abomasnow's Special Attack while lowering its less important Defense, as Abomasnow's resistances are usually more specially based. Soundproof is used before Mega Evolution to avoid sound moves such as Yanmega's Bug Buzz or Exploud's Boomburst. It also allows for more hail turns for Mega Abomasnow to spam Blizzard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used on a bulky offensive team looking for a decent wallbreaker with priority. Abomasnow must be wary of any Pokemon faster than it that resists its priority or that it cannot afford to take a hit from, such as Entei or Darmanitan. Plan to bring this set out early- or mid-game to punch holes while softening up bulky foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick Room is a great option, as Mega Abomasnow's base 30 Speed allows it to outspeed almost everything in UU under Trick Room. Slowking is a particularly good partner as it has excellent defensive synergy with Mega Abomasnow, resisting Fire, Fighting, and Steel while Mega Abomasnow resists Grass and Electric; it can also set up Trick Room multiple times thanks to its ability Regenerator and its access to Slack Off. Entei is a good partner to form a wallbreaking core and it has great offensive and defensive synergy with Abomasnow. Abomasnow appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Tentacruel or Crobat, as both can get rid of all entry hazards fairly easily without compounding Abomasnow's weaknesses.</p>"

It also has an amazing movepool, including moves such as Megahorn, Superpower, and Ice Punch. However, Rhyperior's base 55 Special Defense means it is very weak to special attacks, and its typing leaves it weak to common special attacking types such as Water, Grass, and Ice. It also has an abysmal base 40 Speed, meaning Rhyperior must always take a hit before it can proceed to do anything.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Polish is a possibility, as with maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature, Rhyperior can outspeed Crobat at +2. However, Rhyperior is still too slow to take on Choice Scarf users and Mega Sceptile—the bulk is also much more welcome than the extra Speed. Swords Dance could be used on dedicated Trick Room teams, although Rhyperior is far too slow outside of Trick Room and held back by its low Special Defense. Metal Burst can be an option to punish both physical and special attackers trying to overpower Rhyperior, but it is unreliable for Pokemon trying to status or set up on Rhyperior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune and Swampert can tank most of Rhyperior's hits, although they do not like switching into a Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge or Earthquake.

Stone Edge, however, hits harder on average and has better consistency. Earthquake grants Rhyperior decent neutral coverage in UU. Roar allows Rhyperior to force out setup sweepers while also racking up entry hazard damage, although Dragon Tail can be used to phaze without worry of Taunt. Toxic can cripple switch-ins. Protect lets Rhyperior scout for possible coverage moves on Pokemon it otherwise walls, such as Aqua Tail on Mega Aerodactyl and Grass Knot on Infernape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP EVs allow Rhyperior to hit a Leftovers number, while the Attack EVs and an Adamant nature let it hit a jump point in its Attack stat. The rest is dumped into Special Defense because Rhyperior's high base Defense means investing in its physical bulk isn't as effective; also, the added special bulk allows it to survive some super effective hits that it isn't 4x weak to, such as Ice- and Ground-type attacks, thanks to Solid Rock. Solid Rock allows Rhyperior to tank a lot more hits and retaliate with its base 140 Attack. Leftovers gives Rhyperior a form of passive recovery, allowing it to continue being a threat throughout the match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can come in multiple times thanks to its nice bulk, then set up Stealth Rock easily.

This set must be brought in safely, as Rhyperior cannot tank as many hits because it is invested in offenses rather than defenses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates entry hazard support. Pokemon such as Tentacruel can absorb Toxic Spikes, lay down their own Toxic Spikes, and spin away other entry hazards in Tentacruel's case. Tentacruel also has decent synergy with Rhyperior, as they can tank Water- and Grass-types moves aimed at Rhyperior while Rhyperior can tank Electric-type moves aimed at Tentacruel. This set appreciates setup sweepers such as Lucario and Infernape, as Rhyperior can wear down walls fairly easily while Lucario and Infernape can clean up late-game. Grass- and Electric-types such as Celebi and Heliolisk can threaten out the bulky Water-types that Rhyperior has a hard time facing due to its fear of Scald and burn.</p>"

  "Yanmega": {
    "overview": "<p>Blessed with two great abilities in Speed Boost and Tinted Lens, Yanmega initially seems like a great choice for either a special wallbreaker or a cleaner. However, Yanmega's lack of power and mediocre STAB combination means that it often falls short in practice. In addition, a terrible Stealth Rock weakness and vulnerability to any form of priority makes it very difficult for Yanmega to perform either role. Yanmega's inability to break through common special walls such as Florges and Blissey makes other Pokemon like Infernape or Kyurem better wallbreakers, and better options for late-game cleaners Mega Sharpedo, Lucario, and various Choice Scarf users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Weakness Policy and Endure can be better than the typical Speed Boost set in some cases, as using Reversal can also help Yanmega break through Blissey; however, it is somewhat gimmicky and is outright useless if the foe has priority moves or does not use a super effective move. Psychic hits Nidoqueen, Crobat, and Tentacruel harder than Air Slash but provides no other coverage, making it another very situational move. Hypnosis is an option to surprise some of Yanmega's usual checks or counters, but the accuracy is a huge letdown and the loss of coverage is no good for Yanmega. Tailwind can be used as a last-ditch team support move, but once again, it is very hard to find a place for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey and Florges can tank anything Yanmega has on either set and heal off the damage.</p> <p><strong>Crobat</strong>: Crobat retains a resistance to Tinted Lens Bug Buzz because of its typing and can easily switch into Yanmega and KO it with Brave Bird. However, it takes a significant chunk from Choice Specs-boosted Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users such as Fletchinder, Honchkrow, and Cloyster can generally pick off Yanmega due to its frail defenses, although they don't have an easy time switching in.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock takes away half of Yanmega's health each time it switches in, and although this can be somewhat remedied by tweaking EVs so that Yanmega can switch in twice without fainting, it still makes Yanmega much easier to KO.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bug Buzz is a mandatory STAB move that is effectively unresisted because of Tinted Lens. Air Slash is another STAB move that provides coverage against Fighting-types and comes with a 30% flinch chance, although it is weaker than Bug Buzz. Giga Drain nails Swampert and Rhyperior, and it also hits other targets weak to it slightly harder than Bug Buzz. In the last slot, U-turn can be used to provide some momentum for your team and to let Yanmega avoid a potentially bad matchup. Sleep Talk is another option that can be used if you want a sleep absorber, though Sleep Powder is uncommon in UU.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed maximum Speed Nidoking, Roserade, Porygon-Z, and Krookodile. However, a Modest nature can be used to give some extra power, and could possibly net Yanmega 2HKOs against some walls such as Porygon2. Choice Specs makes Yanmega much better at performing its job of wallbreaking by boosting its damage output, while Tinted Lens is the ability chosen to make Yanmega's moves effectively unresisted, allowing it to do decent damage to Pokemon such as Empoleon on the switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Yanmega should generally be spamming its STAB moves, as Giga Drain isn't a good move to be Choice-locked into. Be especially wary of hard switching in Yanmega, as even neutral STAB moves can severely dent it. U-turn is a good move to use if you predict switch-ins that Yanmega cannot deal with, such as Florges and Blissey. Keep Stealth Rock off the field, as it will severely hamper Yanmega by taking away half of its health each time it switches in, which is a bigger problem with U-turn switches. Finally, try not to take too many risks by relying on Sleep Talk, as the number of turns that Yanmega will sleep for and what move it will pick are down to luck.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Yanmega's typing necessitates entry hazard removal, although the most common Defog and Rapid Spin users synergize badly with Yanmega. Tentacruel and Mega Blastoise are the best options, as Rapid Spin is preferred over Defog; Tentacruel can set Toxic Spikes to further wear down the likes of Florges and Porygon2, while Mega Blastoise in turn appreciates Yanmega wearing these targets down. Physical Pokemon such as Conkeldurr, Cobalion, and Krookodile are good teammates to U-turn out into on a predicted special wall. Faster teammates such as Mega Sceptile, Mega Houndoom, and Nasty Plot Vacuum Wave Infernape can take advantage of worn down special walls.</p>"
      },
      "Speed Boost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect lets Yanmega get a free Speed Boost, and as a result, outspeed most of the tier. Bug Buzz is a reliable STAB move and has high Base Power compared to the rest of Yanmega's moves. Air Slash is another STAB move that provides coverage and comes with a handy 30% flinch chance. Giga Drain lets Yanmega hit Water-types hard while also replenishing its own HP. Shadow Ball, on the other hand, gets useful super effective coverage against Doublade and Chandelure. Psychic can also be used to KO bulky Crobat after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs give Yanmega power and let it outspeed as many foes as it can. A Modest nature is preferred because Yanmega needs all the power it can get, and Speed Boost already makes Yanmega fast. Life Orb is the item of choice, as it boosts all of Yanmega's moves and allows it to change moves. Speed Boost is essential for pulling off a sweep, as it makes sure Yanmega gets harder to revenge kill without priority.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Yanmega can use Protect as a safe play on the first turn to get a free Speed Boost against faster opponents. Keep Stealth Rock off of Yanmega's side of the field to avoid ending Yanmega's sweep early due to Life Orb recoil. Try to save Yanmega for late-game because Speed Boost Yanmega has less wallbreaking capabilities than Tinted Lens variants but has an easier job cleaning with weakened checks and counters. Make sure you do not attempt a sweep while your opponent still has powerful priority users such as Crawdaunt and Entei, as they can easily take out Yanmega.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Reliable entry hazard removers are a must; Tentacruel is the best option as it can remove hazards from Yanmega's side of the field while setting Toxic Spikes on the opposing side. Pokemon such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Swords Dance Escavalier can wear down the Steel-types which wall this set. Mixed Tornadus can remove special walls such as Florges and Blissey. Entry hazard setters such as Krookodile and Roserade are good teammates because the chip damage makes it much easier for Yanmega to clean; Krookodile can also use a Choice Band set to support Yanmega by Pursuit trapping certain targets.</p>"

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is the most powerful Ground-type in the UnderUsed metagame, with an absolutely astounding base 130 Attack. Its typing comes as an offensive blessing and a defensive curse; Ice-type attacks are a huge bane to the UnderUsed tier, and Mamoswine makes perfect use of these weapons. Additionally, its Ground-typing grants Mamoswine near-perfect STAB coverage, allowing it to take down the majority of Fire- and Steel-types. Ice Shard is an extremely useful priority move, as it hits a lot of top threats super effectively and is backed up by Mamoswine's insane power. Mamoswine's power is so dependable that it can get away with running Focus Sash, allowing it to contribute as an effective lead, especially due to its access to Stealth Rock, Endeavor, and Ice Shard to get past other suicide leads. It is important to note that most of Mamoswine's drawbacks lie in its mediocre Speed and, more importantly, its poor defensive typing, providing it with a total of zero useful resistances and making it difficult to bring into the field. Furthermore, many faster Pokemon or priority users easily take advantage of Mamoswine if it is weakened, especially if they're not weak to Ice Shard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>In general, Choice items are not recommended, as the combination of Mamoswine's STAB types is what makes it so effective. While a Choice Scarf set can work, being locked into a single move can be detrimental for Mamoswine's success against poorer matchups, and the power loss as compared to either set listed above can be detrimental, as Choice Scarf Mamoswine will be forced to run a Jolly nature in order to outspeed appropriate threats, and its sheer Attack power suffers as a result. Choice Band can be used in order to hit insane levels of Attack, but, once again, being locked into a single move typically hurts Mamoswine more than the added power helps it. However, it should be noted that Ice Shard cleans up far more effectively with this set than the Life Orb set, as the lack of recoil damage and added power make it the strongest Ice Shard in the game. In terms of moves, Stone Edge can be run, as it smashes an important Fire-type, Rotom-H. Freeze-Dry isn't recommended because Earthquake does more damage to almost every relevant Water-type.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Swampert, Suicune, and defensive Gyarados can easily outplay Mamoswine, forcing Mamoswine to either sacrifice itself in exchange for some revenge kill damage or be set up on via Stealth Rock, Calm Mind, or Wish.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Entei, Darmanitan, Chandelure, and Rotom-H can switch into an Ice Shard and pressure Mamoswine with their powerful STAB moves, as Mamoswine's lacklustre defenses cannot take a super effective hit even with Thick Fat. In particular, Rotom-H is immune to Earthquake and can easily OHKO Mamoswine.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Although some frailer Fighting-types such as Mienshao have to be wary of a powerful Ice Shard, Fighting-types with a useful secondary typing, such as Cobalion, Lucario, and Infernape, do not fear the mammoth's Ice-type attacks and will OHKO with their speedy and powerful Close Combats.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Celebi and Choice Specs Kyurem easily wallbreak past Mamoswine with their massive special attacking power.</p> <p><strong>Cresselia</strong>: With access to Levitate, Moonlight, and huge natural bulk, Cresselia can usually outlast Mamoswine's flinch attempts and reliably stall it out, as Mamoswine will eventually faint due to recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong and Forretress</strong>: With Bronzong's access to Levitate and Forretress' useful secondary Bug-typing, Bronzong and Forretress can generally handle anything the mammoth can send their way, and they can take out Mamoswine with a couple Gyro Balls; however, Bronzong does have to be careful of a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Shard's power gets boosted to high levels with Life Orb, allowing Mamoswine to revenge kill many Grass- and Flying-types after some prior damage. Ice Shard is also effective against Dragon- and Ground-types such as Hydreigon and Krookodile. Earthquake is Mamoswine's primary STAB move and is able to 2HKO a large portion of the tier. Icicle Crash provides excellent coverage in tandem with Earthquake and can even provide free turns thanks to its 30% flinch rate. Icicle Crash also gives Mamoswine a reasonable method of getting past Grass- and Flying-types, such as Chesnaught and Crobat. Knock Off is excellent both as a coverage move and as a utility move, hitting for massive damage against Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Bronzong. Knock Off also removes Leftovers and Eviolite from bulkier threats, including Suicune and Porygon2. Superpower should generally only be used in combination with Knock Off instead of Icicle Crash, as the combined coverage of Earthquake and Icicle Crash is typically sufficient to deal with most threats, leaving Superpower's coverage redundant. However, if you do opt to use Superpower, Mamoswine can take on Umbreon, Porygon2, and Snorlax with relative ease. Lastly, if coverage is unimportant for your requirements, Stealth Rock is a perfectly viable option in order to capitalize on forced switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack is required for Mamoswine to wallbreak as easily as possible. Maximum Speed is required so that, at the very least, Mamoswine can force the Speed tie against other base 80s such as Chandelure. As such, a Jolly nature is preferable for this particular set, although Adamant can be used in order to dish out more damage. It is relevant to note that Adamant Ice Shard does have a very high chance of OHKOing many offensive Flying-types, including Crobat and Honchkrow, after Stealth Rock damage. However, Jolly is still the preferred option in order to outspeed a plethora of threats such as neutral-natured base 90s, Modest Nidoking, Jolly Feraligatr, and Adamant Heracross. Life Orb increases Mamoswine's already huge power to an insane level and makes it easier to clean up with Ice Shard late-game, although you must be wary of the recoil and any potential priority users on the opponent's team. Thick Fat is the most workable of Mamoswine's abilities, providing minor insurance against less powerful Fire-type attacks, as well as an effective pseudo-resistance against Ice-type attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mamoswine hits like a truck, and it has the highest Attack stat of all physical Ground-types in the tier, barring Mega Swampert. Earthquake on its own has fantastic coverage and should be the go-to move for wallbreaking, while Ice Shard is Mamoswine's go-to move for an easy revenge kill. In general, Mamoswine creates so much offensive pressure that your opponent will be hard pressed not to find something to sacrifice. Mamoswine's great wallbreaking power can be used to bust holes in the opponent's team to open up a sweep for its teammates. However, base 80 Speed is extremely underwhelming in such a fast tier, and it is important to use appropriate teammates to ensure that Mamoswine sticks around for as long as possible, as it can easily clean up late-game with Ice Shard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mamoswine serves as a wallbreaker, so it is best to partner up with suitable balance or bulky cores, including pivots that can safely bring it in, such as Mega Ampharos, Forretress, and Mandibuzz. Mamoswine pairs up fantastically with bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Mega Blastoise, and Tentacruel, which can check Mamoswine's counters including Mega Aggron, Swampert, and Alomomola. Bulky Water-types can also take Fire- and Fighting-type moves aimed at Mamoswine from Pokemon such as Entei, Darmanitan, Infernape, and Mienshao. Late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Lucario, Feraligatr, Mega Sharpedo, and Mega Beedrill greatly appreciate Mamoswine's wallbreaking power. It is always best to prepare for Fighting-types when using Mamoswine on your team; Crobat is an adequate check against all popular Fighting-types in the tier and has access to U-turn, although Mandibuzz can generally handle the pressure just as well and doesn't succumb to Stone Edges and Ice Punches nearly as easily. Mamoswine is quite weak to entry hazards, so Defog users and Pokemon that can absorb Toxic Spikes such as Roserade or Toxicroak are appreciated.</p>"

      "Sash Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mamoswine is slower than most sweepers but faster than most Pokemon that carry Stealth Rock. As a result, it can effectively lure many bulky Pokemon and use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, potentially switching out afterwards to be saved for later. Ice Shard is Mamoswine's saving grace, allowing it to revenge kill a threat or clean up if needed. Ice Shard also works well in combination with Earthquake, usually finishing off most frailer Pokemon. Earthquake is Mamoswine's main STAB move and most reliable form of distributing damage. The last slot is a matter of preference, as each of the listed moves has competitive viability. Knock Off provides Mamoswine with additional utility, and it can sometimes be instrumental in disrupting a foe's sweep if it relies on Leftovers recovery. Endeavor works well on this set, especially if Mamoswine is facing bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune. In particular, it can allow Mamoswine to bait offensive checks into attacking and finish them off with Ice Shard, although this takes a little bit of anticipation. Icicle Crash is Mamoswine's secondary STAB move and offers good coverage with Earthquake, as well as a reasonable 30% flinch rate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs investment suits Mamoswine's purpose of hitting hard and being faster than most other Stealth Rock users. Maximum Speed is required so that, at the very least, Mamoswine can force the Speed tie against other base 80s such as Chandelure, and outspeed neutral-natured base 85s such as Heracross and Nidoking. As such, a Jolly nature is preferable for this particular set, although Adamant can be used in order to dish out more damage. Focus Sash is used in order to ensure that Mamoswine gets either the guaranteed Stealth Rock or the extra Earthquake. Oblivious ensures that Mamoswine sets up Stealth Rock by rendering Taunt useless. Thick Fat can be used if you prefer to focus on Mamoswine's bulk, although Oblivious is the superior option for this set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is generally best used as a lead, although depending on the team it may be best to save Mamoswine for a late-game cleanup, especially if you have reasonable entry hazard control. Set up Stealth Rock and proceed to either attempt to wallbreak or switch out, depending on the matchup. Keep in mind that this set is rather uncomplicated, and the sheer power of Mamoswine's attacks is generally a giveaway of this set's details.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mamoswine works best with offensive teams and does a fantastic job at supporting its teammates, especially near the very beginning of the battle as a lead or near the end of the battle as a cleaner. Many sweepers, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, Feraligatr, Lucario, and Entei, appreciate the Stealth Rock that Mamoswine sets up in order to wear down their foes. Feraligatr, in particular, is an incredible offensive partner for its capacity to both wallbreak and clean. Other decent offensive Water-type options include Mega Blastoise, Mega Swampert, and Suicune for their ability to place adequate offensive pressure on an opponent's team while maintaining a high level of natural bulk for your team.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>The premier offensive duck of UU, Porygon-Z makes for an effective sweeper, wallbreaker, and revenge killer. It has decent Speed, an incredible ability in Adaptability, and a very high Special Attack stat, allowing it to hit extremely hard and relatively quickly with Tri Attack. After a Nasty Plot boost, there are few Pokemon that can comfortably take attacks from Porygon-Z, and after an Agility boost, not many Pokemon that can outspeed it. Also, because of its power and access to Trick, it makes for an effective user of Choice items such as Choice Scarf and Choice Specs. To back its extreme power, Porygon-Z has a wide movepool with coverage options such as Dark Pulse, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt. However, Porygon-Z is rather frail, falling to any decently powerful neutral attack. Also, its Tri Attack is resisted by many common Pokemon in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Agility + three attacks set can be used to demolish offensive teams, but it struggles against defensive ones and it can be hard to set up against offensive pressure. Similarly, Nasty Plot + three attacks can be used to smash defensive teams, but Porygon-Z is too slow to put in work against offensive ones. 140 Attack EVs can be used with Return to 2HKO Blissey after a Download boost, but special attacking sets are much more reliable and useful. However, the flinch chance of Dark Pulse usually makes it the preferred choice. Psyshock can be used to have an easier time against special walls, but Porygon-Z's other moves get better coverage and are generally more useful. Finally, Recover can be used with three attacks to help break down stall teams more easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types can OHKO Porygon-Z with any of their STAB moves. Infernape and Mienshao get a special mention for their ability to outspeed and OHKO Porygon-Z if they are running Choice Scarf, unless Porygon-Z has set up Agility. However, they can't switch in because of Porygon-Z's incredible power.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Blissey can take anything from Porygon-Z except a +2 Life Orb Tri Attack through its sheer bulk and wear it down with Seismic Toss. It does need to be wary of Trick, however. Also, Snorlax is a good check for being able to take a +2 Modest Life Orb Tri Attack and hit back hard.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Empoleon takes anything except a +2 Life Orb Tri Attack or Choice Specs Thunderbolt and can phaze Porygon-Z, set up Stealth Rock, or use Defog. That said, it does not like being Tricked a Choice item. Mega Aggron can take a single +2 Modest Life Orb Tri Attack and hit back hard without fear of being Tricked an item. Finally, Escavalier makes for a decent check by surviving one attack and retaliating with a powerful STAB move.</p>",

Agility doubles Porygon-Z's Speed so that it can outspeed most Pokemon on offensive teams and hit them hard. Tri Attack is Porygon-Z's most powerful STAB move and is boosted by Adaptability, allowing it to put a major dent in many Pokemon even when unboosted. Dark Pulse, alongside Tri Attack, receives perfect neutral coverage among all relevant Pokemon in UU with the exceptions of Lucario and Cobalion. Thunderbolt, however, can be used in the last moveslot to hit every bulky Water-type in UU except Swampert harder as well as hit Steel-types slightly harder than Tri Attack.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs provide just enough Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Infernape after a single boost with Agility. Special Attack is maximized with a Modest nature to increase Porygon-Z's wallbreaking potential. The rest of the EVs are placed in HP to provide a little extra bulk, though the increase is marginal. Adaptability is more reliable than Download and makes Tri Attack as powerful as possible. Life Orb allows Porygon-Z to dish out more damage and scores many KOs that Lum Berry wouldn't let it get, but Lum Berry allows Porygon-Z to set up on more walls and prevents it from being crippled by status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against slower, more defensive teams, try to set up Nasty Plot to demolish walls, as at +2, Porygon-Z can punch giant holes in common defensive cores. In fact, with a Life Orb, a +2 Adaptability Tri Attack can 2HKO Blissey, which is an amazing feat for a special attacker. Against more offensive teams, try to set up Agility to outspeed and KO weakened threats. Try to set up against more passive Pokemon such as Blissey and Umbreon. Also, Porygon-Z can set up easily against Chandelure if it is locked into Shadow Ball.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Heracross, Machamp, Infernape, and Toxicroak all make for good partners for Porygon-Z, as they can easily take out threats such as Empoleon, Mega Aggron, Umbreon, and Blissey. Poison-types such as Nidoqueen and Roserade are helpful for their ability to take on Florges. They can also provide entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes, respectively, and both can run Toxic Spikes. Pokemon such as Sylveon and Crobat make for good partners for their ability to take on the Fighting-types that can trouble Porygon-Z.</p>"

Dark Pulse is useful for hitting the Ghost-types that are immune to Tri Attack super effectively, and it also has a chance to cause the foe to flinch, which can come in handy in a pinch. Alternatively, Shadow Ball can be used since it provides mostly the same coverage as Dark Pulse while hitting certain key Pokemon, such as Lucario and Cobalion, harder, although it lacks a flinch chance. Thunderbolt can be used in the third slot to hit Water- and Flying-types bar Swampert and Gligar super effectively and is also Porygon-Z's best option against Steel-types. Ice Beam retains coverage against Flying-types and hits Dragon-, Grass-, and Ground-types super effectively, but it doesn't get neutral coverage against Steel-types. Trick is recommended in the last slot to cripple walls such as Umbreon and Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Porygon-Z's Special Attack and Speed, allowing it to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. Choice Specs is used for the wallbreaking power it provides in conjunction with Porygon-Z's fairly high base 135 Special Attack and Adaptability-boosted Tri Attack. A Timid nature can be used to Speed tie with base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Roserade and outspeed other Pokemon just below that Speed tier such as Rotom-H and Rotom-C, but a Modest nature can be used for a higher chance to 2HKO Florges as well as a chance to 2HKO Umbreon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to bring Porygon-Z in off of a slow U-turn, Volt Switch, or fainted teammate, as Porygon-Z is rather frail and will fall easily to any powerful hit.

  "Froslass": {
    "overview": "<p>Froslass is a fantastic Spiker for offensive teams, as it can block Rapid Spin and its high base 110 Speed allows it to set up at least 1 layer of Spikes in most situations. It also gets access to a plethora of support moves, such as Thunder Wave and Taunt. For these reasons, it is also a great lead. However, Froslass is an extremely frail Pokemon, as it has poor defensive stats and cannot take any decently strong attack if its Focus Sash is broken.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Ball and Ice Beam are alternatives for strong STAB moves over Icy Wind, although they provide less utility than Icy Wind. Pain Split can be used to give Froslass some longevity so that Froslass can gain a bit of health back. Froslass can use Pain Split on switch-ins, which gives it a tiny bit of longevity. A more offensive Spiker moveset with Spikes / Ice Shard / Ice Beam / Shadow Ball or Thunderbolt can be used for Froslass as well, allowing it to threaten more Pokemon with its increased coverage. Mental Herb is another item option for Froslass that allows it to not get affected by Taunt from Sableye and Suicide Lead Aerodactyl, and Taunt them back. This prevents them from Taunting Froslass or setting their own entry hazards up, allowing Froslass to set up Spikes relatively freely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: If Froslass has Thunder Wave, then a faster Taunt from Pokemon such as Sableye and Aerodactyl completely shuts it down.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Magic Bouncers such as Mega Absol can also beat Froslass if it doesn't run an attacking move.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Hit Moves</strong>: Pokemon such as Cloyster can easily KO Froslass with their multi-hit moves, as these attacks break its Focus Sash and KO it in one turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is pretty much the only reason why you would want to use Froslass. Destiny Bond allows Froslass to take down other Pokemon, especially Rapid Spin users, along with it after Focus Sash is used up. Taunt allows it to prevent slower leads from setting up their entry hazards and blocks slower Taunts. The last moveslot is a toss up between Thunder Wave and Icy Wind. Icy Wind works on a similar principle as Thunder Wave and prevents Froslass from becoming Taunt bait. Thunder Wave allows Froslass to shut down fast Pokemon as they try to set up and works well with Taunt and Destiny Bond.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The preferred item for Froslass is Focus Sash, which allows it to set up at least one layer of Spikes. Timid is used so that it can maximize its Speed for using Taunt and Destiny Bond. Cursed Body allows Froslass to set up an additional layer of Spikes against Choice-locked Pokemon 30% of the time. The 252 HP EVs are used to maximize Froslass' bulk, although if Icy Wind, Ice Beam, or Shadow Ball is used over Thunder Wave, the EVs may be moved into Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Froslass sets up Spikes then KOes a foe with Destiny Bond or prevents Defog with Taunt and blocks Rapid Spin with its Ghost typing. Froslass should be sent out at the beginning of the match or at least close to the beginning to make the most out of Spikes. The main goal of this set is to set up as many layers of Spikes as possible, so avoid using any other moves unless absolutely required. Froslass is decently useful mid game, as it is able to revenge kill Dragons, and with its great Speed and adequate Special Attack it could pose a threat to offensive teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can stop Rapid Spin and Defog users after Froslass is gone are appreciated, so Pokemon such as Sableye and Doublade make for nice partners because of this. Fast Taunters such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat are also appreciated. Anything that takes advantage of the Spikes that Froslass sets also appreciates its support, such as Mega Sharpedo or Lucario. Stealth Rock users such as Aerodactyl or Swampert also make for good partners.</p>"

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-H has a great typing, garnering eight resistances, an immunity, and only two weaknesses. Not only that, but Rotom-H's STAB Fire- and Electric-type coverage is nearly unresisted in the UU metagame and also provides Rotom-H with immunities to burn and paralysis. It also has decent stats with 107 / 107 defenses and a nice base 105 Special Attack stat. Levitate is a great ability, as it makes Rotom-H the only Fire-type in UU that is not weak to Ground-type moves. Rotom-H has great support moves in Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Pain Split, and Trick while also being able to go on the offensive with powerful STAB moves in Thunderbolt, Volt Switch, and Overheat and a Hidden Power of its choice.</p> <p>Although Rotom-H has great 107 / 107 defenses, it is held back by its horrible base 50 HP stat, which backfires in many situations. Another drawback is that Rotom-H has a weakness to Stealth Rock, meaning it can only switch in four times at max unless the team has a way to clear entry hazards. Not only that, but its main Fire-type STAB move, Overheat, cripples Rotom-H by lowering its Special Attack by two stages, forcing Rotom-H to switch out more often than it wants to. Additionally, Rotom-H has no reliable recovery outside of Pain Split, so it can be worn down easily without team support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>ChestoRest is a more reliable way of allowing Rotom-H to recover health and get rid of status. However, it only works once and Rotom-H is already immune to paralysis and burn, so the only status that truly affects Rotom-H is Toxic. A SubSplit set is plausible; however, Rotom-H has better options and doesn't get as much use out of Substitute as the only status Substitute protects it from is Toxic. Toxic can itself be an option on the defensive set to whittle down the Fire-types that tend to switch in to absorb Will-O-Wisp. Trick + Flame Orb can catch some Pokemon off-guard as it can easily burn the opposing Pokemon and reliably keep the burn on them even if they have Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support. However, most Pokemon that Rotom-H checks are Fire-types, which are immune to burn. Also Guts users such as Heracross and Machamp would appreciate the Flame Orb boosting their Attack to stupidly high levels.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Haxorus, and Mega Ampharos all resist Rotom-H's STAB types. Hydreigon and Mega Ampharos can gather free momentum via U-turn or Volt Switch. Haxorus can easily break through, as it tends to carry Lum Berry and has Mold Breaker Earthquake to bypass Rotom-H's Levitate. Though it doesn't like taking Overheat, Mega Sceptile is a decent check, as it is faster and gains a +1 Special Attack boost from Volt Switch thanks to Lightning Rod, and it can even survive an Overheat if it is healthy.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is the bane of Rotom-H's existence. While Rotom-H does avoid other entry hazards due to its ability, it suffers from a Stealth Rock weakness and thus has a limited number of times it can switch into opposing attacks even if running the defensive set, as Pain Split is only semi-reliable. The Choice Specs and Choice Scarf set are even further pressured for switching, as they have no way to recover their HP. This limits just how much Rotom-H can reliably switch in, tank hits, and keep up the momentum via Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although Rotom-H can threaten Water-types with its Electric-type STAB moves, most Water-types can still check it. Bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune can threaten Rotom-H with their own STAB moves and Rotom-H usually cannot break them, as Swampert is immune to Volt Switch and resists Overheat whereas Suicune can boost its Special Defense via Calm Mind while also Resting off the damage. Faster Water-types such as Mega Sharpedo can outright OHKO Rotom-H before it can do anything to Mega Sharpedo.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Users</strong>: Common users of Assault Vest, such as Conkeldurr, can easily tank any of Rotom-H's hits, thus gaining the upper hand against Rotom-H.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls, such as Blissey and Florges, can easily take anything Rotom-H has to offer, as they can get rid of status and take little damage from its attacks. These special walls, however, have to be wary of Trick on the Choice Specs and Choice Scarf set.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat is a great nuke, nailing the Grass- and Steel-types that are weak to it and Ground-types which are immune to Volt Switch. Volt Switch is used as the obligatory momentum move, allowing Rotom-H to not be setup bait, although it doesn't hit as hard as the offensive sets. Will-O-Wisp is a great status move, crippling physical attackers that Rotom-H tends to switch into. Thunder Wave is another option, stopping cold a lot of faster offensive Pokemon that you may struggle with. Pain Split is Rotom-H's only recovery move and while it isn't the best, it allows Rotom-H to outstall the Pokemon that may try to wear it down or spam a neutral STAB move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set utilizes Rotom-H's useful resistances, bulk, and ability to check a plethora of Pokemon in the UU metagame. 208 Speed EVs with a Timid nature are important to outspeed Jolly Mamoswine and Feraligatr and burn them before they can attack. 248 HP EVs are used to maximize bulk and allow Rotom-H to switch into Stealth Rock four times. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense, allowing Rotom-H to check common physical attackers such as Entei, Darmanitan, and Crobat.</p> <p>Alternatively, an EV spread of 248 HP / 124 Def / 136 Spe with a Bold nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow, while packing more physical bulk in order to more effectively sponge hits from physical attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is aimed at taking advantage of Rotom-H's great typing and bulk to either burn physical attackers or paralyze faster Pokemon. It also forces out a lot of Pokemon, which pairs up greatly with Rotom-H's access to Volt Switch. If the foe has a lot of HP, Pain Split can wear it down while subsequently healing Rotom-H up to allow it to continue to do its job. This set also checks a lot of physical attackers in UU such as Entei, Darmanitan, Mega Beedrill, and Infernape, thanks to its typing, bulk, and access to great status moves in Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Rotom-H can also grab easy momentum off of Fire-types that try to switch in and absorb Will-O-Wisp, thanks to Volt Switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates special walls to complement Rotom-H's physical EV investment. Blissey and Florges are great partners, as they can provide Wish support for Rotom-H. Defog Empoleon is an exceptionally good special wall to pair with Rotom-H, as Empoleon can take the Rock- and Water-type moves aimed at Rotom-H while Rotom-H can take on the Electric- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Empoleon. Empoleon can also get rid of Stealth Rock, which allows Rotom-H to switch in more often and stay around for the majority of the game. This set can also be a great supporter to a lot of setup sweepers in UU such as Swords Dance Heracross, Swords Dance Haxorus, and Calm Mind Florges, all of which appreciate Rotom-H's ability to cripple faster Pokemon and physical attackers.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Rotom-H to hit hard and grab easy momentum for the team. Overheat is an amazing nuke, allowing Rotom-H to hit Ground-types which are immune to its other STAB move, while roasting Grass- and Steel-types. The next slot is up to preference; Thunderbolt offers a more powerful and reliable STAB attack than Volt Switch or Overheat, while Hidden Power Grass hits Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon, all of which resist Overheat and are immune to Volt Switch. Hidden Power Ice can be used instead to hit Dragon-types that resist Rotom-H's STAB moves, such as Hydreigon. Trick allows Rotom-H to cripple special walls, such as Blissey or Florges, which tend to switch in and tank Rotom-H's attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs, along with maximum Special Attack EVs and Speed EVs, allow Rotom-H to hit as hard and as fast as it can. Timid is preferred to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Heracross, Toxicroak, and Nidoking. However, Modest can be used for more firepower to nab some OHKOs and 2HKOs more easily. This set acts as a wallbreaker that can gain some easy momentum through Volt Switch or Trick. A bulkier spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe can be used to outpace Honchkrow while also being able to tank weaker hits such as Florges's Moonblast more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-H can break walls a lot easier with this set than its other sets while still gaining momentum via Volt Switch, allowing Rotom-H to hit hard and wear down the opponent's team at the same time. This set partners well with VoltTurn cores, as most of them can bring Rotom-H in safely and allow it to wreak havoc on the opponent's team. This set, however, isn't as fast as the Choice Scarf set, which means it may have to take a hit before attacking or rely on forced switches to stay alive. Avoid bringing Rotom-H in while Stealth Rock is up, as it wears Rotom-H down very quickly and the opponent can proceed to overpower it. Try to use Volt Switch early-game as once the opponent knows your set, they will try to bring a Ground-type into Volt Switch, sucking away all the momentum you may have gained.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates setup sweepers that can benefit from walls being crippled or broken down. Pokemon such as Swords Dance Heracross and Bulk Up Conkeldurr appreciate Rotom-H's ease in wearing down their checks and counters while also nuking Steel-types that tend to wall Pokemon like Florges. This set appreciates entry hazard support as well, as Rotom-H can easily force switches thanks to a great STAB type combination. Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Forretress can easily set up Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes, and even Spikes in Forretress's case, allowing Rotom-H to take advantage of the entry hazards.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rotom-H's great STAB coverage backed by a decent base 86 Speed stat allows it to be a great contender for a revenge killer. Volt Switch is an amazing STAB move that can grant the team some momentum while wearing down the opponent's team and forcing switches. Overheat is another STAB move, allowing Rotom-H to nuke Ground- and Grass-types that may try to switch into Volt Switch. Unfortunately, it isn't as spammable as Volt Switch due to it lowering Rotom-H's Special Attack by two stages. Hidden Power Ice is used for Dragon-types that resist Rotom-H's STAB moves. Will-O-Wisp can be used if you are worried about physical attackers or are not in need of the coverage Hidden Power Ice provides. Thunderbolt can also be used as it offers a more powerful and reliable STAB attack than Volt Switch or Overheat. Trick is mandatory, allowing Rotom-H to cripple walls that can switch into Rotom-H's moves and proceed to recover or wear it down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Choice Scarf, thanks to Rotom-H's base 86 Speed, allow Rotom-H to outspeed Choice Scarf Heracross and Choice Scarf Chandelure if running a Timid nature. Alternatively, a Modest nature may be used to increase Rotom-H's output, but it sacrifices Rotom-H's ability to outspeed Jolly Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set functions as a great momentum grabber early-game. With a fast Volt Switch, it can chip at the foe's health and whittle the opponent's team down, allowing your team to clean up later in the game. However, Rotom-H should be wary of being locked into Overheat, as many UU Pokemon, such as Flash Fire Chandelure and Mega Blastoise can take advantage of it and proceed to suck the momentum that Rotom-H may have gathered earlier in the game. Rotom-H should also save Trick until mid- to late-game, as Tricking Choice Scarf early-game severely hinders Rotom-H's ability to revenge kill; furthermore, if the Choice Scarf is Tricked onto the wrong Pokemon, it can be detrimental to Rotom-H and its team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates entry hazard support as well as Rapid Spin or Defog support. Forretress is a great partner, as its only weakness is resisted by Rotom-H and it can provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support while spinning away Stealth Rock, which hinders Rotom-H's existence. This set appreciates wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Goodra, to break the walls it has worn down via Volt Switch and forced switches.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-C possesses a great offensive typing that allows it to deal with the numerous Water-type Pokemon in the tier. This is further aided by its good Special Attack and all-around good bulk. It faces competition from other Electric-types in the tier such as Rotom-H and Heliolisk, but it stands out due to its unique typing and its Grass-type STAB move that allows it to beat Ground-types more easily. However, it doesn't have a way to effectively deal with opposing Grass-types and lacks reliable recovery. Regardless, it's still very effective as a revenge killer or pivot in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster switch-ins such as Hydreigon. A dual screens set can make use of Rotom-C's set of resistances to find opportunities to set them up. RestTalk and ChestoRest sets can be used to increase longevity and shrug off status ailments.</p> <p>A bulky attacker set with the moves Volt Switch / Leaf Storm / Will-o-Wisp / Pain Split allows Rotom-C to take advantage of its unique resistances and cripple physical attackers while also being able to take care of Ground-types that try to block its Volt Switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types easily take Rotom-C's STAB moves, so it has to rely on Hidden Power Ice to hit them, if it carries it. Roserade is a great answer to Rotom-C, taking hits and threatening it out with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Infernape, Darmanitan, and Entei, all threaten Rotom-C with their STAB moves, while Rotom-C can only Volt Switch out. Darmanitan and Infernape also have access to U-turn, which either will deal significant damage to Rotom-C or maintain momentum should it switch. Rotom-H, in particular, is a huge threat, resisting both of Rotom-C's STAB moves and threatening to OHKO with Overheat in return. Rotom-H can also choose to Volt Switch on predicted switches.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types can easily switch in on most of Rotom-C's moves and proceed to do major damage back. Hydreigon resists Rotom-C's STAB moves and can fire off powerful attacks once it's in. Goodra also deserves a mention for resisting Volt Switch and Thunderbolt while being immune to Leaf Storm due to Sap Sipper.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Special Walls</strong>: Rotom-C has trouble breaking through any of the special walls in the tier such as Blissey, Florges, and Umbreon. However, they have to be wary of Trick from Rotom-C.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mienshao, Hydreigon, Infernape, and Darmanitan are major threats to Rotom-C, as they are able to outspeed it and do significant damage back. They also commonly carry a Choice Scarf, so they can even outspeed Choice Scarf variants of Rotom-C. U-turn from these Pokemon by itself would dent Rotom-C.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch maintains momentum for the team. Leaf Storm hits ridiculously hard when coupled with the boost from Choice Specs. Thunderbolt provides a good and reliable Electric-type STAB move alongside Volt Switch. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit opposing Grass-types and Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, which resist Rotom-C's STAB combination. Will-O-Wisp is a valid choice for this slot, but it's risky to be locked into such a move, so it's mainly used after Rotom-C has Tricked away its Choice Specs. Trick is used to cripple dedicated special walls such as Blissey that like to switch into Rotom-C.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs is used to boost Rotom-C's already good Special Attack, making it a fearsome offensive pivot. Maximum EVs are invested into Special Attack and Speed so Rotom-C can hit as hard and fast as possible. Timid is the preferred nature to outspeed threats such as Nidoking, Chandelure, and Mamoswine, which can OHKO Rotom-C with their respective STAB moves. However, you can opt for a Modest nature if you would like the extra boost in power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is based around Rotom-C being a very hard-hitting offensive pivot. It should make use of its ability to take Water- and Ground-type moves easily to switch in. It has to watch out for Ice Beam on Water-types, though. Go for Volt Switch if there are dedicated special walls ready to switch in so as to keep momentum on your side. Tricking away the Choice Specs to these walls is also an option should you not need the boost in power for the rest of the game. Leaf Storm should be used if you predict a Ground-type switching in to take a Volt Switch or Thunderbolt. However, do not be reckless with spamming Leaf Storm, as Rotom-C could become easy setup fodder if it's locked into it. The hit-and-run nature of this set somewhat alleviates that. If you decide to run Will-O-Wisp, avoid getting locked into it while still holding the Choice Specs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-C usually switches in and out numerous times as a pivot, so it'd be easily worn down by Stealth Rock. Hence entry hazard removal is very important. Entry hazard support is also good to have, as Rotom-C forces a significant number of switches. A notable partner for this is Tentacruel, resisting Ice-, Poison-, and Fire-type moves that Rotom-C is weak to. Rotom-C can't do much to dedicated special walls such as Florges and Blissey, so strong physical attackers, such as Darmanitan and Infernape, are appreciated. These Pokemon also provide a nice VoltTurn core with Rotom-C and appreciate having bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Suicune and Gligar removed. Their ability to take out opposing Grass-types that resist Rotom-C's STAB combination, most notably Mega Sceptile due to Lightning Rod, also helps. Cleaners, such as Life Orb Yanmega and Mega Sharpedo, make nice partners to finish up the game once Rotom-C has sufficiently weakened the opposing team.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch comes in handy as a momentum grabber. Leaf Storm is used as a powerful Grass-type STAB move that hits Ground-types immune to Rotom-C's Electric-type moves. Thunderbolt is a more reliable STAB move that, unlike Leaf Storm, has no drawback. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon that tend to try to switch into Rotom-C. Will-O-Wisp can be run instead of Thunderbolt, mainly to be used after the Choice Scarf is Tricked away, to further cripple Pokemon that try to switch in. Signal Beam can be an option to hit Celebi and Mega Sceptile hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EVs are invested into Special Attack and Speed to make Rotom-C as fast as possible while still hitting reasonably hard. A Timid nature is optimal, as it allows Rotom-C to outspeed threats such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl. A Choice Scarf allows it to act as a good offensive pivot, easily grabbing momentum with Volt Switch while doubling as a strong revenge killer.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The Choice Scarf set is mainly used as a revenge killer, so bring it in after one of your Pokemon has been knocked out. Make use of Rotom-C's nice set of resistances to net good opportunities to switch in . Volt Switch grants the most utility among its moves, doing decent damage while maintaining momentum should your opponent switch out. Thunderbolt can be used to clean up the opponent's team once it has been sufficiently weakened. Leaf Storm should be used on predicted Ground-type switch-ins, but minimize locking Rotom-C into it to avoid being setup fodder. Use Trick on predicted switches to cripple walls, provided you no longer require the Speed boost from the Choice Scarf.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Crobat, and Tentacruel is important to prevent Rotom-C from being easily worn down by Stealth Rock. Tentacruel can also set up Toxic Spikes to further wear down the opposing team in combination with Volt Switch. As a fast momentum grabber, Rotom-C appreciates VoltTurn partners such as Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Infernape. All of these can also break down the special walls that Rotom-C has trouble beating. Special wallbreakers such as Life Orb Hydreigon and Choice Specs Kyurem make for good teammates to make way for Rotom-C to clean up late-game.</p>"

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being commonly overlooked in the UU metagame, Uxie makes for a solid Stealth Rock user and pivot for more balance or bulky offense inclined teams. Incredible defenses at base 130 a piece give Uxie great natural bulk despite its rather mediocre HP stat. With the Levitate ability at its disposal, this bulky Psychic-type also provides an extra Ground-type immunity for the user's team as well as an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. To complement its bulk, Uxie has access to a wide variety of support moves including Thunder Wave, U-turn, and Memento in addition to the previously mentioned Stealth Rock. Uxie also possesses a great Speed stat for a more defensive Pokemon at base 95, allowing it to outpace most of the other bulky Pokemon in the tier.</p> <p>However, Uxie has some glaring weaknesses including relatively low offensive stats making it more passive than it would prefer. Also, to counteract its great natural bulk and support movepool, mono-Psychic typing is a rather mediocre one defensively, leaving Uxie vulnerable to common moves such as Knock Off and Pursuit. This couples with the fact that Uxie has no means of reliable recovery. It is also worth noting that aside from setting up Stealth Rock and gaining momentum with U-turn, Cresselia largely outclasses Uxie in essentially every other role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>In addition to Stealth Rock, U-turn, Yawn, and Thunder Wave, Uxie has access to many other unique utility moves, but they are usually not as reliable or helpful. Dual screens can be used along with Light Clay, to aid setup sweepers, but Cresselia is generally preferred due to its superior bulk and recovery. Toxic is an option over Thunder Wave to wear down opposing Pokemon, notably Sableye as it often switches in, but Uxie has no reliable recovery to help rack up damage, and Steel-types are also common switch-ins. Memento is a solid option, especially when used along with dual screens, to aid sweepers in the back that otherwise have a hard time setting up safely. Colbur Berry could be used over Leftovers, but Uxie does not have many great options to threaten Dark-types back and Uxie also appreciates the passive recovery from Leftovers. Mental Herb is an option to avoid opposing Taunts and Encores that is better utilized if you're using Memento. Knock Off is an option as an attacking move to cripple opposing walls, but it is generally hard for it to find a moveslot with so many other options. Finally, Uxie makes for a useful weather setter for rain and sun teams, since it can combine weather-setting duties and Stealth Rock in one team slot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Krookodile, Crawdaunt, Hydreigon, and Sharpedo are all immune to Uxie's only STAB move and threaten it out, as they can all deal heavy damage. Some have to be wary of being paralyzed on the switch, though.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Fast Taunt users such as Froslass, Sableye, and Hydreigon can prevent Uxie from supporting the rest of the team with Thunder Wave and Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Poison and burn severely hamper Uxie's defensive capabilities and longevity.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Escavalier, Doublade, and Forretress do not fear Uxie and can proceed to successfully do their jobs in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Suicune, Snorlax, and Reuniclus all easily set up on Uxie, as it cannot threaten them in any way.</p>",

It notably can break the Substitute of offensive Gyarados with no extra Special Attack investment and potentially 2HKO Assault Vest Conkeldurr after Stealth Rock damage. However, Psychic is a good option as well if the user's team already has solid answers to Gyarados, as it hits Cobalion, Chesnaught, and a boosted Bulk Up Conkeldurr for significantly more damage. U-turn allows Uxie to act as a solid pivot and keep up offensive momentum, allowing the user to bring in their threats safely. Stealth Rock is crucial for every competitive team, as it helps punish opposing switches and supports the other members of the team as they put on pressure. These two moves set this Pokemon apart from other bulky Psychic-types in the tier. Thunder Wave allows Uxie to essentially neuter opposing fast threats or setup sweepers such as Mega Aerodactyl, Hydreigon, or Cobalion. Yawn, with its tendency to force switches, can be used in conjunction with U-turn as a great way to grab momentum and net a free switchin for frail attackers or setup sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EVs placed in HP and Defense along with a Bold nature let Uxie take on the many physical attackers of the tier better, more specifically common Fighting-types such as Machamp, Lucario, Toxicroak, and Cobalion. Leftovers provides passive recovery, the only solid recovery to which Uxie has access. The ability Levitate offers an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which is crucial for pivots, as they can switch in much more easily, and also provides an extra Ground-type immunity for the user's team. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 SpD with a Calm nature is a viable option, as it let's Uxie take on special attackers such as Mega Sceptile, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Uxie can be used early-game to set up Stealth Rock early in order to rack up damage on the opposing team as they continuously switch in. Uxie switches in well against many common physical attackers. Afterwards, the user can set up Stealth Rock, attempt to cripple foes with Thunder Wave or Yawn, and keep up momentum using U-turn. Uxie puts in work as a pivot in the early- and mid-game, allowing sweepers in the back to take advantage of paralysis spread around and Stealth Rock damage inflicted upon the opposing team. Knock Off and Dark-type moves in general are fairly common, so be wary of opposing Dark-type Pokemon switching in and threatening Uxie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cobalion and Chesnaught make for quality partners, as they can sponge common Dark-type moves while fulfilling their respective roles. Florges checks many Dark-types, specifically Hydreigon, and Bug-types while also being able to heal any status ailment that may be inflicted upon Uxie. Pokemon that can combat opposing bulky Steel-types such as Entei and Krookodile pair well. Finally, Uxie works well with hard-hitting Pokemon that appreciate the Speed drops of Thunder Wave and the fact that U-turn can bring them in safely; Crawdaunt and Sylveon are prime examples.</p>"

  "Shaymin": {
    "overview": "<p>Shaymin is one of the most threatening specially offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its signature STAB attack Seed Flare sports a solid 40% chance to halve Special Defense, allowing it to potentially break through would-be checks and counters. Shaymin also has solid stats across the board, with good bulk and access to an important Speed tier at base 100. Its useful resistances to Ground- and Water-type attacks give it plenty of opportunities to switch in against the numerous bulky Pokemon in the tier. However, Seed Flare's low PP and accuracy can be its downfall, and when it doesn't get lucky with Special Defense drops, Shaymin's average base 100 Special Attack does not do it any favors.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set with Healing Wish can be used, especially because Shaymin is faster than Hydreigon, but without a boosting item Shaymin isn't very strong and Seed Flare should not be used as a revenge killing tool due to its bad accuracy. A physical set consisting of Swords Dance / Seed Bomb / Return / Synthesis with Life Orb can be used to surprise Shaymin's traditional counters, as Blissey and Goodra are 2HKOed by +2 Return, but it is very matchup-reliant and overall not as reliable as Shaymin's other sets. Shaymin has access to Tailwind, which it could run on a set as an alternative to Healing Wish. Hidden Power Fire can be a useful coverage option should you want a lure for Forretress and Escavalier. A defensive Aromatherapy set is an interesting option to support the team, but lack of other supporting options makes it a lesser choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dedicated Special Walls</strong>: Blissey isn't fazed by any of Shaymin's attacking moves unless Shaymin gets two Special Defense drops, at which point it has a chance to be 2HKOed. However, it has to be wary of the Leech Seed set, which can stall it out, and must be played with caution around the Choice Specs set. Goodra is a special case, as its ability Sap Sipper makes it immune to Seed Flare and Leech Seed and due to its great special bulk it takes a pittance from Shaymin's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Specially defensive Roserade and Mega Abomasnow take little damage from any of Shaymin's moves besides Psychic and Air Slash. Also, both Roserade and Mega Abomasnow threaten it directly with STAB Sludge Bomb and Blizzard, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Specially defensive Forretress and Bronzong are either only 4HKOed by or immune to Earth Power, Shaymin's only coverage on Steel-types besides the rare Hidden Power Fire, but have no recovery of their own and can only threaten back Synthesis Shaymin with the combination of Gyro Ball and Toxic, or simply by setting up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Faster Flying-types such as Crobat and Tornadus make for good checks to Shaymin, as they can Roost off damage or force Shaymin out with their powerful STAB moves. However, Crobat cannot switch into Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Most Fire-types either faster than Shaymin or unaffected by Earth Power, such as Infernape, Rotom-H, Choice Scarf Chandelure, and Choice Scarf Darmanitan, can switch into Shaymin with caution or simply revenge kill it, but they will be worn down quickly by Stealth Rock.</p>",

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shaymin's signature attack Seed Flare is a powerful STAB move that can allow Shaymin to break past would-be switch-ins such as Florges and Umbreon with a little luck thanks to its amazing side effect. Earth Power provides useful coverage on many types that resist Seed Flare, especially Fire-types such as Entei. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam can be used to surprise and OHKO Hydreigon and Noivern, but it leaves Shaymin very susceptible to bulky Steel-types. While Air Slash hits all Grass-types super effectively, it has very low Base Power, which makes Psychic the preferred option most of the times, as it provides coverage on Crobat as well as Roserade and Chesnaught. Synthesis heals Shaymin for 50% of its HP at will, although the low PP can be an issue. Rest may seem like a better option, as it heals Shaymin fully and pairs nicely with Natural Cure, but it relinquishes momentum, forcing Shaymin to hard switch out. Healing Wish can be hard to fit on a set but provides fantastic utility, fully recovering another Pokemon once Shaymin has done its job.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed spread gives Shaymin as much Speed and power as possible. A Timid nature is needed to Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon and outspeed the likes of Darmanitan and Entei. Life Orb is required to help Shaymin wallbreak, as it is rather weak without a boosting item, and the recoil can be offset thanks to its reliable recovery anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The many bulky Water- and Ground-types that populate the tier, such as Suicune and Mamoswine, respectively, give Shaymin plenty of opportunities to switch in and attack. Seed Flare's low PP and chance to miss can make it an easy move to exploit, so try not to spam it recklessly. However, be aware that going for the 40% chance of a Special Defense drop is often the best way to snowball past would-be checks such as Florges.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciates the removal of bulky Water- and Ground-types makes for a good offensive partner to Shaymin; in particular, Darmanitan can bring in Shaymin safely with U-turn, and Krookodile can Pursuit trap problematic Pokemon such as Bronzong and to an extent Crobat. Life Orb Shaymin struggles to get past extremely specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey, so it should be partnered with Pokemon that can either lure and beat them, such as Life Orb mixed Infernape and Hydreigon, or set up on them, such as Cresselia. In addition, Life Orb Shaymin makes really good use of entry hazard support, as it can force a lot of switches with its great coverage and Seed Flare's secondary effect. Stealth Rock in particular hurts most of Shaymin's offensive checks, and Shaymin pairs well with the setters in the tier, most of which appreciate the removal of bulky Water-types in return. Also, as Shaymin dislikes bulky Steel-types, Pokemon such as Entei and Chandelure are useful for removing them.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shaymin's main STAB attack, Seed Flare, becomes very scary with the power of Choice Specs backing it up, and decently bulky Pokemon that resist Grass such as Hydreigon and Rotom-H fall into 2HKO range (even Hydreigon gets 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage). Earth Power hits most Pokemon that resist Grass-type attacks super effectively, but it is a much more risky move when Shaymin is locked into it, as it can give away easy setup opportunities. Dazzling Gleam hits Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Noivern super effectively. Air Slash hits Grass-types super effectively, but Psychic OHKOes Crobat with Stealth Rock on the field, as well as hitting both Roserade and Chesnaught hard, making it the superior option. Healing Wish is a fantastic support move that Shaymin actually has room for on a Choiced set, giving it the opportunity to fully heal another Pokemon once it has done its job. While Healing Wish is one of the main selling points of this set, Energy Ball is a safe, reliable STAB move with no PP issue that Shaymin can make good use of as well, should your team not require Healing Wish support.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed spread gives Shaymin as much Speed and power as possible. Although it might be tempting to run a Modest nature on a Choice Specs set, Shaymin outspeeding Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Darmanitan is usually more important than the increase in damage output that still doesn't allow it to threaten the likes of Blissey. Choice Specs Shaymin packs a hefty punch but is essentially locked out of its great coverage options, exacerbating Seed Flare's PP issue.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because of its lack of a recovery move, Choice Specs Shaymin can be worn down very quickly by Scald burns or simply switching into resisted moves. As a result, prediction is key when using this set, especially if entry hazards are on your side of the field, as Shaymin only gets so many chances to come in and wallbreak. Shaymin's coverage moves, while useful, are also rather weak and easy to take advantage of, so they should be used with caution. Don't hesitate to make full use of Healing Wish, as Shaymin's decent bulk will only carry it so far anyway without recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Shaymin is best used on very offensive teams, which appreciate its high damage output and can put to good use the utility of Healing Wish and in return usually provide the entry hazards Shaymin requires to OHKO some Pokemon such as Crobat or Entei. Threatening setup sweepers that synergize well with Shaymin such as Haxorus and Calm Mind variants of Suicune can do their own wallbreaking with Healing Wish support. Because Choice items lock the user into a move, having a decent switch-in to common Shaymin answers such as Crobat is required should you predict wrong. Pokemon that can handle bulky Steel-types, such as Entei and Darmanitan, are helpful too.</p>"
      },
      "Leech Seed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leech Seed allows Shaymin to wear down special walls such as Blissey and Florges while also keeping it healthy. Seed Flare is Shaymin's most powerful STAB move and is very threatening once Shaymin is behind a Substitute, although it should be noted that the drop in power due to Leftovers is very noticeable. The choice between Air Slash and Psychic is complicated by the fact that while Air Slash provides insurance against the Grass-types that are unaffected by Leech Seed, Crobat is an even more important target because it can hit through Substitutes. However, some Grass-types, namely Roserade and Chesnaught, are hit super effectively by Psychic as well. Substitute can be used to ease predictions and protect Shaymin from status while allowing Shaymin to stall out Pokemon with Leech Seed. Protect is a decent alternative that doesn't cut Shaymin's health. It should be noted that Earth Power can also be used as the coverage move of choice, as it is much more suited to deal with the offensive checks to this set, namely Fire-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is used to let Shaymin get enough residual healing alongside Leech Seed to be able to continuously make Substitutes as well as have more longevity in general. The use of an offensive spread is required to keep the benefits of Shaymin's important Speed tier as well as to make up for its average base 100 Special Attack. Going for a more bulky spread is possible but not recommended, as Shaymin then lacks any offensive presence against offensive teams; moreover, 101 HP Substitutes are unneeded when the only common user of Seismic Toss in the tier is Blissey.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Leech Seed as often as possible is key for this set, as keeping Shaymin healthy is a priority and it will wear down the opponent's team . Once it has Leech Seed a Pokemon, Shaymin can repeatedly use Substitute to wear it down without losing any health or wear it down more quickly with Seed Flare. Against more offensive teams, using Substitute while forcing out a Pokemon can make Shaymin extremely hard to deal with as long as it can get a little luck when using Seed Flare.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This particular Shaymin set forces a lot of switches and as a result works best with entry hazard support. Many Stealth Rock setters such as Krookodile, Gligar, and Mega Aerodactyl benefit in return from the removal of bulky Water-types. A special mention is given to Toxic Spikes, as they add to the residual damage of Leech Seed. In particular, Nidoqueen has decent synergy with Shaymin and thrives when special walls are worn down.</p>"

  "Emboar": {
    "overview": "<p>Emboar has gained a great ability in Reckless, which increases its wallbreaking capabilities by boosting the power of its recoil attacks. These wallbreaking capabilities are supported by Emboar's very good base 123 Attack stat, which makes it an excellent choice for offensively based teams. Furthermore, Emboar has quite a wide movepool with a variety of coverage options to benefit from. Emboar also has a solid HP stat that helps it switch in against foes and take their attacks better, but most importantly, it lets Emboar take recoil from its attacking moves better. An immunity to Will-O-Wisp is excellent for a physical attacker like Emboar, as it means Emboar cannot be hampered by burn. Emboar also has a good offensive typing as well as a decent defensive typing, with several useful resistances but also a lot of weaknesses. Additionally, Emboar's high HP stat is let down by its mediocre Defense and Special Defense stats, and it is also easily worn down by the recoil damage induced by Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and Head Smash. Emboar also has a low Speed stat, which leaves it outsped by a lot of common threats in the current metagame. Lastly, Emboar faces competition from Darmanitan as a wallbreaker because of the latter's access to U-turn and Sheer Force, but Emboar's niche lies in Reckless, its typing, and priority in Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set with Will-O-Wisp, Low Kick, Flare Blitz, and Roar can be used, but Emboar is a bit frail and can be easily KOed. The combination of Substitute + Focus Punch can be used, but Emboar is too slow to set up a Substitute and Superpower is generally better. A fully special set is an option to use to surprise opponents, but Emboar lacks the moves to fully take advantage of this and it puts Reckless to waste.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: The recoil induced by moves such as Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and Head Smash will eventually bring Emboar to its end. Life Orb Emboar takes even more recoil damage. Pokemon with a Rocky Helmet will also contribute to wearing Emboar down, as most of its damaging moves make contact.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon with Super Effective Coverage Moves</strong>: Pokemon such as Krookodile and Mienshao can outspeed Emboar and beat it with their super effective attacks. They should watch out for Choice Scarf Emboar, however.</p> <p><strong>Very Bulky Physical Walls</strong>: Very bulky physical walls such as Alomomola and Mega Blastoise can usually take Emboar's physical attacks, but they should be wary of Grass Knot.</p>",

      "Footloose": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a STAB attack which becomes extremely powerful after boosts from STAB, Life Orb, and Reckless. Superpower is a secondary STAB attack with great power and coverage but lowers Emboar's Attack and Defense stats after each use. Grass Knot gets the primary slash in the third slot, as it lets Emboar KO Mega Swampert, which would normally wall it. Wild Charge is an option in the third slot that allows Emboar to hit Water-types such as Suicune harder and is boosted by Reckless. Head Smash is also an option in the third slot for superior power and coverage over Wild Charge, but it is less accurate and inflicts more recoil. Its main targets are Arcanine and Chandelure. Sucker Punch is used for hitting Psychic-types that threaten Emboar, as well as picking off weakened Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Reckless boosts the power of Flare Blitz and other recoil-inducing attacks Emboar uses by 20%. Life Orb gives an additional boost to all of Emboar's moves, turning it into a dangerous physical wallbreaker. The given spread lets Emboar outspeed up to uninvested base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Suicune, Gligar, defensive Roserade, and defensive Rotom-H. The Attack EVs ensure Emboar hits as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack for a higher chance to OHKO Swampert after Stealth Rock. Either a Naughty or Adamant nature should be used, depending on whether Grass Knot is used or not. If so, a Naughty nature should be used; if not, use Adamant. If Grass Knot is not used, the 32 Special Attack EVs should be shifted into HP with the remaining 4 going into Special Defense to prevent Download Porygon-Z from getting a Special Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Emboar can switch into a handful of physical walls, such as Porygon2, in order to attack them and pressure them by dealing a lot of damage. Superpower should be used sparingly, as after each use, Emboar's Attack and Defense stats are lowered, and thus its damage output will be lessened. Emboar's safest option is Flare Blitz if you're not sure of your opponent's play, as it hits switch-ins hard, even those that resist it. Switch Emboar out of faster Pokemon with a type advantage, such as Crobat, as they can inflict a ton of damage on Emboar with a super effective move. Emboar can switch in on certain Pokemon it has a type advantage against, such as Umbreon and Forretress, force them out, and then hit whatever switches in hard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress and Froslass is appreciated, as it eases wallbreaking for Emboar. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Forretress and Mega Blastoise is good for Emboar, as entry hazards wear down Emboar quickly. Setup sweepers such as Haxorus and Lucario appreciate Emboar's wallbreaking capabilities and thus make for good partners. Wish support Umbreon and Florges is also very useful because of Emboar's limited longevity due to recoil from its attacks. Grass-types such as Chesnaught and Shaymin are nice choices because they can switch into Ground-type attacks from faster Pokemon. Pokemon such as Rotom-H and Mega Aerodactyl can take care of faster Flying-types and therefore make excellent teammates as well. Slow momentum gainers, such as Gligar, Rotom-H, and Forretress, grant Emboar a safe switch in against its foe.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a very powerful STAB attack boosted by Reckless and hits almost any Pokemon hard on the switch in, including those that resist it. Superpower is a powerful secondary STAB attack and has good neutral coverage with Flare Blitz, but it does lower Attack and Defense after use. Wild Charge hits the Water-types resistant to Flare Blitz and is boosted by Reckless as well. Head Smash hits opposing Fire-types, such as Chandelure, has excellent overall coverage, and gets a 20% boost from Reckless. Earthquake is another attacking option for decent power and coverage and forms almost perfect neutral coverage with Wild Charge. Sleep Talk can be considered in order to absorb sleep-inducing moves such as Roserade's Sleep Powder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Reckless gives a boost to recoil-inducing attacks. Choice Scarf turns Emboar into a dangerous revenge killer and allows it outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame. The EV spread lets Emboar hit as hard as possible, and the investment in Speed makes Emboar a lot faster, letting it outspeed even more Pokemon. A Jolly nature is recommended, as without it, Emboar will fail to outspeed Espeon and Tornadus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Emboar is a fine late-game cleaner once physical walls have been beaten, so try to beat them first before sending Emboar in. This set also makes Emboar a decent revenge killer, so sending it in after a teammate has fainted is a decent choice too. Use Superpower sparingly, as it lowers Emboar's Attack and Defense after use. Definitely watch out for moves that remove items because if Emboar gets hit by one, it will be easily revenge killed by foes because of its low Speed stat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Dragalge are generally good partners for their ability to beat physical walls, which this set fails to do. Wish support from Pokemon such as Florges, Umbreon, and Alomomola is good for letting Emboar stay healthy after recoil damage. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress and Roserade is appreciated in order to KO foes with more ease. Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Forretress can remove hazards for Emboar and are excellent choices in order to help it avoid this passive damage. Pokemon such as Suicune, which can handle faster Pokemon such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, make for good partners, as do Mega Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Mega Sceptile, which do not mind taking a Knock Off. A cleric that can remove paralysis, such as Umbreon, is very good for Emboar, because paralysis leaves it outsped by a lot of Pokemon.</p>"

However, it should be noted that Seismitoad's stats, both offensively and defensively, are outclassed by Swampert's. If you're using Seismitoad, be sure to use it alongside Pokemon that appreciate its unique traits. Otherwise, you are usually better off sticking with Swampert.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seismitoad can utilize a Swift Swim and Rain Dance set to attempt a sweep, but this is usually better left to Mega Swampert, which outclasses it in pretty much every way.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock provides entry hazard support that every team appreciates, and Seismitoad is a very reliable user of the move due to its good defenses and typing. Earthquake is a powerful STAB move that hits hard off of base 95 Attack even without investment, allowing Seismitoad to effectively counter the various Steel- and Poison-types in UU. Scald is an alternative STAB move that has a 30% chance to burn, helping to cripple physical attackers and whittle down the foe. Knock Off cripples threatening switch-ins and is another trait that sets Seismitoad apart from Swampert. Toxic is an alternative over Knock Off to spread status around and goes well with Seismitoad's ability to tank moves. Protect is another option to garner a free turn of Leftovers recovery, which Seismitoad will appreciate due to its lack of a form of reliable recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>200 HP EVs maximize Seismitoad's overall bulk and allow it to evenly restore HP with Leftovers. Maximum investment in Defense is needed so that Seismitoad can tank repeated hits from powerful sweepers such as Mega Aerodactyl, Darmanitan, and Feraligatr. A Relaxed nature boosts Seismitoad's Defense and lowers its unimportant Speed while preserving the power of its STAB moves. Leftovers increases Seismitoad's longevity and is important, as it lacks a form of reliable recovery. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to round out Seismitoad's overall bulk. Seismitoad can also run a specially defensive spread of 200 HP / 56 Def / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature to better check Pokemon such as Mega Ampharos, offensive Suicune, and Chandelure.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aim to use Seismitoad's impressive bulk, resistances, and Water-type immunity in order to switch in and set up Stealth Rock to support your team. Seismitoad's excellent defensive typing makes it a great check to a lot of common offensive threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Feraligatr, Cobalion, Darmanitan, Entei, and Tyrantrum. Water Absorb makes it immune to the ever-present Scald and allows it to take advantage of Pokemon such as Vaporeon, defensive Empoleon, Tentacruel, and Alomomola. Be sure to utilize Water Absorb and Knock Off, as they are unique traits that give Seismitoad an advantage over its Water / Ground type counterpart, Swampert.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seismitoad excels on balanced and defensive teams. Due to its inclination towards tanking physical hits and lack of reliable recovery, it partners extremely well with specially defensive Wish users such as Florges, Umbreon, and Blissey. Wish helps keep Seismitoad healthy and increases its walling potential. Powerful sweepers that benefit from entry hazard support, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Heracross, make for great teammates. Pokemon that synergize well defensively with Seismitoad, especially Grass-types such as Shaymin, Roserade, and Chesnaught, make for great partners. Roserade and Chesnaught can also set up Spikes to complement the Stealth Rock support Seismitoad provides. Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types such as Darmanitan, Mega Aerodactyl, and Nidoqueen enjoy Seismitoad's ability to absorb Water-type attacks directed at them.</p>"

It also has a decent movepool, both offensively and defensively, and it has a very good offensive typing that hits a variety of foes hard. Krookodile has access to useful abilities in Intimidate and Moxie that allow it to play different roles in the metagame successfully, such as that of a Choice Band attacker. However, Krookodile has quite a lot of weaknesses to several common types, such as Fighting and Water, and even though its Speed is decent, it is outsped by a lot of threats in the metagame, meaning that they can easily KO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive set with Intimidate and a spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with an Impish nature is an option, but it's generally not worth running as it's mostly outclassed by Pokemon such as Gligar, which has better Defense and access to reliable recovery. Bulk Up and Hone Claws are options to set up with, but running one of these moves means that Krookodile misses out on a coverage move, which it cannot afford to do. Iron Tail is an option to hit Fairy-types such as Florges and Whimsicott, but it doesn't have reliable accuracy and most Fairy-types are hit hard by Earthquake or don't like having their item removed anyway. Aerial Ace hits Grass-types such as Mega Sceptile, Chesnaught, and Virizion hard, but it has low Base Power and poor coverage otherwise. Aqua Tail hits Rhyperior for more damage than Krookodile's other attacks, but the move has limited coverage otherwise. Fire Fang has good coverage and a chance to burn and flinch opposing Pokemon, but it has low Base Power and doesn't have any relevant targets aside from Forretress. Lastly, Dragon Tail can be used to force out a foe if they try to set up and makes the Pokemon that was dragged in take entry hazard damage, but most foes aren't able to set up after Taunt anyway, and it has low Base Power and bad coverage too.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hydreigon</strong>: Hydreigon resists Krookodile's STAB combination and can KO it with a Draco Meteor. However, it has to be wary of Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Sceptile, Chesnaught, and Shaymin resist Earthquake and can take any hit from Krookodile.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Florges, Whimsicott, and Sylveon resist Knock Off, are only 3HKOed by Earthquake, and can stall Krookodile out or beat it with a STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Suicune, Chesnaught, and Gligar can all take Krookodile's hits well and stall it out or hit it hard, but they dislike taking a Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Machamp, and Infernape can take a hit from Krookodile and knock it out with a STAB attack, though Infernape needs to be wary of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster attackers such as Celebi and Mienshao can take out Krookodile with one of their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Burn is threatening for Krookodile, as it halves its Attack, meaning it will miss out on many important KOs.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a solid STAB attack that has excellent coverage and great Base Power, meaning it hits almost everything that doesn't resist it hard. Knock Off is another a good STAB attack that also has the utility of removing the foe's item. Stone Edge is a powerful move that not only hits the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake but also has great coverage against other types, such as Bug. Pursuit traps Pokemon such as Chandelure and Hoopa and deals more damage to them if they try to switch out. Superpower can be used over Stone Edge or Pursuit for good coverage alongside Earthquake that hurts Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate is used to boost Krookodile's staying power as it lowers the foe's Attack stat, and thus its damage output. Choice Band is used because it gives a huge boost to Krookodile's Attack. The investment in Attack and Speed ensures that Krookodile hits very hard and allows it to to outspeed Pokemon such as Lucario. The 4 Defense EVs are invested to give a small boost to Krookodile's Defense, while also letting it hit an odd HP number, which lessens Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature should be used alongside Choice Band to boost Krookodile's Speed because it already has enough power, and otherwise it misses out on outspeeding Pokemon such as Nidoking and the aforementioned Lucario.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Krookodile is a good revenge killer as well as a good switch-in against most Ghost- and Psychic-types, as it can trap and beat them with Pursuit. Krookodile can also switch into Electric-type attackers such Mega Ampharos and Rotom-H, as it is immune to their STAB attacks and can OHKO the former with Earthquake and threaten the latter with Knock Off or Stone Edge. Don't recklessly use Earthquake, though; if the opponent has a Flying-type or a Levitate user, it can come in without problems and forces Krookodile to switch while it uses the free turn to set up. Use Pursuit if you predict that the opponent will switch out a foe that is weak to Dark-type attacks, as it will get boosted power and most likely OHKO the foe. This Krookodile functions as a wallbreaker, so you can send it in to weaken a selection of physical walls, such as Suicune.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cleric support from Pokemon such as Sylveon or Florges is really appreciated, as these Pokemon have good synergy with Krookodile and burn will leave Krookodile quite weak. Pokemon that can take care of Fighting-types such as Celebi, Crobat, and Mega Aerodactyl make for great teammates, as Fighting-types really threaten Krookodile. Pokemon that can reliably beat Grass-types, such as Arcanine and Mega Beedrill, are fine partners as well. Steel-types such as Bronzong and Mega Aggron make for good partners, as they can beat the Fairy-types that hinder Krookodile. Pokemon that can pass through physically defensive walls such as Suicune and Forretress are great partners, as they prevent Krookodile from sweeping. Examples of these Pokemon include Mega Sceptile and Hydreigon.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a powerful STAB move that cripples most switch-ins by removing their items. Earthquake has great Base Power and good coverage, meaning that it hits a variety of Pokemon very hard. Taunt can be used in the third slot to prevent foes from setting up entry hazards or boosting their stats. Pursuit is an option in the last slot to trap and beat opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types. Superpower can go in the last slot as well because of its great coverage, but it lowers Krookodile's Attack and Defense. Stealth Rock hurts foes on the switch-in and helps Krookodile to KO the foe with greater ease, so it can be used in the third or the fourth slot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate lessens the damage output of the foe's physical attacks, meaning Krookodile has better staying power against Pokemon such as Crobat and Lucario. Dread Plate or Earth Plate can be used depending on if you want to give a power boost to Earthquake or to Knock Off, but Life Orb is a good option for more overall power. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet can be used to inflict a little extra chip damage against certain physical attackers such as Crobat. The EVs maximize Krookodile's offensive capabilities, as they boost its Attack and Speed stats. 4 Defense EVs are invested to give a small boost to Krookodile's Defense, but they also let it hit an odd HP number, which lessens damage taken from Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature allows Krookodile to outspeed maximum Speed base 90s such as Lucario. A spread of 96 HP / 252 Atk / 160 Spe is another option that still outspeeds Adamant Lucario and Timid Chandelure and helps Krookodile stand up to physical attackers better. Alternatively, another spread of 252 HP / 96 Atk / 160 Spe still outspeeds Adamant Lucario and Timid Chandelure, but gives a bigger boost to Krookodile's bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Knock Off when you are unsure of what to do, as most Pokemon don't appreciate having their item removed. When you predict that a foe weak to Dark will switch out, which will most likely happen, use Pursuit to trap and KO it. Switch out of physical walls, as most of them can either inflict status on and cripple Krookodile or just completely outstall it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Galvantula and Blissey provide Sticky Web or Thunder Wave support, respectively, which is useful because with this support, Krookodile will be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Mienshao and beat them before they can hit Krookodile. Special wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Chandelure make for good partners, as they can beat the physical walls that hinder Krookodile from sweeping. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Florges or Vaporeon is very useful, as status such as burn really cripples Krookodile. Fire-types, such as Entei, which beat the Grass-types that resist Krookodile's main STAB move are great teammates as well. Flying-types such as Gyarados and Crobat are great partners, as they are capable of outspeeding and beating most Fighting-types. Magneton and Nidoqueen are examples of Pokemon that can beat Fairy-types, which Krookodile struggles against. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Metagross or the aforementioned Blissey is useful too, as it helps Krookodile KO its foes more often. Lastly, Fighting-type Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Lucario are good teammates, as they can take advantage of Krookodile trapping Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon with Pursuit.</p>"

Knock Off is a good STAB attack that also removes the item of the foe. Stone Edge is a powerful move that hits the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake and also has great coverage against other Pokemon, such as Bug-types. Crunch can be used for permanent power in the third slot instead and has the added niche of hitting Mega Pokemon harder than Knock Off does. Pursuit traps Pokemon such as Chandelure and Espeon and deals more damage to them if they try to switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Moxie boosts Krookodile's Attack stat after it knocks out a Pokemon with an attack, and it is the best option on an offensive set like this. Choice Scarf is used as it gives a huge boost to Krookodile's Speed. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs let Krookodile hit very hard and allow it to to outspeed Pokemon such as maximum Speed Lucario. 4 Defense EVs are invested to give a little boost to Krookodile's Defense stat, while letting Krookodile hit an odd HP number which lessens the damage taken from Stealth Rock. A Jolly nature should be used on this set because it allows Krookodile to outspeed maximum Speed Mega Aerodactyl, which it wouldn't be able to do otherwise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Krookodile can be sent in to revenge kill a foe after one of Krookodile's teammates has been beaten. Aside from that, Krookodile can also be switched into most Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon, as it can trap and beat them with a Pursuit afterwards. Krookodile can switch into Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Rotom-C and Heliolisk, as it is immune to them. Don't recklessly spam Earthquake if the opponent has a Flying-type or a Levitate user, as it can come in, force a switch, and set up that turn. Use Pursuit if you predict the opponent to switch out a Pokemon weak to Dark-type attacks, as its power will be boosted and it will most likely OHKO that Pokemon. Lastly, this Krookodile can be used as a late-game cleaner once physical walls are gone, so try to remove those first.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cleric support from Pokemon such as Blissey or Umbreon is nice, as burns leave Krookodile weak and unable to function well. Pokemon that can get rid of threatening Fighting-types, such as Florges, Espeon, and Mega Aerodactyl, make for good partners too. Additionally, Pokemon that reliably beat Grass-types, such as Arcanine and Mega Beedrill, are fine partners as well, because Grass-types resist Krookodile's main STAB attack and can KO it with their STAB attacks. Steel-types such as Lucario and Mega Aggron are also good teammates because they can beat the Fairy-types that hinder Krookodile. Finally, Pokemon such as Mega Sceptile and Hydreigon, which can break through physically defensive walls such as Suicune and Forretress, are great partners for Krookodile, as walls prevent Krookodile from sweeping.</p>"

  "Darmanitan": {
    "overview": "<p>Darmanitan is almost the definition of a hard-hitting Fire-type, sporting an impressive base 140 Attack alongside a Sheer Force-boosted STAB Flare Blitz. To augment its sheer power, it has a solid base 95 Speed, putting it above many Pokemon in UU. Its ability Sheer Force is also useful, boosting the power of not only Flare Blitz, but also useful coverage moves such as Rock Slide. Darmanitan also has some great options for coverage, including Superpower and Earthquake. Sadly, Darmanitan has subpar bulk and no access to recovery moves. As if that weren't enough, its best STAB move, Flare Blitz, further limits its bulk due to its heavy recoil effect.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Punch is an option over Flare Blitz to avoid taking recoil damage, but it is much weaker than Flare Blitz and takes away much of Darmanitan's wallbreaking power. Zen Headbutt is an option to hit Fighting- and Poison-types hard without taking recoil damage, but it actually deals less damage than a STAB Flare Blitz and has redundant coverage. It is, however, boosted by Sheer Force. A Belly Drum set with Substitute and Salac Berry can be used to try to sweep, but it requires far too much support to be used effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Walls</strong>: Some defensively oriented Pokemon such as Suicune, Rhyperior, and Swampert avoid 2HKOs from any of Darmanitan's moves and can KO it. Vaporeon can also tank a Flare Blitz and KO back, although it does not want to switch into a Choice Band Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Physically defensive Arcanine can capably switch into any of Darmanitan's moves and heal off the damage with Morning Sun, although it must be wary of switching into a Rock Slide or Earthquake, especially when Stealth Rock has been set up.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock will wear down Darmanitan significantly, as it takes around 25% every time it switches into them. Spikes also wear Darmanitan down quickly, as it is grounded.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster attackers, as well as strong priority move users, can limit Darmanitan's wallbreaking and sweeping capabilities. Those include Hydreigon, Mega Aerodactyl, Mienshao, and Entei.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Darmanitan's most powerful STAB move, hitting most Pokemon in the tier for heavy damage, especially when boosted by Sheer Force. Rock Slide is a valuable coverage move that is also boosted by Sheer Force, primarily hitting other Fire-types and Mega Aerodactyl. U-turn is useful for gaining momentum, giving a free switch for whatever Pokemon the opponent sends in. Earthquake is recommended in the last slot for hitting Poison-, Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-types super effectively, but Superpower can be used, as it hits Normal- and Dark-types super effectively while retaining coverage against Rhyperior, but it misses out on coverage against Poison- and Electric-types such as Nidoqueen and Mega Ampharos, respectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Attack and Speed EVs maximize Darmanitan's cleaning and revenge killing capabilities. The remaining 4 EVs are invested in Special Defense to give Porygon-Z and Porygon2 an Attack boost from Download instead of a Special Attack boost. Sheer Force increases the power of Darmanitan's moves that have secondary effects, including Flare Blitz and Rock Slide. Choice Scarf is used alongside a Jolly nature in order to outspeed threats such as Mega Beedrill, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Darmanitan is best used as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner. In the early-game, Darmanitan should be spamming U-turn to wear down its counters and gain momentum to clean more easily in the late-game. You should try to avoid locking Darmanitan into Flare Blitz if the opponent has a Choice Scarf Hydreigon, as it will be able to come in and retaliate with a powerful STAB Draco Meteor. Also, try to avoid using Flare Blitz too much, as the recoil will quickly wear Darmanitan down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A spinner or Defogger makes for a good partner for Darmanitan, as it is weak to Stealth Rock, which will quickly wear it down in conjunction with Flare Blitz recoil. Tentacruel and Mega Blastoise make for good partners, as Darmanitan can beat Grass-types for them and Mega Blastoise and Tentacruel can take on Fire-types; Blastoise can also beat Ground-types, which makes Darmanitan's job easier. Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Forretress can provide Stealth Rock support to help Darmanitan clean in the late-game more easily. Pokemon that can take on Rhyperior and bulky Water-types make for good teammates, as they otherwise wall Darmanitan. Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade make for good teammates in this right, and they can absorb status thanks to Natural Cure. Roserade can provide entry hazard support in the form of Toxic Spikes and Spikes. Finally, Pokemon that can handle faster Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Mienshao are appreciated. Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Florges can handle them well.</p>"

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Darmanitan's most powerful STAB move that is further boosted by Sheer Force. Rock Slide gets excellent coverage alongside Flare Blitz, notably hitting other Fire-types super effectively, and it receives the boost from Sheer Force. U-turn is used to give a free switch to a teammate if the foe switches out, therefore gaining momentum, or to switch out of a foe Darmanitan can't beat. Earthquake is useful to hit Rhyperior and Steel-, Fire-, Poison-, and Electric-types, especially Mega Ampharos, super effectively. Superpower, however, can be used, as it also hits Rhyperior and Steel-types, as well as Normal- and Dark-types such as Snorlax and Umbreon, respectively. Though it has higher Base Power, remember that Superpower also lowers Darmanitan's Attack and Defense.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature maximize Darmanitan's wallbreaking power and Speed. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to force an Attack boost on Porygon-Z and Porygon2 instead of a more threatening Special Attack boost. Sheer Force increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30%, boosting Flare Blitz and Rock Slide. A Jolly nature is chosen over an Adamant nature to outspeed Pokemon such as Roserade, Krookodile, and Entei. The item choice is up to personal preference: Life Orb allows Darmanitan to switch moves at the cost of a little power and recoil from moves not boosted by Sheer Force (U-turn, Earthquake, and Superpower), but Choice Band grants more power and no recoil at the cost of not being able to switch moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Darmanitan can try to bluff the Choice Scarf set to lure in a Pokemon and KO it with a boosted move, but you must be careful to reveal the item at the right time. Try to bring Darmanitan in off of a U-turn, Volt Switch, or fainted teammate, as Darmanitan is used as a revenge killer and likes to save its HP for when it's using Flare Blitz. Be wary of the amount of recoil Darmanitan takes when using Flare Blitz, as the damage will quickly wear it down, especially if you failed to keep Stealth Rock and other entry hazards off of the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A spinner or Defogger is helpful to clear the field of entry hazards so Darmanitan won't be worn down as easily, especially because its most powerful STAB move has recoil. Tentacruel and Blastoise are good in this role, as they can clear entry hazards and break down Ground-, Rock-, and Fire-types, which are a nuisance to Darmanitan. Crobat also makes for a good partner in that it can clear entry hazards with Defog and form a U-turn core with Darmanitan. Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin make for good partners for their ability to take on bulky Water-types and Rhyperior. Pokemon such as Hydreigon appreciate the wallbreaking power Darmanitan brings, especially against Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse. That said, Florges and Aromatisse make for good partners due to their ability to take on Hydreigon, one of Darmanitan's best offensive checks.</p>"

Cofagrigus's amazing Defense stat allows it to take a lot of physical hits and serve as a decent tank. It also has good Special Defense and Special Attack stats, while its low Speed stat makes it a good Pokemon under Trick Room, which it can reliably set itself. Furthermore, it has a diverse support movepool ranging from Toxic Spikes to Will-O-Wisp. Lastly, Cofagrigus also has access to two good boosting moves in Calm Mind and Nasty Plot.</p> <p>Despite its numerous positives, Cofagrigus is far from perfect, as its defensive typing only grants it two resistances and two immunities. Cofagrigus is also very reliant on Trick Room to be utilized effectively. Additionally, Cofagrigus lacks a reliable recovery move, making it fairly easy to wear down coupled with its mediocre HP stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cofagrigus has a high Defense stat, making a defensive set with Will-O-Wisp and Haze an option, although its mediocre defensive typing means Cofagrigus can't utilize this effectively. Cofagrigus can use a Choice Specs set with Trick to cripple walls but is generally better off just using a Trick Room set. Cofagrigus can also utilize a Trick Room set made to specifically support its teammates with Memento and Toxic Spikes, but this set tends to be very passive on Trick Room teams which generally rely on offensive momentum. Cofagrigus also has access to Calm Mind, but it is unable to utilize it well, as it lacks a form of reliable recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Mega Absol and Hydreigon hit Cofagrigus for super effective damage with their STAB attacks and only have to worry about Hidden Power Fighting, which doesn't OHKO the majority of them, and Will-O-Wisp, which can cripple the physical attackers but doesn't really bother the special attackers.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind sweepers, namely Calm Mind Suicune and Calm Mind Florges, can easily set up on Cofagrigus with little consequence, as Cofagrigus can't do much back to them.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off is super effective against Cofagrigus and also cripples it badly, as losing Leftovers makes Cofagrigus much easier to take down.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Darmanitan and Choice Specs Kyurem can easily KO Cofagrigus with their powerful attacks, whereas Cofagrigus is unable to KO them in return.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users can easily shut Cofagrigus down, as Cofagrigus depends on support moves to be utilized effectively; Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat are just a few examples of Taunt users.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Cofagrigus is crippled by all forms of status, except paralysis, as they can either wear Cofagrigus down or just render it unable to do anything for a few turns.</p>",

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows slower Pokemon to move first, making it an excellent move in conjunction with Cofagrigus's low Speed. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move that also has a chance to lower the foe's Special Defense. Nasty Plot boosts Cofagrigus's Special Attack by two stages, making it a good sweeper under Trick Room. Hidden Power Fighting allows Cofagrigus to hit Dark-, and Normal-types for super effective damage. Will-O-Wisp is also an option, as it allows Cofagrigus to cripple physical attackers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is the chosen item because it gives Cofagrigus a form of passive recovery. The given EVs allow Cofagrigus to have as much offensive power as possible while retaining some bulk. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs are chosen to ensure Cofagrigus is as quick as possible under Trick Room.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cofagrigus should attempt to set Trick Room up as early as possible should it be attempting to support its teammates. However, should Cofagrigus be attempting to sweep, it should set up a Nasty Plot before using Trick Room, as that allows Cofagrigus to have four turns under Trick Room with a boost. Don't be afraid to sack Cofagrigus early on for the sake of letting your Trick Room sweepers have extra turns under Trick Room. However, should Cofagrigus be needed later on to set Trick Room, don't hesitate to preserve it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trick Room sweepers, such as Choice Band Escavalier and Swords Dance Rhyperior, make for good teammates, as they take advantage of Trick Room. Cofagrigus thrives on Trick Room, making additional Trick Room setters, such as Reuniclus and Cresselia, good partners. Cofagrigus has issues getting past Dark-types, therefore, Pokemon that can deal with Dark-types, such as Aromatisse and Pangoro, make for good teammates. Cofagrigus can sweep more easily with entry hazard support, making entry hazard setters such as Forretress and Bronzong good teammates.</p>"

  "Zoroark": {
    "overview": "<p>Zoroark has a decent signature ability in Illusion, which allows it to play mind games with opponents, though Zoroark's frailty limits its usability. Zoroark also has great mixed offenses and a decent movepool with moves such as Swords Dance and Nasty Plot. Furthermore, Zoroark has a good Speed tier which allows it to outspeed and beat Pokemon such as Chandelure. However, Zoroark is quite frail, meaning it can easily be revenge killed, and it is also more or less walled and beaten by common Fighting- and Fairy-types. Furthermore, Zoroark faces competition from Hydreigon and Mega Houndoom as a mixed attacker, as they have better movepools and superior offenses, though Zoroark has higher Speed and access to Illusion. As a physical attacker, Zoroark faces competition from Mega Absol, which has better coverage and power; however, Zoroark's niche lies in Illusion and the fact that it does not take up a Mega slot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>U-turn can be used to let Zoroark gain momentum and switch out of its checks and counters, but it forces Zoroark to miss out on a coverage move. Taunt can cripple defensive Pokemon but is better used by bulkier Pokemon such as Crobat. An anti-lead set with Focus Sash and moves such as Counter can be used, but it is waste of Zoroark's excellent offensive stats. Pursuit can be used to trap opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types, but Zoroark lacks room for it and it isn't really powerful. Extrasensory is an option to hit Fighting-types for super effective damage, but it lacks power and good coverage. Lastly, Memento can be an option to give setup sweepers an easier time setting up, but this wastes Zoroark's offensive potential.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Florges, Aromatisse, and Whimsicott can take Zoroark's hits and beat it with a STAB attack. However, they must be wary of Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Infernape, and Machamp can easily take out Zoroark with a powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Crobat and Speed Boost Yanmega can outspeed Zoroark and beat it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Because of Zoroark's pitiful bulk, any powerful priority attack, such as Lucario's Extreme Speed, can beat Zoroark.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is Zoroark's preferred STAB move because of its 100% accuracy and chance to make its target flinch, and unlike Night Daze, it doesn't reveal Zoroark's identity. However, Night Daze has more power and a good chance to drop its target's accuracy, though it ruins Zoroark's disguise. Focus Blast has great power and excellent coverage, allowing Zoroark to hit opposing Dark-types, which resist its STAB moves. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon, leaving them locked into a single move. Grass Knot hits heavy Pokemon quite hard, most notably Mega Swampert, Suicune, and Milotic. Sludge Bomb 2HKOes Florges, which can switch into all of Zoroark's other moves with little trouble. Flamethrower has decent power and coverage and hits Chesnaught, Forretress, and Roserade harder than Zoroark's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Illusion allows Zoroark to disguise itself as a teammate and trick opponents. Choice Specs gives an additional boost to Zoroark's Special Attack but locks it into a single move. Maximum Special Attack investment lets Zoroark hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Zoroark to outspeed base 100s such as Shaymin and Speed tie with base 105s such as Mienshao.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When selecting the team order, try to select a Pokemon that has good type synergy with Zoroark in the last slot; this way, the opponent can be tricked into hitting Zoroark with a not very effective attack, giving Zoroark a free turn to attack the foe. This Zoroark can be used as a lead to cripple entry hazard setters with Trick. Trick can also be used to cripple a defensive Pokemon by locking it into a single move; for example, if the foe goes for Toxic, it will be locked into the move and forced to switch. Bringing Zoroark in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is good, as it is too frail to switch in on its own and does not want its Illusion to be broken immediately.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that beat the Fighting-types that threaten Zoroark, such as Florges and Crobat, make for good partners. Pokemon that can beat Fairy-types for Zoroark, such as Nidoqueen, Crobat, and Mega Aggron, are also good choices. Pokemon that share good typing synergy and moves with Zoroark, such as Infernape, are useful to take advantage of Illusion. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Empoleon and Nidoqueen is appreciated in order to KO foes with more ease. Pokemon that can bring in Zoroark with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Forretress, are good teammates as well.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is Zoroark's boosting move, allowing it to boost its Attack to an insane level. Sucker Punch is a STAB attack with priority, letting Zoroark hit foes that would normally outspeed it. Knock Off is usually more powerful than Sucker Punch and also has the utility of removing the foe's item. Low Kick has great coverage and allows Zoroark to hit Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Snorlax for super effective damage. Return has decent Base Power and lets Zoroark hit Fairy-types neutrally, which it can't do without it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Illusion allows Zoroark to disguise itself as the last teammate in your party and trick opponents. Focus Sash ensures Zoroark can get a Swords Dance when at full health and allows it to play riskier by being able to hit with at least two attacks. Life Orb is a secondary option for an item for more raw power. Maximized Attack EVs are backed by an Adamant nature to ensure that Zoroark can KO Shaymin after Stealth Rock at +2 and have a chance to OHKO Krookodile at +1 . A Jolly nature can be used instead to outspeed maximum Speed Krookodile and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Sucker Punch to pick off weakened Pokemon. Use Swords Dance on a forced switch or when you predict that the foe will use a not very effective attack because of Illusion. If you're unsure what to do, use Knock Off; it does good damage and most Pokemon do not appreciate having their item removed. Bringing Zoroark in with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn is a good idea; this way, Illusion and Focus Sash will stay intact.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can reliably take care of Fairy-types that wall this set, such as Nidoqueen, Mega Aggron, and Tentacruel, make for good partners. Physical wallbreakers such as Darmanitan, Krookodile, and Haxorus are good choices because of their ability to break through physical walls. Zoroark itself is a good wallbreaker for these teammates. Pokemon that can beat Fighting-types, such as Florges and Crobat, are good partners; the former can also provide Wish support to keep Zoroark healthy. Pokemon that have good type synergy with Zoroark, such as Weezing, are excellent partners too because they let Zoroark trick opponents with Illusion better. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Forretress, and Roserade is appreciated to give Zoroark an easier time KOing foes. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Crobat and Mega Blastoise is good for Zoroark too, as hazards will break its Focus Sash. Slow momentum gainers such as Forretress and Umbreon are great teammates, as Zoroark will not like to switch in on its own.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Zoroark's Special Attack to massive levels. Dark Pulse is a STAB attack and is preferred over Night Daze for its accuracy, as the power difference doesn't matter here. Focus Blast has great Base Power and excellent coverage alongside Dark Pulse. Sludge Bomb hits Florges for super-effective damage, having a chance to OHKO it with Stealth Rock up when boosted. Flamethrower can be used in the last slot to hit Chesnaught and other Grass-types harder, as well as several other Pokemon. Grass Knot can hit heavy targets such as Mega Swampert and Rhyperior quite hard and thus is an option too.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Illusion allows Zoroark to trick opponents by disguising itself as a teammate. Life Orb gives a power boost to each of Zoroark's damaging attacks, making them even more powerful. Maximized Special Attack increases Zoroark's damage output, and the Speed EVs along with a Timid nature allow Zoroark to outspeed maximum Speed base 100s such as Entei and Flygon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Select Pokemon that have good synergy with Zoroark, such as Weezing or Lucario, in the last slot to let Zoroark benefit the most from its Illusion ability. This Zoroark can be used as a lead to set up on entry hazard setters. Nasty Plot should be used on a forced switch, as it will allow Zoroark to sweep. Zoroark should be brought in with a slow momentum-gaining move such as U-turn or Volt Switch, as it doesn't like taking an attack while switching in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that have good synergy with Zoroark allow for optimal use of Illusion, so they're good teammates. Weezing stands out, as it has perfect typing synergy with Zoroark. Zoroark is walled by Fairy-types, so Pokemon that beat them, such as Toxicroak and Mega Aggron, are excellent choices as well. Fighting-types such as Mienshao threaten Zoroark, so checks or counters to them, such as Florges and Espeon, are nice teammates. Special attackers that can't set up on their own, such as Raikou and Shaymin, can take advantage of Zoroark breaking through special walls, so they are generally good partners. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Forretress is excellent to give Zoroark an easier time KOing foes. Entry hazards on your side limit Zoroark's longevity every time it switches in, so a teammate that can remove them, such as Flygon, is good. Slow momentum gainers such as Forretress are good, as they can provide a safe switch in for Zoroark.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch is a priority move that packs good power and is boosted by STAB. Knock Off is a powerful attack that has the utility of removing foes' items. Low Kick heavily damages Pokemon such as Blissey, Snorlax, and Hydreigon, which would otherwise wall this set. Sludge Bomb hits Florges for super-effective damage. Flamethrower hits several Pokemon for super effective damage. Grass Knot hits heavy Pokemon very hard and has decent coverage, but it can be very weak against lightweight foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Illusion can help Zoroark trick opposing players by disguising it as one of its teammates. Life Orb gives a boost to all of Zoroark's damaging attacks. The given spread boosts Zoroark's offenses and allows it to OHKO Mega Swampert and Rhyperior with Grass Knot. The Speed EVs are furthered by a Naive nature, allowing Zoroark to outrun maximum Speed base 100s such as Shaymin and Entei.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Zoroark can be used as a revenge killer because of its good offensive stats and Speed. It's useful to disguise Zoroark as a teammate with the same move choices and preferably good typing to optimize Illusion's use. Use Knock Off if unsure what the foe's going to do, because most Pokemon do not appreciate having their item removed. Zoroark can also come in to pick off a weakened Pokemon with Sucker Punch after a teammate has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with the same movepool options or good typing synergy are good partners for Zoroark. Pokemon that beat the Fighting-types that can easily beat Zoroark, such as Noivern and Florges, are nice teammates. Fairy-types threaten this set, so Poison- or Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Toxicroak, and Escavalier are good choices. Entry hazard removal is useful for keeping Zoroark healthy, as it cannot recover the damage taken. Slow momentum gainers such as Forretress and Vaporeon can grant Zoroark a safe switch in, which is good.</p>"

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to its good overall bulk and power, Reuniclus is one of the premier Psychic-types in the tier. Most walls can't touch it after it gets a Calm Mind under its belt, as its access to recovery and good bulk let it set up on a large portion of the tier, and it is unaffected by residual damage thanks to Magic Guard, which also benefits Trick Room sets greatly, as Reuniclus won't have to worry about taking recoil from Life Orb. Reuniclus also has a huge base 125 Special Attack, which complements its bulk nicely and makes it dangerous for offensive teams to face if it sets up Trick Room. However, there are a good number of flaws that hold Reuniclus back, as its Speed is horrendous outside of Trick Room, which makes it vulnerable to common offensive Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Heracross when coupled with its mediocre defensive typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set can be run to turn Reuniclus into a deadly nuke, but it's too slow to pull it off effectively, and it hates being locked into one move. Knock Off can be used to cripple Pokemon that are reliant on their item. Acid Armor can be used in conjunction with Calm Mind to turn Reuniclus into an extremely bulky wincon, but its lack of coverage forces it to have all Dark-types removed in order for it to sweep. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back Taunt and phazing moves directed at Reuniclus, but other than that, it has very little use considering Reuniclus is immune to passive damage. Kee Berry can be used to boost its Defense, somewhat like Acid Armor, and lets it run a coverage move, but Reuniclus usually wants the passive recovery from Leftovers. Regenerator can be used on offensive sets so that Reuniclus regains a little health each time it switches in, but it would much rather have Magic Guard so that it doesn't have to take passive damage from entry hazards, status, and Life Orb recoil. Other moves with smaller uses such as Grass Knot can be used, but Reuniclus rarely has the space to run them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Mega Houndoom are immune to Reuniclus's STAB attacks, take little damage from Shadow Ball, and can all OHKO an unboosted Reuniclus with their STAB attacks, but all must be wary of Focus Blast. In a similar vein, Spiritomb can wall the Calm Mind set if Reuniclus is running Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Escavalier can switch into all of Reuniclus's attacks with little trouble thanks to its typing and can threaten it out with a STAB Megahorn. Heracross, Mega Beedrill, Galvantula, and Durant can also force Reuniclus out; however, they usually have to be brought in safely because they all either have poor Special Defense or are weak to Reuniclus's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Chandelure</strong>: Choice Specs Chandelure can OHKO Reuniclus with little trouble, and Substitute + Calm Mind or Choice Scarf variants can easily threaten it. However, Chandelure usually has to be brought in safely due to its weakness to Shadow Ball.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind is used to boost Reuniclus's Special Attack and Special Defense and complements its overall good natural bulk and offenses. Psyshock is used as Reuniclus's primary STAB move, as it lets Reuniclus win Calm Mind wars against Pokemon such as Suicune and Cresselia and do more damage to Florges and Blissey than Psychic. Psychic can be used instead, however, as it does more damage to physical walls such as Chesnaught and lets Reuniclus beat Curse users such as Snorlax if running Shadow Ball. Focus Blast hits Steel-types such as Aggron and Empoleon for super effective damage and threatens Dark-types such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, Absol, and Sharpedo. Signal Beam can be used instead to still gain coverage versus Dark-types, but allows Reuniclus to nail Celebi. Shadow Ball hits opposing Psychic-types such as Slowking and Cresselia for super effective damage, as well as Chandelure and Doublade, the latter of which beats Reuniclus easily otherwise. Thunder Wave can also be used over Focus Blast to cripple some of Reuniclus's checks, such as Hydreigon, Mandibuzz, and Chandelure, although this means it has no way of dealing damage to Dark-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EV investment in HP and Defense along with a Bold nature are used so that Reuniclus can take as many physical attacks as possible, as its Special Defense stat will be boosted by Calm Mind. Magic Guard should always be used, as it prevents Reuniclus from taking passive damage, which is extremely useful, as then it doesn't have to worry about taking entry hazard damage or being worn down by Toxic; this also lets it run Life Orb without taking recoil, making it significantly more powerful, even when unboosted. Leftovers is the primary item, however, as passive recovery makes Reuniclus less reliant on using Recover and lets it focus more on boosting.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Reuniclus should usually try to set up Calm Mind after Dark-, Bug-, and Ghost-types have been removed, as they can usually 2HKO Reuniclus even after a boost. However, it should be trying to set up against weak Pokemon that cannot 2HKO it, such as Alomomola and Florges, as it can shrug off their attacks with little trouble thanks to Recover, and Reuniclus usually forces the foe to provide enough offensive pressure to either force it out, 2HKO it, or phaze it. Reuniclus should usually be kept healthy before attempting to set up, as letting it get worn down too quickly without recovering makes it difficult for it to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can switch into Bug- and Dark-type Pokemon, such as Sylveon, Florges, and Aromatisse, are good partners for Reuniclus, as they can tank any hits from them with little trouble, threaten them with a STAB Moonblast, or pass Wishes to Reuniclus if need be. As Reuniclus forces out a lot of defensive Pokemon, entry hazard support is appreciated. Spikes in particular helps Reuniclus set up a sweep, as most of its checks and counters are grounded and get worn down by entry hazard damage. Chesnaught pairs well with Reuniclus, as it can reliably set up Spikes and can sponge Dark-type attacks aimed at Reuniclus. Due to the fact that Reuniclus can set up on many walls found on balanced or stall teams, late-game cleaners that do well against offense, such as Choice Scarf Mienshao, Swords Dance Lucario, and Dragon Dance Feraligatr, are all good partners for Reuniclus. Mienshao and Lucario also aid Reuniclus in sweeping by checking Dark-types.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room is a valuable tool against offensive teams, as it turns Reuniclus into a powerful late-game cleaner, making it the fastest Pokemon on the field in some cases. Psyshock is the primary STAB attack and is used to hit special walls such as Florges and Blissey for more damage than Psychic. Psychic has more overall power than Psyshock and hits physical walls such as Rhyperior for more damage. Focus Blast is used to hit Dark- and Steel-types such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Mega Aggron, OHKOing the former two and 2HKOing the latter. Signal Beam loses coverage on Steel-types, but allows Reuniclus to take down Celebi with ease. Shadow Ball is used to hit other Psychic-types such as opposing Reuniclus, Slowking, and Cresselia for super effective damage, along with Chandelure.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is used so that Reuniclus can maximize its bulk and power, while having a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs allows it to outspeed nearly everything in Trick Room. Life Orb is used to boost Reuniclus's power without taking recoil thanks to Magic Guard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's usually best for Reuniclus to set up Trick Room late-game when most of its checks have been removed or weakened, as despite its good bulk, it will usually only get one chance to set up Trick Room and use it effectively against offensive teams. Because of this, it should also set up Trick Room as soon as it comes into the field. Unlike other Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia or Bronzong, it is best used to take advantage of Trick Room by itself due to its offensive nature.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is appreciated to weaken foes for Reuniclus when it sets up Trick Room, so partners such as Forretress, Swampert, Chesnaught, and Dragalge work well with it. While it isn't mandatory in most cases, having other Pokemon that can take advantage of Trick Room, such as Mega Abomasnow, Mega Camerupt, Choice Band Snorlax, and Escavalier, is appreciated, as they can punch holes into defensive teams if brought in safely and can also potentially clean in Trick Room. If Reuniclus is run on a balanced team, having Pokemon that can repeatedly switch into and threaten Dark- and Bug-types such as Heracross, Krookodile, and Mega Absol help it a lot. Sylveon, Florges, and Aromatisse are very good partners, as they can switch into all of the aforementioned Pokemon and pass Wishes to Reuniclus if necessary. Aromatisse can also set up Trick Room if Reuniclus is able to clean late-game but cannot find the opportunity to set up Trick Room itself.</p>"

  "Escavalier": {
    "overview": "<p>Escavalier finds a niche in the UnderUsed tier due to its amazing base 135 Attack, which allows it to function as an extremely effective wallbreaker. Escavalier also has good overall bulk, allowing it to take many hits in conjunction with its amazing Bug / Steel typing, which grants Escavalier eight resistances and a Poison-type immunity. Despite having those excellent resistances and immunity, Escavalier's typing leaves it weak to a very common offensive typing in Fire. Escavalier also has base 20 Speed, which is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the low Speed allows Escavalier to function as an effective Trick Room abuser. On the other hand, it makes Escavalier one of the slowest Pokemon in the UnderUsed tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Escavalier can use a RestTalk set with Swords Dance to effectively break stall, but this set is walled by various Pokemon that resist Bug-type attacks, such as Chandelure, Crobat, and Mega Aerodactyl. Swarm can be used to give a boost to Megahorn once Escavalier is weakened, as Overcoat isn't always useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon with Fire-type Moves</strong>: Pokemon that commonly use Fire-type moves, such as Entei and Hidden Power Fire Roserade, can easily KO Escavalier with said moves, although they can't switch into it easily.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls, such as Suicune and Chesnaught, easily wall non-Choice Band variants of Escavalier, as they aren't 2HKOed by any move Escavalier can throw at them and can proceed to stall Escavalier out.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Burns easily cripple Escavalier by halving its Attack, making it setup bait for various Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Heracross and Life Orb Nidoqueen, can OHKO and 2HKO Escavalier, respectively.

Knock Off gives good neutral coverage in conjunction with Escavalier's STAB attacks and allows Escavalier to remove the foe's held item. Drill Run is used to give Escavalier super effective coverage against Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types. On the other hand, Pursuit allows Escavalier to get chip damage against the various Pokemon it forces out, such as Celebi and Cresselia.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Attack EVs and nature maximize Escavalier's damage output. The Speed EVs allow Escavalier to outspeed up to uninvested base 30 Speed Pokemon, such as Reuniclus and Slowking. The remaining EVs are put into HP and Special Defense to augment Escavalier's bulk while ensuring Porygon2 and Porygon-Z don't get a Special Attack boost via Download. A Choice Band boosts Escavalier's Attack, making it a dangerous wallbreaker. Overcoat ensures Escavalier can't be put to sleep via powder moves, namely Spore and Sleep Powder. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature should be used if Escavalier is being used on a Trick Room team.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure to scout for Fire-type moves commonly used by offensive Pokemon Escavalier checks, such as Hidden Power Fire on Roserade. Use Grass-, Poison-, Bug-, and Psychic-type Pokemon that cannot KO Escavalier as opportunities to switch in and punch holes in the opposing team. Escavalier will be locked into a move until it switches out, so be sure to predict well, as being locked into an unfavorable move is easily exploited.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Escavalier lures in Fire-types, making Pokemon that take advantage of this, such as Suicune and Flash Fire Chandelure, good teammates. Cleaners and sweepers, such as Gyarados and Swords Dance Lucario, also make for good teammates, as they capitalize on Escavalier's ability to punch holes in the opposing team. Wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Band Entei, make for good partners, as they form wallbreaking cores with Escavalier that can power through defensive teams. Pokemon that have a Water-type immunity, such as Dry Skin Toxicroak and Heliolisk, make for good teammates, as they take advantage of the bulky Water-types that attempt to burn Escavalier via Scald.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Megahorn is a powerful STAB attack that dents most Pokemon, but it has a miss chance. Iron Head is a secondary STAB attack that destroys the Fairy-types that resist Megahorn. Pursuit allows Escavalier to get chip damage against the various Pokemon it forces out, such as Celebi and Reuniclus, and it cleanly OHKOes Hoopa and deals heavy damage to Mega Beedrill on the switch. Knock Off provides good utility, removing the held items of opposing Pokemon. Protect allows Escavalier to garner an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and scout Choice item users such as Entei, Mienshao, and Chandelure. Toxic nails bulky Pokemon that check Escavalier, such as Arcanine, and Chesnaught. Alternatively, Drill Run can be used to provide Escavalier with a way to hit Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-type Pokemon for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs and the Special Defense investment allows Escavalier to reliably check various threats such as Celebi, Sylveon, Venomoth, Reuniclus, Mega Beedrill, and Cresselia. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack along with an Adamant nature to augment Escavalier's Attack. Leftovers is the preferred item to allow Escavalier to stay relatively healty throughout the match.</p> <p>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with a 0 Speed IV and a Brave nature can be used if Escavalier is being used on a Trick Room team. An Assault Vest can be used instead of Leftovers with an EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe and an Adamant nature to allow Escavalier to outspeed base 30 Speed Pokemon and hit significantly harder, while retaining the ability to take on various special attackers in the tier. Keep in mind though that using an Assault Vest means that Escavalier will be worn down very quickly in conjunction with entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Escavalier to check the various special attackers it deals with, such as non-Fire Blast Hydreigon and Celebi. Escavalier is easily worn down, so be sure to keep it healthy if it is still required to check special attackers. Prediction is the key to effectively utilizing Escavalier, as it forces many switches. Escavalier can use bulky Psychic-types as opportunities to switch in, because Escavalier resists most moves they throw at it, and threatens them with a STAB Megahorn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wish passers with access to clerical moves, such as Sylveon and Umbreon, make for good teammates, as they can heal Escavalier with Wish as well as cure burns Escavalier might gain. Fire-types are Escavalier's biggest threats, making Water- and Rock-types, such as Suicune and Diancie, good partners, as they can switch into most Fire-type attackers and hit them for super effective damage with their STAB attacks. Rapid Spin and Defog users, such as Forretress and Crobat, respectively, also make for good teammates, as they can remove entry hazards that wear down Escavalier. This Escavalier set is easily walled by bulky Water-types that can burn Escavalier with Scald, making Pokemon that take advantage of bulky Water-types, such as Celebi and Reuniclus, good partners.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Escavalier's Attack stat by two stages, making it a deadly wallbreaker. Megahorn hits extremely hard, especially after a Swords Dance boost. Iron Head is very consistent and punishes Fairy-type Pokemon such as Sylveon that resist Megahorn. Knock Off provides Escavalier with good neutral coverage, as well as the ability to remove the held items of opposing Pokemon. Facade can be used in the fourth moveslot to ensure Escavalier isn't shut down by burns; however, it leaves Escavalier walled by Steel-types. Drill Run is another option, allowing it to hit Steep-type Pokemon such as Cobalion for excellent damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and nature maximize Escavalier's bulk while allowing it to outspeed up to uninvested base 30 Speed Pokemon and hitting a jump point in Attack. Overcoat allows Escavalier to have an immunity to commonly used sleep-inducing powder moves, namely Spore and Sleep Powder. Leftovers gives Escavalier a form of passive recovery, making Escavalier harder to wear down. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD with a Brave nature and a 0 Speed IV can be used to underspeed Forretress and move after its Volt Switch, allowing Escavalier to get a hit off on the incoming Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure to set up when facing defensive teams, but avoid doing so against offensive teams. Should Facade be chosen over Knock Off on the fourth moveslot, be sure to remove Steel-types before attempting to punch holes in the opposing team. Always scout for Fire-type attacks, as they can easily OHKO Escavalier. Escavalier beats most bulky Psychic-types one-on-one and can easily take most moves they throw at it, so be sure to use bulky Psychic-types as opportunities to switch Escavalier in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters, such as Nidoqueen and Swampert, make for good teammates, as they can make it easier for Escavalier to wallbreak. Cleaners, such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Shell Smash Cloyster, make for good partners, as they capitalize on Escavalier's ability to dismantle defensive cores. Sweepers such as Dragon Dance Gyarados appreciate Escavalier's wallbreaking capabilities, making them good teammates. Escavalier lacks a form of reliable recovery, making Wish passers, such as Sylveon and Alomomola, good teammates.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Jellicent's unique Water / Ghost typing allows it to check a plethora of Pokemon in UU, such as Mienshao and Entei. Water Absorb allows Jellicent to wall a large amount of bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Empoleon and Suicune, as it doesn't fear Scald burns. Jellicent also has great 100 / 70 / 105 bulk that allows it to tank physical and special hits with ease. It also has access to reliable recovery in Recover, meaning it can withstand many hits throughout the match. However, Jellicent's typing leaves it weak to Knock Off, which a lot of the Fighting-types it should wall, such as Mienshao and Heracross, tend to carry. Jellicent is a bit slow, and, as a result, cannot Taunt many fast Pokemon effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD can make use of Jellicent's better Special Defense stat; however, most of Jellicent's weaknesses are to special moves, and the Pokemon it should wall are physical attackers. Colbur Berry can be used instead of Leftovers, as Jellicent still has access to recovery without it, and the item allows Jellicent to tank powerful Dark-type moves and retaliate with Scald or Will-O-Wisp. Trick Room is a nice support option for teammates such as Mega Abomasnow, allowing them to outspeed Pokemon that they normally wouldn't outspeed. Jellicent itself can abuse Trick Room, launching powerful STAB Water Spouts. Remember to use 0 Speed IVs and a negative nature to be as fast as possible under Trick Room.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Most common Dark-types, such as Hydreigon and Absol, are not only able to threaten Jellicent with a super effective STAB move, but also outspeed it. However, burns from Scald or Will-O-Wisp cripple a lot of Dark-types, so they cannot switch in reliably.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Celebi and Shaymin, with their ability Natural Cure, can wall Jellicent, as they resist Scald and can cripple Jellicent with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Heliolisk, Galvantula, and Mega Ampharos all are able to 2HKO or OHKO after prior damage with their STAB move of choice, while Jellicent can't do much in return. Heliolisk deserves an special mention, as it is immune to both of Jellicent's STAB moves, only being affected by status.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Guts</strong>: Pokemon such as Heracross and Machamp can come in and take advantage of Jellicent's prowess at spreading status, as they gain an Attack boost from it, enabling them to overpower Jellicent.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Recover grants Jellicent with the ability to reliably heal any damage it has taken. Scald can inflict burns, allowing Jellicent to take physical hits better. Shadow Ball can be used as a STAB move, as Ghost-types have one resistance and one immunity. Will-O-Wisp spreads burns more easily than Scald, while Toxic puts special attackers and other Pokemon not bothered by burns on a timer. Taunt allows Jellicent to beat slow setup sweepers such as Suicune while also blocking recovery from Pokemon such as Umbreon and Florges.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides Jellicent with passive recovery. Maximum HP and Defense EVs allow Jellicent to take physical hits better, as it already has decent special bulk. The last 4 EVs are put into Speed to outrun other base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Empoleon. A Bold nature is used to further augment Jellicent's physical bulk. An alternate EV spread of 240 HP / 64 Def / 204 Spe can be used to outrun base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Suicune and Gligar and beat them one-on-one. However, this cuts significantly into Jellicent's physical bulk and makes it less reliable for taking powerful attacks such as Entei's Sacred Fire. A compromise between bulk and a fast Taunt can be achieved by tailoring the Speed EVs to outspeed certain walls; for example, 44 EVs outspeed base 65s such as Umbreon and Alomomola, while 124 EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed Florges.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jellicent should be coming in on bulky setup Pokemon such as Cresselia, Snorlax, and Suicune, to beat them 1v1, as Taunt shuts down their setup and recovery moves. Jellicent can also come in on weak special hits because its great special bulk and its immunities allow for more switch-ins than normal; however, it must be wary, as most of the Fighting-types that it walls carry Knock Off. Jellicent can also check a plethora of common physical attackers such as Entei, Darmanitan, Mega Swampert, Cobalion, and Lucario. Jellicent's access to Taunt, which shuts down all forms of reliable recovery and status moves, allows it to wear down the foe fairly quickly with its own status moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Ground-types such as Gligar and Krookodile appreciate Jellicent's Water-type immunity and can provide Stealth Rock support. Krookodile in particular is a great partner, as its Dark typing covers Jellicent's weaknesses. Entry hazard support is essential, as Jellicent can force a lot of switches and shut down recovery on slower Pokemon. Partners such as Forretress and Krookodile can lay down Stealth Rock, and Jellicent can spinblock fairly well thanks to its Ghost typing. Entry hazard removal is also great, as Jellicent is susceptible to all types of entry hazards. Pokemon such as Forretress or Crobat can provide reliable Rapid Spin and Defog support and can help keep momentum with Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively, allowing Jellicent to come in safely. Cleric support from Sylveon is great, as Jellicent hates being worn down by status ailments, which it cannot get rid of on its own.</p>"

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alomomola is one of many reliable bulky Water-types available in the UnderUsed tier. What sets Alomomola apart from Pokemon such as Vaporeon is Alomomola's higher physical bulk and its Regenerator ability, which allows Alomomola to act as a defensive pivot in a Underused metagame that loves opportunities to retain momentum. As such, with its massive base 165 HP stat, Alomomola fits extremely well in UnderUsed as one of the premier Wish users. Despite having poor base Special Defense, Regenerator and reliable teammate options such as Blissey and Gligar allow Alomomola to fit well on many balance cores, although it has the necessary bulk to be effective on stall teams as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Waterfall can be used instead of Scald in order to use Alomomola's less pitiful Attack, but only with Toxic. Healing Wish can be used as a last-ditch effort to heal a late-game win condition.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Ampharos, Heliolisk, and Rotom-C cause significant damage to Alomomola with Thunderbolt and Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Shaymin and Roserade can OHKO Alomomola with their strong STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Guts Heracross</strong>: Heracross's Attack gets boosted by 1.5x when afflicted by status, which allows it to easily 2HKO Alomomola.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Substitute + Calm Mind users such as Cresselia or Suicune have no problem setting up on Alomomola. Physical attackers with Substitute such as Cobalion and Feraligatr can set up on it, but they need to beware of switching into a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Chandelure, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Hydreigon are notable examples of powerful special attackers that force Alomomola to often partner up with Blissey or Florges.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Alomomola needs to be careful when it switches into Pokemon that can use Taunt, even if it has the type advantage, as they limit Alomomola's support capabilities.</p>",

      "Sunfish Wish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is an effective move despite Alomomola's poor Special Attack, as the 30% chance to burn pays off in the long term against physical threats ranging from Haxorus to Escavalier. Wish is Alomomola's main support move, reliably healing its teammates for a large amount of health due to Alomomola's incredibly high base HP. Protect works well alongside Wish, providing Alomomola with a reliable way of healing itself. Knock Off is another niche that separates Alomomola from Vaporeon, providing additional support for its team. Toxic is another useful support option to whittle down opposing bulky threats such as Chesnaught. Mirror Coat can be used to get a surprise OHKO on special attackers such as Choice Scarf Rotom, Life Orb Nidoqueen, and non-Choice Specs Chandelure. However, due to Mirror Coat's Psychic typing, it will not work on Dark-Type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Alomomola's huge base 165 HP stat means it can afford to invest its EVs in other areas. 252 Def EVs are used to maximize Alomomola's physical defenses, making it able to take multiple hits alongside its Regenerator ability. The 216 EVs are placed into Alomomola's subpar Special Defense, allowing it to absorb a variety of neutral special attacks, such as a Moonblast from Florges. The remaining 40 HP EVs round out Alomomola's overall bulk. A Bold nature is used alongside Scald, but an Impish nature can be used if you want a slightly more powerful Knock Off. Regenerator is an incredible ability for Alomomola, recovering one third of its HP every time it is switched out. Rocky Helmet is a good option if passive recovery is not a priority, as it is perfect against common physical attackers, such as common users of U-turn, and will wear down their HP while Alomomola shrugs off the hit with Regenerator.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Alomomola in on physical attackers, though beware of Swords Dance users. Absorb hits, and then use the appropriate supporting move. Alomomola has a hard time dealing with setup sweepers, and should never stay in during these scenarios. Instead, utilize Alomomola in a sponge-and-switch manner.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey, Gligar, and Roserade all make perfect bulky companions to build a bulky core. for instance, Gligar supports Alomomola against Guts Heracross and other physical wallbreakers. Physical wallbreakers will get past clerics, such as Umbreon and Florges, that prevent Alomomola from spreading status conditions against more defensive teams. Bulky Water-types are easily placed on a team with a Grass- and Fire-type Pokemon; Pokemon such as Arcanine, Shaymin, and Celebi make for excellent teammates in a Fire-Water-Grass core to support offensive teammates. Alomomola has an easy time against Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, so it is an ideal teammate for Florges on stall teams. Alomomola appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support so that it can get the most out of its Regenerator recovery. Because Alomomola struggles with most setup sweepers, especially if they have Substitute, it appreciates phazers such as Mega Aggron and Whirlwind Snorlax, as well as Whimsicott with Encore. Furthermore, Mandibuzz's access to Taunt makes it a great candidate for taking on Suicune and Reuniclus and preventing their setup.</p>"

  "Galvantula": {
    "overview": "<p>Galvantula is outclassed offensively by Heliolisk, which sits in a better Speed tier, has access to Dry Skin to deal with the plethora of bulky Water-types in UnderUsed, and has better diversity in its movesets. Galvantula faces competition from within its Speed tier too, as it is filled with other offensive threats such as Cobalion and Infernape.</p> <p>On top of that, it is held back by a poor defensive typing against many threats, falling to almost anything faster than it unless it can set up Sticky Web beforehand. This typing also leaves Galvantula weak to Stealth Rock, and with its reliance on Life Orb to deal any large amount of damage, Galvantula can quickly find itself struggling to survive against residual damage if left without support.</p> <p>However, Galvantula provides a useful niche with its access to Sticky Web, which reduces the foe's Speed by one stage upon switching in. To further its offensive prowess, Galvantula receives a blessing in the form of Compound Eyes, which provides a massive accuracy boost to its powerful STAB move Thunder, helping it to compete with the other Electric-types in the tier. Additionally, with Bug Buzz and Energy Ball, Galvantula can decimate some of the more common Electric-type switch-ins such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Swampert. With Galvantula's dual STAB moves, most Taunt users are not safe from it, nor are the many common entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Empoleon, and Crobat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Volt Switch can give Galvantula momentum, though it comes at the expense of power and forces you to predict what move is coming to avoid losing a teammate. Thunder Wave is an alternative speed control option that quarters a single Pokemon's Speed without affecting the rest of the team as Sticky Web would. However, Thunder Wave does carry the benefit of being less reliant on pressuring Defoggers and spinners. Choice Specs is another option, though with the increase in power comes a decrease in versatility, and it can give the opponent a free turn to switch in and use Defog or Rapid Spin. Hidden Power Ice is a final option that allows Galvantula to 2HKO Nidoqueen and Gligar, paving the way for a sweeper such as Lucario to finish the job. Sucker Punch, although almost useless in most situations, allows Galvantula to easily pick off Pokemon that were protected by a Focus Sash or Sturdy, and can help to clean up severely weakened teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Offensive Pokemon that outrun Galvantula such as Heliolisk and Crobat can do large amounts of damage, if not outright OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Reliable Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: With Galvantula's main niche being Sticky Web, reliable entry hazard removal on the opposing team can easily make Galvantula far less useful.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority Moves</strong>: Strong priority moves from the likes of Entei and Mega Absol can OHKO Galvantula due to its less than stellar bulk.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Galvantula cannot do much damage to special walls, such as Blissey and Florges, or naturally bulky pokemon such as Porygon2, and they can easily heal off damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sticky Web is the only reason to be running Galvantula, and with it Galvantula can take advantage of faster grounded Pokemon by slowing them down. In a tier full of bulky Water- and Flying-types, Galvantula can pull its weight by using Thunder as a reliable high-powered STAB move to 2HKO most of them. Bug Buzz, the secondary STAB move, combats some common Electric-type switch-ins, such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Mega Sceptile, while also threatening bulky Psychic-type Pokemon such as Cresselia. Energy Ball allows Galvantula to hit Ground-types, such as Swampert and Mamoswine, which would otherwise almost completely wall it. Giga Drain is an option to help Galvantula last slightly longer, but it is notably weaker than Energy Ball.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is almost mandatory to grant Galvantula the kind of power it requires, as otherwise it lacks any kind of meaningful damage output due to a lackluster Special Attack stat. Investing 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature gets Galvantula up to 346 Speed, on par with Cobalion and Infernape, while 252 Special Attack EVs grant it the most power it can afford. Compound Eyes allows Galvantula to have a 91% accurate Thunder, though Swarm can be used on a Focus Sash set to boost the power of Bug Buzz. Focus Sash is a viable alternative to Life Orb, though Galvantula loses power and usually only functions well as a dedicated lead if using such. However, with a Focus Sash equipped, it can OHKO common anti-lead pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Mega Absol, and Espeon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Galvantula appreciates being able to get on the field as unharmed as possible, so bringing it in on a predicted status move or switch can be very beneficial. From there, depending on the team, set up Sticky Web or attack; if the opposing team is offensive, setting up Sticky Web should be a priority, while against defensive teams an attack may have more of an impact than the Speed drop. Galvantula can also wallbreak with Thunder, and once its checks and counters are removed it can clean up a weakened team. When playing against teams with little to no entry hazard control, a good option is to simply lead with Galvantula to set up Sticky Web on turn one, especially if it is holding a Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong but slower setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Lucario and Choice Specs Sylveon appreciate Sticky Web support, as they can blow by some checks and counters by virtue of being able to outspeed them. Mamoswine in particular is absolutely terrifying on any Sticky Web team, complementing Galvantula's typing nicely and providing immense firepower. Other options include Crawdaunt, Hoopa, Nidoking, Honchkrow, and Porygon-Z, as they are all slower Pokemon with massive amounts of power, thus benefitting from Sticky Web. A teammate to resist Flying-type attacks would be particularly useful, as Flying-types are the only Pokemon other than Levitate users that are unaffected by Sticky Web in the first place. Mega Aerodactyl is a strong offensive teammate that can provide Pursuit support and attack Flying-types that trouble Galvantula. Metagross can take advantage of Sticky Web while also resisting Flying-type attacks and is able to break through special walls such as Sylveon.</p> <p>Keeping pressure on Defoggers and spinners is vital, as they remove entry hazards and undo your work. Taunt Mega Houndoom, Mamoswine, and Swords Dance + Stone Edge Cobalion all do the job nicely. Sticky Web in general favors this kind of offense by keeping pressure on and forcing opponents out, though bulky offense works just as well, as the teammates normally found on that build can stomach a hit and punish with a powerful attack in return.</p>"

This allows it to utilize an effective revenge-killing Choice Scarf set and a wallbreaking Choice Specs set. Unfortunately, poor base 60 HP lets its checks and counters easily revenge kill it. Additionally, Chandelure's subpar base 80 Speed means that anything with base 145 Speed or higher, such as Mega Aerodactyl, will outspeed and OHKO Choice Scarf Chandelure, and Chandelure's typing and lack of bulk makes it Pursuit bait.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Expert Belt is an option to bluff a Choice set. A bulkier Substitute + Calm Mind set can be used, decreasing the Speed EVs to hit lower benchmarks such as 242 for Adamant Honchkrow and uninvested base 100s. Hidden Power Fighting hits Pokemon that resist Chandelure's STAB moves, such as Hydreigon and Houndoom. A Substitute + Pain Split set with Life Orb can be effective, particularly against Pokemon with high HP such as Vaporeon and Snorlax, as Pain Split takes advantage of Chandelure's low HP. Taunt stops various Pokemon from setting up and healing. Will-O-Wisp is great against some switch-ins, such as Assault Vest Machamp, Mega Aerodactyl, and Snorlax. Trick Room is another option and works particularly well with Memento.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune, Empoleon, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel all absorb Chandelure's attacks fairly well and can generally beat Chandelure in a one-on-one situation with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Hydreigon</strong>: Hydreigon is the most common and strongest offensive check against Chandelure bar Snorlax. A Dark Pulse or Draco Meteor will OHKO Chandelure, or cripple one of its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit users such as Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl can easily force Chandelure to switch and revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: The Choice Scarf set will have trouble breaking through Umbreon, Blissey, and Florges, as they all wall Chandelure's special attacks, with Trick being Chandelure's only option to effectively work around Blissey and Florges. Fortunately, Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure can work around both of these threats.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Snorlax and Conkeldurr are among the common Assault Vest users that can survive a Choice Specs-boosted Fire Blast and OHKO Chandelure.</p>",

Energy Ball is useful for revenge killing weakened bulky Water- and Ground-types and OHKOes Swampert. Trick is a good option against stall teams or bulky Pokemon that attempt to work around Chandelure's wallbreaking ability, as well as against win condition Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax.

Flash Fire allows Chandelure to absorb Fire-type moves such as Sacred Fire and Flare Blitz and proceed to use Fire Blast at 1.5x power. Flame Body can be used instead of Flash Fire to cripple physical attackers that can take advantage of Chandelure's middling Defense stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Choice Scarf Chandelure as a revenge killer or moderately powerful special wallbreaker. Chandelure can be used as an anti-lead but is much more effective as a late-game cleaner or mid-game revenge killer. Chandelure can be an effective spinblocker against Forretress, but it fears Tentacruel and Donphan for Scald and Earthquake, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Celebi or Rotom-C can take on most bulky Water- and Ground-types that threaten to OHKO Chandelure due to its horrid bulk. Chandelure also partners well with Protect users, which can scout out Choice-locked Fighting-, Normal-, and Fire-type moves that Chandelure can switch into. Conkeldurr and Life Orb Lucario are good partners to get past some of Chandelure's specially defensive checks, such as Sylveon and Blissey. Dark-types such as Hydreigon can relieve some offensive pressure while mitigating Chandelure's Ghost- and Water-type weakness. Chandelure's weakness to Stealth Rock is a huge detriment to its wallbreaking ability. As a result, Rapid Spin and Defog users like Tentacruel and Mandibuzz increase Chandelure's longevity. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Abomasnow make strong offensive partners, especially when Chandelure is using Memento.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast hits even Chandelure's common switch-ins, like Hydreigon, for decent damage while OHKOing all moderately bulky threats that do not resist it, such as Nidoqueen. Flamethrower is an alternative, reliable Fire-type STAB move OHKOing most frail Pokemon thanks to Choice Specs but sports a noticable dip in power. Shadow Ball is the standard go-to Ghost-type STAB move if the opponent's team can handle Fire-type moves or if the opponent has an apparent Ghost-type weakness to exploit. Energy Ball is useful for revenge killing slightly weakened bulky Water- and Ground-types and OHKOes Swampert; however, Chandelure still won't be OHKOing any of its bulky Water- and Ground-type checks and counters without prior damage. Trick is a good option against stall teams or bulky Pokemon that attempt to work around Chandelure's wallbreaking ability.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs allow Chandelure to wallbreak as easily as possible. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid Nature allow Chandelure to outspeed most walls, letting it perform its wallbreaking role effectively. A Modest nature can be used to secure a 2HKO against Florges after Stealth Rock, although Timid is generally the better nature because it allows Chandelure to outspeed neutral base 90s. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to absorb Fire-type spam moves like Sacred Fire and Flare Blitz, and use Flamethrower or Fire Blast at 1.5x power. Flame Body can be used to punish physical attacks, and is also useful for hitting Porygon2, who otherwise walls Chandelure due to Trace.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Choice Specs Chandelure as a high-powered special wallbreaker with the capability of 2HKOing the majority of the tier that doesn't resist it. Chandelure is very effective as a mid-game wallbreaker or revenge killer against bulkier Pokemon such as a partially injured Mega Blastoise or Suicune. Chandelure can easily dismantle balanced teams, OHKOing the common Life Orb Nidoqueen and Choice Band Metagross while 2HKOing many Pokemon common on balance teams, ranging from Mega Ampharos to Sylveon. Chandelure can be an effective spinblocker against Forretress, but it fears Tentacruel and Donphan for Scald and Earthquake, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vaporeon can take on most bulky Water- and Ground-types that threaten to OHKO Chandelure due to its horrid bulk. Chandelure also partners well with Protect users, which can scout out Choice-locked Fighting-, Normal-, and Fire-type moves that Chandelure can switch into. Choice Band Machamp and Life Orb Lucario are good partners to get past some of Chandelure's specially defensive checks, such as Umbreon and Blissey. Dark-types such as Hydreigon can relieve some offensive pressure while mitigating Chandelure's Ghost- and Water-type weakness. Chandelure's weakness to Stealth Rock is a huge detriment to its wallbreaking ability. As a result, Rapid Spin and Defog users increase Chandelure's longevity.</p>"

      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Chandelure to work around switches and common stall playstyles, including teams that utilize Pokemon such as Blissey. Calm Mind increases Chandelure's already high Special Attack, allowing it to 2HKO a large portion of the tier. Flamethrower is a reliable STAB move that appreciates the Calm Mind boosts. Shadow Ball is Chandelure's secondary STAB move and provides it with reasonable offensive coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs ensure that Chandelure can wallbreak as easily as possible, even taking care of Blissey at +6. 252 Speed EVs allow Chandelure to outspeed most slower wallbreakers, such as Machamp, Nidoqueen, and Mega Blastoise, as well as any neutral base 90 Speed Pokemon. The 4 Special Defense EVs are used for the rare-yet-effective Download Porygon-Z, which can interrupt a sweep with Dark Pulse. Hydreigon is still a common switch-in for Chandelure, so an alternative spread with 112 HP EVs taken from Special Attack ensures that Chandelure survives Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse after one Calm Mind, allowing Chandelure to secure a surprise KO if Hydreigon has taken prior damage. 112 HP EVs also prevent uninvested Florges's Moonblast from breaking Chandelure's Substitute. Flame Body can be used over Flash Fire to cripple physical attackers, and lets Chandelure beat Porygon2.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best to save Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure as a late-game win condition or as a setup sweeper against stall playstyles. Despite having less special power than the Choice Scarf set, Chandelure can still serve as an effective moderate wallbreaker against weakened balanced threats. Chandelure can be an effective spinblocker against Forretress, but it fears Tentacruel and Donphan for Scald and Earthquake, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Vaporeon can take on most bulky Water- and Ground-types that threaten to OHKO Chandelure due to its horrid bulk. Choice Scarf Hydreigon has almost perfect type synergy with Chandelure. Shaymin loves Blissey being gone and deals easily with bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that threaten Chandelure, and the two together put enormous pressure on Hydreigon. Chandelure also partners well with Protect users, which can scout out Choice-locked Fighting-, Normal-, and Fire-type moves that Chandelure can switch into. Choice Band Machamp and Life Orb Lucario are good partners to get past some of Chandelure's specially defensive checks, such as Umbreon and Blissey. Dark-types such as Umbreon can relieve some defensive pressure while mitigating Chandelure's Ghost- and Water-type weaknesses. Chandelure's weakness to Stealth Rock is a huge detriment to its wallbreaking ability. As a result, Rapid Spin and Defog users increase Chandelure's longevity. Lastly, Florges, similarly to Umbreon, can take pressure off Chandelure when facing Hydreigon.</p>"

  "Haxorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Haxorus's massive Attack stat and its access to great setup moves, Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, make it a significant threat in UU. Its Speed, while only average for an offensive Pokemon, makes it the fastest user of Dragon Dance in the tier, notably allowing it to outspeed Mega Aerodactyl after a boost. Haxorus has great coverage to complement its STAB moves: Mold Breaker Earthquake and Poison Jab hit every Steel- and Fairy-type for major damage. However, Haxorus is rather reliant on Outrage to do significant damage to Pokemon such as Alomomola, Porygon2, and Milotic, making it easier to revenge kill. Additionally, Haxorus's mediocre bulk makes it difficult to set up, and as a wallbreaker, competitors such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Tyrantrum bring more defensively to the table through their superior typing, bulk, and abilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Haxorus can run a Choice Scarf set, but it would rather use its monstrous power to wallbreak or sweep after a Dragon Dance. Hydreigon is usually the superior option with its access to U-turn and ability to use its most powerful move without locking in. Dual Chop is an option over Dragon Claw on any Haxorus set, as it breaks through Focus Sashes, Sturdy, and Substitutes; however, it has a chance to miss, which can be crucial. Yache Berry can help Haxorus avoid being revenge killed by Mamoswine and can help it set up easily against other Pokemon such as Mega Swampert. Finally, Mental Herb is a gimmicky but possibly effective option on Dragon Dance Haxorus that can negate Whimsicott's attempt to Encore it. Mental Herb also negates Taunt from Pokemon such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Forretress</strong>: Forretress is the hardest counter to Haxorus available; Gyro Ball 2HKOs Haxorus after a Dragon Dance while Forretress avoids the 2HKO from +1 Earthquake. Forretress will lose one-on-one to Swords Dance Haxorus, but it can Volt Switch out to a revenge killer while retaining about half of its health.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Most relevant Choice Scarf users, with the exception of Rotom-C and Heracross, outspeed Haxorus even after a Dragon Dance. Mienshao and Hydreigon can outright OHKO Haxorus, while Infernape needs some prior damage. Mamoswine's Ice Shard, Entei's Extreme Speed, Choice Band Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, and Mega Absol's Sucker Punch can all revenge kill a weakened Haxorus.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: While no Fairy-type can stomach a boosted Poison Jab or Iron Tail, they can take advantage of a Haxorus forced to lock into Outrage to safely revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types with Ice Beam</strong>: Bulky Water-types that run Ice-type coverage, such as Suicune, can 2HKO Haxorus that attempt to set up safely with a Lum Berry.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance raises Haxorus's Speed and Attack stats by one stage, making it a deadly sweeper. Outrage hits relatively hard but confuses Haxorus after two to three turns and locks Haxorus into it during that period. Dragon Claw doesn't have the flaws Outrage does but is lacking in the damage department. Earthquake is the most important coverage move for Haxorus, being able to hit anything that resists Haxorus's STAB type for at least neutral damage. Poison Jab can be used over Taunt as an alternate coverage move to hit Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Whimsicott super effectively. Taunt is an option, but Haxorus would much rather have the coverage to hit the common Fairy-types of the tier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives Haxorus a nice damage boost at the cost of 10% HP each time it uses an attacking move. Lum Berry gets rid of status only once per match; it is also a good option when using Outrage, removing the confusion that the move causes. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are being used to maximize Haxorus's sweeping potential. A Jolly nature allows Haxorus to outspeed positive-natured base 85s, whereas an Adamant nature gives Haxorus a 10% damage increase while still allowing it to outspeed Mega Aerodactyl after a Dragon Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Haxorus set should be sent in during mid- or late-game to sweep or weaken the opposing team. Haxorus should set up on Pokemon that can't OHKO it, don't have phazing moves, or are forced out by it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Haxorus set aims to sweep or clean mid- to late-game; therefore, wallbreakers make for excellent partners, such as Choice Band Conkeldurr and Choice Band Entei. Physically defensive Steel-types usually stop Haxorus from sweeping unless they're weakened, which makes Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-types good partners. Examples of them are Nidoking, Heracross, and Entei, respectively. Shaymin is an amazing partner to this Haxorus set, as it can wallbreak as well as use Healing Wish to allow Haxorus more than one chance to sweep the opposing team.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Haxorus's Choice Band Outrage is extremely powerful, 2HKOing Suicune and Porygon2 without prior damage even with a Jolly nature. Earthquake allows Haxorus to hit Steel-types such as Doublade and Mega Aggron on the switch, 2HKOing them easily. Iron Tail provides powerful super effective coverage against Fairy-types, even OHKOing defensive Sylveon after Stealth Rock. Poison Jab can be used instead for its accuracy, but doesn't OHKO defensive Sylveon. Dragon Claw is a safe STAB move to use when locking into Outrage is unwanted. Superpower is an interesting option that lets Haxorus KO certain targets such as Krookodile without having to lock into Outrage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Haxorus's Speed and Attack EVs are maximized to augment its offensive capabilities. Choice Band is the item for the set, as it allows Haxorus to be an amazing wallbreaker, nailing 2HKOs and OHKOs on a majority of the tier's premier walls such as Suicune and Florges. A Jolly nature is preferred in order to outspeed as many threats as possible, such as Krookodile, Roserade, and Nidoking; an Adamant nature doesn't help Haxorus acquire too many useful KOs. Mold Breaker is the chosen ability as it provides the most use out of all three choices, nullifying defensive abilities such as Levitate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This particular Haxorus set is most effective during the mid-game, when it can start to break down opposing walls or significantly dent the opposing team. Haxorus shouldn't be locked into Outrage if opposing Fairy- or Steel-types are still active on the opposing team, unless it's more beneficial to weaken a different predicted target.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shaymin is an amazing teammate, as it not only forms a good wallbreaking core with Haxorus but also has access to Healing Wish, which allows Haxorus to have another chance at wallbreaking should it be weakened at some point during the game. Sharpedo, Mega Beedrill, and Swords Dance Lucario are examples of cleaners that highly appreciate the wallbreaking capabilities that Haxorus possesses. Haxorus appreciates entry hazard support from offensive teammates such as Krookodile and Nidoqueen. An excellent partner for Choice Band Haxorus is Choice Scarf Heracross, as Haxorus lures in most of its defensive checks, making it easier for Heracross to clean. Speed control support, such as Stun Spore and Tailwind, really helps this Haxorus set fare well against more offensive teams; therefore, Tornadus and Whimsicott are amazing teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Haxorus to break through more defensively orientated teams by boosting its Attack stat by two stages. Outrage pairs well with Swords Dance due to its amazing damage output coupled with a STAB boost. Given that Outrage users such as Haxorus commonly lure in Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon, super effective coverage against them is most appreciated in the last two slots, thus making Earthquake and Poison Jab perfect fits.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Haxorus's offensive capabilities. Lum Berry allows Haxorus to shrug off status from Pokemon such as Alomomola and Porygon2 one time. A Life Orb, on the other hand, gives Haxorus a significant boost, but at the cost of 1/10 of its HP with each hit. A Jolly nature is crucial for outspeeding positive-natured base 85s. Meanwhile, an Adamant nature can be used for more power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This particular set is most effective against defensively oriented teams and is best set up when no faster threats are left. This set should also be sent in mid-game. Swords Dance Haxorus should be the primary win condition against stall teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A set such as this is always paired best with cleaners, as they can usually sweep after Haxorus does its job; as such, Mega Sharpedo, Mega Sceptile, and Choice Scarf Mienshao make the best of partners. Lunar Dance and Healing Wish are both moves that can remove status and heal the recipient to full, giving Haxorus another chance to wear down walls. Therefore, Lunar Dance and Healing Wish users, such as Cresselia and Shaymin, respectively, make for excellent teammates.</p>"

      "Double Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Haxorus to break through more defensively oriented teams by boosting its Attack stat by two stages. Dragon Dance, on the other hand, boosts Haxorus's Speed and Attack stats at the same time, allowing it to beat more offensive teams. Dragon Claw is a reliable STAB move, although its damage output can be underwhelming at times. Outrage, on the other hand, hits hard but has the drawback of locking Haxorus into it, leaving it open to being revenge killed. Earthquake is a great coverage move that allows Haxorus to hit the Steel- and Fairy-types that can take its Dragon-type moves with ease; it also allows Haxorus to hit Levitate Pokemon such as Bronzong thanks to Mold Breaker.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Haxorus to sweep as efficiently as possible. Mold Breaker is the chosen ability, as it has the most use out of all three choices, nullifying defensive abilities such as Mega Aggron's Filter and Rotom-H's Levitate. A Lum Berry gives Haxorus a means of setting up more easily. A Jolly nature allows Haxorus to outspeed many threats, such as Krookodile and Kyurem. An Adamant nature can also be used, should the extra power be appealing.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Haxorus should be sent in during the mid- and late-game against more offensive teams to have a good chance of cleaning up. Against more defensive teams, however, it should be sent in from the get-go or during the mid-game to wear down the opposing team for another Pokemon to clean after it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Haxorus appreciates entry hazard support, particularly Spikes support, making Froslass and Roserade good teammates. Teammates such as Swords Dance Heracross and Choice Band Conkeldurr can lure in and damage or KO Sylveon, Florges, and Whimsicott in order to make Haxorus's sweep easier. On the other hand, teammates such as Choice Scarf Mienshao may appreciate Haxorus weakening defensive Fairy-types and bulky Pokemon with +2 attacks. Pivot support from teammates such as Crobat can help Haxorus switch in safely and start to boost. Memento and dual screen support can provide easy setup opportunities as well.</p>"

  "Accelgor": {
    "overview": "<p>Accelgor is a great Spikes lead that can efficiently accomplish a couple of jobs for its team, including setting up Spikes, taking out Pokemon with Final Gambit, or encoring Pokemon into setup or status moves. It also is able to outspeed the entire metagame bar Mega Aerodactyl, thus guaranteeing entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field. Accelgor also has access to a plethora of support moves, including Spikes, Final Gambit, Rain Dance, and Encore. Accelgor, unlike Froslass, is not hindered by Magic Bounce, as it can outspeed and OHKO Espeon and Xatu, as well as Mega Absol, whose Sucker Punch it can endure. Accelgor can also hit relatively hard with its base 100 Special Attack; however, it is extremely frail and has trouble surviving neutral and even resisted hits. Accelgor has a hard time shining in the UU metagame, as Froslass partially outclasses it as a Spikes lead due to the fact that it is immune to Rapid Spin, has a better ability in Cursed Body, and has a wider supportive movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Accelgor can successfully run an offensive set with Life Orb or Choice Specs because of its high Speed and Special Attack; however, this set is outclassed by Yanmega because Yanmega is faster after a speed boost and has more coverage options as well. Accelgor can also make use of Yawn, as it can force switches and set up even more layers of Spikes if it puts the foe to sleep. Accelgor can run U-turn as well to become an offensive pivot, but this is usually better done by many other Pokemon, such as Darmanitan and Crobat. Accelgor can rely on its high Speed to use Me First, which can provide some surprise KOs on Draco Meteor users and other Pokemon that are weak to their own STAB moves, such as Ghost-types. Hidden Power Fire can be run to take down lead Forretress and other leads that are weak to it, such as Froslass. Accelgor can run a niche rain setter set relatively well, as it is the most viable Spikes lead for rain teams. This rain-based set also makes use of Hydration, which cures Accelgor of status conditions. This set uses Spikes, Rain Dance, Bug Buzz, and either Focus Blast or Encore, with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe, a Timid nature, and Damp Rock. While this set is mostly outclassed by Tornadus, Tornadus can't set up Spikes, which gives Accelgor a reason to be used over it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Forretress</strong>: Forretress can wall Accelgor pretty well and remove its Spikes; however, it must be wary of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Accelgor may have high Speed, but it always moves after priority moves, many of which deal lots of damage to it due to its low Defense. This is can be critical when Accelgor is down to its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Hit Moves</strong>: Moves such as Tail Slap, Icicle Spear, and especially Rock Blast can break Accelgor's Focus Sash and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Accelgor is not immune to Rapid Spin like Froslass is and cannot prevent Defoggers from removing its Spikes. However, all entry hazard removers must be wary of Final Gambit.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile, Mienshao, and Heracross can be brought in from pivoting moves and allow Accelgor to only set up one layer of Spikes. This is especially true for Choice Scarf revenge killers, as a teammate's Volt Switch or U-turn can bring them in to KO Accelgor.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is the only reason to use Accelgor as a lead or an occasional mid-game entry hazard stacker. Encore deters setup sweepers from setting up on Accelgor and opposing leads from setting up their own entry hazards or even paralyzing it. Final Gambit allows Accelgor to take out the opposing spinner before it removes its Spikes. Accelgor can also use Final Gambit after it has done its job, weakening many Pokemon thanks to its relatively high base 80 HP. Focus Blast can be used instead if stronger coverage against Steel- and Rock-types is needed, but Final Gambit is usually more useful to take out spinners and defoggers that could get rid of the spikes Accelgor has laid down or Pokemon that are threatening to your team. If Accelgor runs Focus Blast, an alternative EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe is highly recommended so that it can hit much harder. Lastly, Bug Buzz is Accelgor's hardest-hitting STAB move and can take down many of its counters, such as Espeon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature make Accelgor as fast as possible, allowing it to Speed tie with Mega Sceptile and Mega Beedrill and outspeed up to base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure, Mamoswine, and Nidoqueen. Maximum HP investment is needed to deal as much damage as possible with Final Gambit, as it can take out Pokemon such as Forretress, which is a popular counter to Accelgor. It also allows Accelgor to tank some resisted hits and set up more layers of Spikes. Focus Sash allows Accelgor to survive a hit and set up at least two layer of Spikes or 2HKO the foe. Unburden doubles Accelgor's Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire metagame and possibly OHKO Choice Scarf users that could have outsped it before, such as Krookodile, Mienshao, and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Accelgor should mostly be used on offensive teams, specifically hazard stacking or hyper offense teams. It is best used as a Spikes lead, and it matches up well against other common leads such as Krookodile and Espeon. Accelgor should be used to set up as many layers of Spikes as possible, and then it dish out damage with Final Gambit, Focus Blast, or Bug Buzz. Accelgor is also used well mid-game as an entry hazard stacker and offensive threat that can cause many switches and gain momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Accelgor is best used with spinblockers such as Doublade, Jellicent, and Chandelure, as, unlike Froslass, it is not immune to Rapid Spin; Chandelure in particular complements Accelgor very well, as it is immune to Fire, can wallbreak better with Spikes on the field, and can take out many of Accelgor's counters, such as Forretress and Defoggers such as Crobat. Being fast, having offensive presence, and being able to set up entry hazards, Accelgor can help many late-game sweepers such as Mega Sceptile, Mega Sharpedo, Slurpuff, and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Setters of Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes such as Krookodile, Swampert, Druddigon, Empoleon, Dragalge, and Tentacruel also pair well with Accelgor to accumulate multiple entry hazards on the opposing side of the field to wear down Pokemon when they switch in. Accelgor works well with phazers that can force switches and rack up entry hazard damage such as Swampert, Suicune, Dragalge, Mega Steelix, Mega Aggron, and Rhyperior. Dragalge has particularly great defensive synergy with Accelgor and can set up Toxic Spikes, wallbreak effectively, and phaze foes with Dragon Tail. Lastly, other wallbreakers such as Hydreigon, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, Heracross, Infernape, and Cobalion also appreciate entry hazards and can break down teams well with Accelgor's support.</p>"

  "Mienshao": {
    "overview": "<p>No other Fighting-type in UU can boast the combination of Speed and power that Mienshao possesses. Its good base 105 Speed lets it outrun notable threats like Hydreigon and Celebi, while its excellent base 125 Attack lets it hit extremely hard. Its movepool is good too, with its STAB High Jump Kick backed up by good coverage options in Knock Off, U-turn, Poison Jab and Stone Edge. It also has access to two excellent abilities in Regenerator and Reckless. Regenerator lets it fire off powerful attacks throughout the match, while Reckless gives its STAB High Jump Kick incredible power.</p> <p>However, while Mienshao can dish out the damage it certainly can't take it. Low 65/60/60 defenses mean that just about any reasonably strong neutral move will 2HKO, which in turn makes it difficult to get Mienshao in safely. High Jump Kick may well be very powerful, but an untimely miss could mean a premature end to Mienshao. It also faces stiff competition from other Fighting-types like Lucario, Toxicroak, Cobalion and Conkeldurr, who can offer secondary STABs, higher speed or better bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Swords Dance and 3 attack moves can be used to make Mienshao a fearsome wallbreaker; however, setting up is quite difficult and it doesn't need a boost to threaten the foe. Jump Kick and Drain Punch are decent secondary STAB moves, which can be used to alleviate Mienshao's reliance on High Jump Kick. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge on any set, but it doesn't guarantee the OHKO against Crobat after Stealth Rock damage. Aerial Ace can be used to hit Chesnaught and Heracross harder than any of Mienshao's other moves. Bulk Up and Calm Mind can be used on the Substitute set, but even with those moves it won't be able to set up and pass a Substitute without being forced out.</p> <p>Choice Band can be used to allow Mienshao to 2HKO virtually the entire tier. However, that item does not go well with High Jump Kick's drawbacks. Black Belt can also be used to bluff a Choice Scarf and potentially garner a free Substitute or Swords Dance boost as a result; however, without a Life Orb Mienshao loses the guaranteed OHKO on Crobat after Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Mienshao struggles to 2HKO Pokemon such as Suicune, Chesnaught, and physically defensive Arcanine without Life Orb. However, if it is running that item, they can be beaten after some previous damage.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon are immune to High Jump Kick and their mere presence on the opposing team is a threat to Mienshao. Knock Off helps against most of them, but Spiritomb doesn't fear any move and Doublade is capable of surviving two Life Orb-boosted hits after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Poison-type Pokemon</strong>: Poison-types resist High Jump Kick and U-turn, while Knock Off does neutral damage to most of them. Defensive Nidoqueen isn't 3HKOed by any combination of Mienshao's moves. Crobat 4x resists Fighting and Bug, and it only fears Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon</strong>: Fairies resist Mienshao's STAB moves and U-turn, and they only fear Poison Jab. Granbull deserves a special mention because it is not 2HKOed by Poison Jab thanks to Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mienshao's subpar bulk means that most Pokemon faster than it, such as Choice Scarf Infernape, can easily revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Protect and Spiky Shield</strong>: Protect and Spiky Shield prevent Mienshao from using High Jump Kick. Life Orb sets can play around them with good predictions, but the Choice Scarf set completely loses momentum.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Mienshao's main method of doing damage. When combined with Reckless, it is capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Haxorus, and Mega Aerodactyl most of the time. U-turn is used to gain momentum and does chip damage to Pokemon trying to stop Mienshao, especially Psychic-types such as Cresselia. Knock Off hits Ghost-type Pokemon for good damage, making them think twice before trying to switch into a predicted High Jump Kick, and additionally, it cripples Pokemon that rely on their items. Stone Edge is exclusively for Crobat, as it has a chance of OHKOing after Stealth Rock damage, which is important because Crobat is one of the most common switch-ins to Mienshao. Poison Jab can be used over Stone Edge to hit Fairy-types, particularly Sylveon and Whimsicott, but most of them avoid the 2HKO and getting locked into a Poison-type move puts Mienshao in a bad spot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize Mienshao's Speed and power. The 4 Special Defense EVs prevent Pokemon with Download from getting a Special Attack boost. A Jolly nature is needed to outspeed other Choice Scarf users, such as Krookodile, Darmanitan, and Hydreigon. Reckless makes High Jump Kick significantly stronger, turning lots of 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ghost-type Pokemon stop Mienshao from using High Jump Kick freely, so their mere presence on the opponent's team is threatening. For that reason, using Knock Off and U-turn early on is advised. Choice Scarf Mienshao is stronger than most Choice Scarf users, but it struggles to break through dedicated physical walls such as Chesnaught, so it has to be used mainly as a revenge killer or as a late-game cleaner. Mienshao's subpar bulk really limits its ability to switch in directly into most Pokemon and it's threatened by anything it can't OHKO, so be aware of its limitations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mienshao appreciates entry hazard support, because it helps wear down the opponent's team. Krookodile works well as a Stealth Rock setter because it traps Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Mienshao. Roserade is great as a Spikes setter because it can use Water- and Fairy-types to set up. Strong special attackers, such as Choice Specs Chandelure and Life Orb Hydreigon, are good partners because they can deal with physical walls switching into Mienshao's U-turn. Strong Volt Switch users, such as Mega Ampharos and Choice Specs Rotom-H, are great teammates, as not only do they threaten physical walls, but they can also form a VoltTurn core with Mienshao. Lastly, Mienshao greatly appreciates Pursuit support to remove or wear down Ghost- and Psychic-types; the previously mentioned Krookodile, Mega Absol, and Mega Aerodactyl are examples of Pokemon that can do this.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is Mienshao's strongest STAB move, and it 2HKOes everything that doesn't resist it or isn't a dedicated physical wall. Knock Off gives Mienshao great neutral coverage and is Mienshao's strongest move against Ghost- and Psychic-types; it also cripples Pokemon that rely on their items. U-turn is great to keep momentum and hits Psychic-type Pokemon decently hard. Poison Jab hits Fairy-type Pokemon, allowing Mienshao to OHKO Whimsicott, as well as 2HKO Florges and Aromatisse. Stone Edge hits Crobat, which otherwise completely walls this set. Fake Out is a usable priority move, but it's mostly used for free damage. Hidden Power Ice can be used to 2HKO Gligar, which otherwise walls this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used to take advantage of Mienshao's best stats. The 4 leftover EVs don't have much use, so they are dumped into Special Defense to not give a Special Attack boost to the uncommon Choice Scarf Download Porygon-Z. A Jolly nature is needed to outspeed threatening Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Shaymin, Haxorus, and Mega Glalie. Gligar is still 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice even with a Jolly nature. This set needs Life Orb to boost Mienshao's power, and unlike a Choice Band, this item gives Mienshao the ability to fully take advantage of its movepool. Regenerator is the preferred ability because it makes using High Jump Kick less risky, helps with Life Orb recoil, and works amazingly well with U-turn. Reckless is an option because it allows Mienshao to 2HKO everything in the tier that doesn't resist its moves, including bulky physical walls such as Chesnaught and Suicune, but it makes Mienshao significantly easier to wear down and turns High Jump Kick into a high-risk move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mienshao shouldn't mindlessly use High Jump Kick as long as there's a Ghost-type Pokemon on the opposite team, but it can play around most of them thanks to its Speed, coverage moves, and Regenerator. Without Reckless, Mienshao will struggle with breaking through healthy physically defensive walls, but they can be worn down with the combination of U-turn and Knock Off. Mienshao's poor bulk means it has problems directly switching into attacks, but with Regenerator it's possible to switch into relatively weak attacks to threaten the foe without being worn down too much.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is recommended because it helps Mienshao wear down its counters and checks. Both Krookodile and Roserade can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, respectively, and have good offensive synergy with Mienshao. Crobat gives this set issues, so using a Pokemon that deals with it, such as Mega Aerodactyl, is advised. Pokemon that can take advantage of Mienshao using U-turn against some of its counters are good partners, for example Shaymin and Chandelure. Volt Switch users, such as Mega Ampharos and Rotom-H, also work well with Mienshao's ability to gain momentum with U-turn. Mienshao's ability to wear down physical walls helps Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Haxorus and Mega Absol break through the opponent's team, making them great teammates.</p>"

  "Druddigon": {
    "overview": "<p>While it is generally outclassed by other Dragons such as Haxorus and Goodra, Druddigon has a niche in UU as a Dragon-type Stealth Rock setter, bringing all the resistances of a Dragon-type while having the ability to support its team with entry hazards. Tyrantrum is another Pokemon in UU capable of performing this role, but it is better off attacking or sweeping in most cases. Druddigon also benefits from its good coverage, most notably a powerful Gunk Shot to surprise Fairy-types, particularly alongside a Roseli Berry, along with a good priority move in Sucker Punch. A solid mix of bulk, power, and support moves such as Glare also make it worth using. However, Druddigon's poor Speed, lack of recovery, and merely average bulk really hinder it and make it easy to wear down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Druddigon can use a defensive set with Rough Skin to check physical attackers such as Mega Beedrill, Darmanitan, and Cobalion. Choice Band can be used to wallbreak, but Druddigon is largely outclassed by Haxorus and Tyrantrum in this role, as they are even stronger and are not held back by terrible Speed. Assault Vest is an option to check a large portion of special attackers, but without recovery or Stealth Rock, it's not very useful.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Whimsicott, Gardevoir, and Florges can give Druddigon trouble, but they're all vulnerable to Gunk Shot and, in Whimsicott's case, Fire Punch. Roseli Berry can help Druddigon tank Moonblast from these threats as well.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Aggron, Cobalion, and Doublade can switch into most of Druddigon's attacks but, at least in Doublade's and Cobalion's cases, take significant damage from Fire Punch and Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Cobalion, Mandibuzz, and Krookodile can use Taunt to prevent Druddigon from using Glare or Stealth Rock temporarily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Claw provides Druddigon with a consistent STAB move that hits neutral targets for good damage. Fire Punch has near-perfect coverage with Dragon Claw, taking advantage of Sheer Force and beating Pokemon like Forretress, Cobalion, and Whimsicott. Earthquake is an alternative for beating Steel-types, particularly Empoleon, and takes advantage of Mold Breaker to ignore Levitate from Bronzong and Rotom-H as well as Filter and Solid Rock from Mega Aggron and Rhyperior. Gunk Shot hits Fairies such as Florges, Aromatisse and Whimsicott hard, especially with the boost from Sheer Force. Sucker Punch can also be used as a moderately strong priority move that helps to compensate for Druddigon's low Speed and can be used to deal some damage right before Druddigon faints or to pick off a weakened threat. Glare paralyzes foes, slowing them down and potentially giving Druddigon and its teammates free turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread maximizes Druddigon's bulk and power, and 20 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Mega Aggron. An alternative EV spread of 156 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Spe can be used to outspeed Empoleon and Dragalge, which is especially good if using Earthquake. Sheer Force should be used when running Fire Punch or Gunk Shot, while Mold Breaker allows Druddigon to bypass Magic Bounce from Espeon and Mega Absol when using Stealth Rock and Levitate when using Earthquake. Roseli Berry thwarts Fairy-types and is really useful when running Gunk Shot to tank a hit and retaliate hard. Leftovers provides passive recovery, granting Druddigon more longevity. Life Orb is best used with Sheer Force, notably allowing Druddigon to 2HKO Doublade with Fire Punch or Earthquake, as well as OHKO Aromatisse with Gunk Shot, specially defensive Empoleon with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage, and Forretress with Fire Punch if its Sturdy is broken or if it has Overcoat. Life Orb also guarantees the OHKO on Mega Beedrill with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Druddigon is best used on teams that need a Stealth Rock setter and appreciate the resistances of a Dragon-type. This set is generally good to use as a lead depending on the team matchup. Getting Stealth Rock up as early as possible is good for chipping away at your opponent's team. Druddigon can also set up Stealth Rock on common offensive threats that it checks such as Rotom-C, Rotom-H, Darmanitan, Entei, and Doublade. When running Sucker Punch, make sure that Druddigon stays healthy for the late-game in case to needs to revenge kill or check a dangerous sweeper. When using Roseli Berry, do not switch into Fairy-type moves with it; rather, it should be used to tank a Fairy-type move and retaliate with Gunk Shot. With Glare, Druddigon can act as a good pivot and provide paralysis support for the team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Doublade, Entei, Mega Beedrill, Crobat, Mega Aggron and Chandelure complement Druddigon well by taking on Fairies if it isn't running Roseli Berry + Gunk Shot to lure and KO them. Poison Jab on Mienshao as well as Iron Tail on fellow Dragons and Mega Absol make for good lures to Fairies as well. Bulky Steel- and Fairy-types such as Doublade and Florges provide a good defensive backbone for Druddigon as well thanks to their resistances to Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type moves. Sweepers such as Slurpuff and Feraligatr appreciate having Whimsicott, Forretress, and Doublade lured and KOed, as well as the chip damage from Stealth Rock. Fighting- and Dark-types pair well with Gunk Shot Druddigon to benefit from its ability to lure and eliminate Fairies.</p>"

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>Mandibuzz offers a unique set of defensive traits, most notably a strong typing, respectable stats in those areas, and reliable recovery in Roost. This combination allows it to fare well against many top threats like Celebi, Krookodile, Gyarados, and Mega Sceptile. It also has access to some useful utility moves in Defog, Foul Play, U-turn, and Knock Off. These factors combine to make Mandibuzz one of the better defensive pivots the tier has to offer. However, largely due to its reliance on Foul Play to do meaningful damage, Mandibuzz finds itself much worse off against bulky Pokemon like Bulk Up Conkeldurr and Florges. Additionally, status moves can severely cripple its longevity and general defensive uses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic lets Mandibuzz cripple Swampert, Cresselia, and Slowking, but it is often difficult to fit over other moves. Teammates can often carry this move to cripple the intended targets and aid Mandibuzz in dealing with them one-on-one. Taunt is an option alongside Toxic to more effectively deal with bulky foes, but it suffers heavily from the presence of threatening Fighting-types and bulky Fairy-type clerics.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Florges and Sylveon fear nothing from Mandibuzz's attacks and take advantage of it to perform their roles.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Conkeldurr and Cobalion take negligible damage from Mandibuzz's attacks, letting them throw out powerful attacks or start setting up with their respective moves.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: The Attack drop from burns severely cripples Mandibuzz's ability to check foes like Gyarados and Celebi, and both burns and poisons negate its passive recovery and force it to use Roost more often than it would prefer.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Suicune, Snorlax, Reuniclus, and Cresselia shrug off any of Mandibuzz's attacks and set up in front of it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Foul Play is Mandibuzz's main Dark-type STAB move, allowing it to reliably check Gyarados and Mega Swampert while dealing solid chunks to physical threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Krookodile, and Swords Dance Cobalion when needed. Roost keeps Mandibuzz healthy enough to sponge hits from foes like Celebi, Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Gyarados. Defog removes all entry hazards, most notably letting Mandibuzz itself switch more comfortably into Dazzling Gleam Celebi and Hydreigon. U-turn allows Mandibuzz to get teammates such as Nidoqueen, Roserade, and Mega Aerodactyl into favorable positions to fulfill their respective roles. Alternatively, Knock Off can remove the Leftovers of bulky Pokemon like Swampert, Florges, and Empoleon or cripple item-reliant foes like Nidoqueen and Gligar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment lets Mandibuzz match up with attackers like Celebi, Mega Sceptile, Mega Blastoise, and Hydreigon as well as possible. Leftovers provides Mandibuzz with passive recovery, helping to keep it healthy enough to handle the threats it is meant to. Overcoat most notably lets Mandibuzz counter Roserade, providing it with an immunity to Sleep Powder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot Mandibuzz into Pokemon it is meant to handle such as Celebi, Krookodile, Gyarados, and Roserade. Use these favorable positions to deal damage back with Foul Play, remove entry hazards with Defog, or get off a slow U-turn to get a teammate into a good spot. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, Defog is often most useful in keeping Mandibuzz itself healthy, letting it continually come in against the aforementioned threats. The best course of action following a switch into a full health Celebi as it uses Nasty Plot is often to slow U-turn out into a fast teammate that can easily pick off a weakened Celebi. While it counters any non-Dazzling Gleam variant, Mandibuzz is 2HKOed if they do have it, making U-turn the superior play to the slightly stronger alternative in Foul Play. Generally, burns and poisons should be avoided, as they can weaken its attacks or limit effectiveness defensively, but at times they are necessary to stomach. Examples include switching into Roserade's Sludge Bomb or attempting to get off a slow U-turn after Suicune's Scald. Knock Off is useful in removing the Leftovers of troublesome walls or when in the face of Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Gligar that depend on their items to be effective. If paired with Florges, Mandibuzz can often be the preferred switch-in to special attackers like Hydreigon and Mega Sceptile, as it can easily take their attacks and gain momentum with U-turn, whereas Florges may be forced to use Synthesis following Hydreigon's Flash Cannon or Mega Sceptile's Leaf Storm.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mandibuzz can fit on a variety of playstyles ranging from bulky offense to stall due to its defensive uses and general utility. If carrying U-turn, it is essential that Mandibuzz have a partner such as Pursuit Mega Aerodactyl or U-turn Infernape that can pick off a weakened Celebi, as that is often a common scenario in dealing with it. Poison-types like Nidoqueen and Roserade heavily appreciate the positioning against Fairy-types that Mandibuzz can provide via U-turn. The two can proceed to set entry hazards and throw out their powerful attacks. Florges and Colbur Berry Psychic Slowking share fantastic defensive synergy with Mandibuzz, checking its main bane in Bulk Up Conkeldurr. Additionally, Florges gives cleric support and can take pressure off of Mandibuzz in handling foes like Hydreigon, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Blastoise. Slowking fares well against threats like Cobalion, Entei, and Mega Aerodactyl. In return, Mandibuzz deals with Pokemon like Celebi, Roserade, and Krookodile that can potentially muscle past these partners. Suicune makes for a solid partner, checking Mega Aerodactyl and absorbing status moves aimed at Mandibuzz, while Mandibuzz can handle some of Suicune's most prominent answers in Mega Sceptile, Celebi, and Roserade. Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Doublade pair nicely with Mandibuzz, covering its main weakness in Fairy and appreciating the easy positioning it provides against them to perform their roles. The latter two can viably run Toxic alongside Mandibuzz to cripple Swampert and Cresselia, which can often be difficult for it to deal with despite their initially poor damage output against it.</p>"

  "Durant": {
    "overview": "<p>With an exceptional Speed tier, Durant is able to outrun key threats such as Mienshao and Cobalion while also Speed tying with Heliolisk. Having access to Hustle, Durant's already solid Attack is buffed massively, giving it grand wallbreaking potential. Durant also has access to Hone Claws, which not only raises its already high Attack, but raises the accuracy of its moves, removing the appalling downside of Hustle. This is backed up with its fantastic typing not only offensively but also defensively, as Durant's typing has only one weakness, one immunity, and many resistances. However, Durant's decent physical bulk and typing is let down by a very poor HP stat and pitiful special bulk, meaning that even resisted hits will do a hefty chunk to it. Durant's typing also leaves it horribly weak to Fire-type attacks, which are quite common on Pokemon such as Entei and Infernape. Hustle also means that the accuracy of all of Durant's attacks will be lowered to 80% at best without a Hone Claws boost, which means any one of its attacks could miss at a crucial moment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave is an option to cripple opposing Pokemon such as Chandelure and Cobalion that attempt to switch in, but Durant has a hard time fitting it onto a moveslot. Wide Lens can be used to rid Durant of Hustle's accuracy drop. Agility boosts Durant's Speed to massive levels, allowing it to outspeed the entire metagame and take many faster Pokemon by surprise. Substitute can be used, allowing Durant to dodge possible status conditions while sacrificing a slight amount of Durant's HP. Crunch can surprise Doublade and Jellicent switch-ins and do a large amount of damage to both. Choice Scarf can be used to boost Durant's Speed; however, it doesn't hit as hard as it needs to on the majority of its targets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Because of Durant's low Special Defense, it is extremely susceptible to special attacks from powerful special attackers such as Heliolisk, Hydreigon, and Chandelure and even resisted hits can deal a lot of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Alomomola, and Tentacruel can all take a hit from Durant except a Thunder Fang and proceed to use Scald and try to burn it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Absol and Choice Scarf Rotom-C can easily revenge kill Durant. When it is weakened, Choice Scarf Mienshao and Mega Aerodactyl can KO it easily, though they cannot safely switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Moves</strong>: Due to Durant's 4x weakness to Fire, many Pokemon that carry Fire-type moves can threaten it. Fire-types such as Infernape, Entei, Darmanitan, and Chandelure can threaten Durant with their super effective Fire-type STAB moves. Pokemon that carry Fire-type coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire Mega Sceptile are also something players should be aware of.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head hits astonishingly hard due to its decent Base Power and the boosts provided by Hustle and Life Orb or Choice Band. X-Scissor hits common Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Krookodile without having to resort to the stat-lowering Superpower. Rock Slide can hit Flying- and Fire-types such as Mandibuzz and Chandelure on the predicted switch, although staying in on any of these is not recommended. Thunder Fang is another option to hit bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Alomomola for acceptable damage. Superpower hits Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Forretress, as well as Snorlax, although the stat decrease will most likely cause Durant to switch out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hustle boosts Durant's Attack to tremendous levels at the cost of slight accuracy loss, as Swarm and Truant range from being extremely situational to downright detrimental. 252 Attack EVs allow Durant to hit as hard as possible with its attacks, while a Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed a good portion of the UU metagame and Speed tie with non-Choice Scarf Heliolisk. Life Orb gives Durant more power to its attacks with slight recoil each turn, but it allows Durant to have the freedom of switching between its moves. Choice Band removes the recoil effect and gives more wallbreaking power than Life Orb; however, Durant is unable to switch moves while Choice Band is equipped, meaning it can be taken advantage of easier.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Durant's decent physical bulk and exceptional typing to its advantages, as, even with its mediocre HP stat, it is able to safely check Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill, Florges, Aromatisse, and Cresselia. However, it's generally difficult to switch Durant in to most offensive Pokemon, as they take a huge chunk out of its health, so, against offensive teams, it is safer to get a free switch from a teammate. Iron Head is a generally safe move to spam, as few Pokemon resist it and it hits incredibly hard. Be wary of Durant's low Special Defense, as common offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon can OHKO even with non-super effective moves after Stealth Rock damage. Don't be hasty by keeping Durant on the field when a defensive Pokemon such as Empoleon or Suicune is facing it, as risking a burn from Scald usually isn't worth the result, as status will leave Durant crippled for the remainder of the battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can switch into Fire-type attacks such as Arcanine, Entei, and Suicune can easily switch into moves that Durant would normally have to avoid. If Durant is not running Thunder Fang, Pokemon such as Rotom-C, Mega Sceptile, and Shaymin can deal with bulky Water-type Pokemon that Durant would do laughable damage to. Stealth Rock from Pokemon such as Rhyperior, which also shares decent type synergy, helps Durant wear down its checks easier, thanks to the small amount of chip damage the target will take from each switch in.</p>"

      "Hone Claws": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hone Claws boosts Durant's already decent Attack to substantial levels while also resolving the lower accuracy from its ability Hustle. Iron Head not only has a chance to flinch the target, but it also hits Rock-, Ice-, and Fairy-types for super effective damage. X-Scissor is Durant's secondary STAB attack, hitting Pokemon such as Krookodile and Hydreigon without having to resort to using the stat-detrimental Superpower. Superpower hits bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Cobalion while also hitting Snorlax for heavy damage, which would otherwise take little damage from Durant's other attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hustle is Durant's best ability, as, thanks to Hone Claws, Hustle gives Durant a large Attack boost while generally ignoring the accuracy drop thanks to the boosts. 252 Attack EVs allow Durant to deal as much damage as possible with its physical attacks, and a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Mienshao and Speed tie with Heliolisk. Thanks to Hone Claws boosting Durant's attack, an Adamant nature is not needed. Life Orb gives Durant extremely high power behind its attacks while inflicting slight recoil per turn; however, Lum Berry can be used for a one-time immunity to burn and paralysis.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Durant sets up Hone Claws best on Pokemon that cannot harm it easily, such as Mega Beedrill, Florges, Snorlax, and Escavalier; however, do not be risky by switching Durant into attacks, as even certain resisted attacks do large amounts of damage. Be aware that without a Hone Claws boost prior to attacking, each move has a dreadful 20% chance to miss due to Hustle, and that can cleanly stop a sweep and turn the battle around in the opponent's favor. Severely weaken Durant's checks and counters, as Durant has somewhat low bulk, being worn down extremely fast due to possible Life Orb and entry hazard damage, and, because it has no form of reliable recovery, it will most likely not get another attempt at sweeping the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Cobalion, and Krookodile give Durant chip damage on the opposing Pokemon as they try to switch in, giving it an easier time attempting to sweep. Pivots such as Mega Beedrill and Rotom-H can U-turn or Volt Switch into Durant, possibly giving it an opportunity to set up a Hone Claws. Pokemon that absorb Fire-type attacks such as Arcanine, Chandelure, and Tentacruel can easily take advantage of a possible Fire-type attack aimed at Durant. Dual screens support makes Durant much bulkier and gives it an easier time attempting to set up.</p>"

Hydreigon's typing gives it almost perfect neutral coverage with its STAB moves; the only type that resists both is Fairy. Defensively, Hydreigon's typing has some great resistances and, taking Levitate into consideration, two immunities. Hydreigon's movepool is simply fantastic, which makes it a really versatile threat. However, Hydreigon's weakness to Fighting- and Bug-type attacks, both of which are common in UnderUsed, and the fact its base 98 Speed isn't that great, make it hard for Hydreigon to deal with offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set, with moves such as Outrage, Superpower, Iron Tail, and U-turn, can be used to lure in and beat special walls, but it is too reliant on surprise factor and prediction. Substitute and Roost can be used on the same set to utilize Hydreigon's bulk and typing to set up, but it struggles to break through dedicated special walls. Hydreigon has some less effective coverage moves it can use instead of the ones suggested in the sets, such as Surf, Focus Blast, and Earth Power. It can boost its Attack and Special Attack with Work Up, but that usually is not worth the effort, because the boost isn't significant and Hydreigon isn't particularly hard to revenge kill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: No combination of Hydreigon's moves 2HKOes specially defensive Porygon2, and Ice Beam and Tri Attack allow Porygon2 to beat Taunt sets.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon resist both of Hydreigon's STAB moves, and Florges, Sylveon, and Aromatisse are bulky enough to not be threatened by Fire Blast. Only the wallbreaker set is able to threaten them if running Steel-type coverage. Iron Tail hits Florges significantly harder than Flash Cannon, but Flash Cannon is better against Aromatisse and Granbull, and the latter doesn't handle Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse or Fire Blast very well.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Vaporeon, Milotic, and Suicune can deal with wallbreaker and Choice Scarf sets. However, without Ice Beam, they all lose to Taunt Hydreigon. Empoleon is similar to the other bulky Water-types, but Superpower from the wallbreaker set can KO after using any other move to wear Empoleon down.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can OHKO Hydreigon, such as Infernape, can easily revenge kill it.

Dark Pulse allows Hydreigon to hit Steel-type Pokemon that resist Draco Meteor, especially Bronzong, for good damage and also has decent super effective coverage. Superpower allows Hydreigon to threaten Blissey, Empoleon, Snorlax, and Umbreon with a potential KO after hitting them with Draco Meteor. Fire Blast hits Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage, making it useful on sets without Dark Pulse, and also allows Hydreigon to hit bulky Grass-type Pokemon for massive damage without relying on Draco Meteor. Roost gives Hydreigon more longevity and helps it deal with Life Orb recoil. Iron Tail allows Hydreigon to 2HKO Florges and other less common Fairy-type Pokemon, which would easily wall this set. Flash Cannon can be used because it has 100% accuracy and hits Fairy-types not called Florges harder than Iron Tail; however, it won't 2HKO Florges without some prior damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The listed EVs maximize Hydreigon's Special Attack and Speed. A Hasty nature is needed to outspeed Pokemon such as Haxorus, Lucario, and Roserade and to not Speed tie with base 85 Speed Pokemon running a positive nature. 4 Attack EVs make Superpower and Iron Tail slightly stronger. If no physical move is being used, Timid is the preferred nature, and the 4 remaining EVs should be put in Special Defense to prevent Download users from getting a Special Attack boost. Life Orb is the only item this set should run; otherwise it struggles to 2HKO some walls.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>More often than not, starting with Draco Meteor is the best option. Exceptions are if there's a Fairy-type Pokemon or a bulky Steel-type Pokemon in the opponent's team; in those cases, prediction could be used to 2HKO them if they switch in. This set should be used early- or mid-game to weaken the opposing team and allow a different Pokemon to do the sweeping. Hydreigon isn't frail, but it isn't particularly bulky either. Don't play Hydreigon recklessly, and try to avoid taking any unnecessary hits, as otherwise it can be worn down fairly quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is extremely important, as it helps Hydreigon get some important 2HKOs against some walls, such as Blissey and Umbreon, and helps it wear down the opponent's team. Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Roserade can set up entry hazards, and they can deal with Fairy-type Pokemon that might give Hydreigon problems. Pokemon that can deal with fast revenge killers or priority users, such as Crobat and Mega Aggron, help Hydreigon stay alive longer. Sweepers that can take advantage of Hydreigon's wallbreaking capabilities, such as Mega Sceptile and Kingdra, are good partners.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is strong enough to OHKO most offensive threats that don't resist it, especially if Stealth Rock is on the opponent's side of the field, making it great for revenge killing. Dark Pulse is a secondary STAB attack, that allows Hydreigon to revenge kill or clean up late-game without Special Attack drops. Fire Blast hits Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon for good damage and is Hydreigon's best option against Pokemon such as Lucario and Whimsicott. Dragon Pulse can be used as another consistent STAB attack; however, it doesn't give Hydreigon any useful coverage. U-turn is a good way of gaining momentum and does chip damage to potential switch-ins.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs maximize Hydreigon's Special Attack and Speed. 4 EVs in Special Defense prevent it from giving a Special Attack boost to Download users. A Timid nature with a Choice Scarf is needed to be able to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Darmanitan and Krookodile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set only really works as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner, as it lacks the power to fulfill any other role. Hydreigon's U-turn might be weak, but it is still a great spammable move because it steals momentum from the opponent if they decide to switch out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hydreigon appreciates entry hazard support, especially Stealth Rock, because it needs it to be able to OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl. This set is really vulnerable to Fairy-types, making Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Empoleon great partners, thanks to their ability to effortlessly switch into Fairy-type Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock. Strong physical attackers, such as Heracross and Infernape, can be used to take advantage of special walls trying to beat Hydreigon.</p>"
      },
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt allows Hydreigon to shut down most specially defensive Pokemon that try to counter it, such as Umbreon, Blissey, and Vaporeon. It also allows Hydreigon to act as a stallbreaker and stop some entry hazard setters, such as Tentacruel and Swampert. Roost helps Hydreigon stay healthy, which means the aforementioned walls are not able to wear it down after being Taunted. Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's main attack move because it has great neutral coverage and a 20% flinch chance, which makes it extremely spammable. Dragon Pulse is slightly stronger than Dark Pulse, which is helpful for wearing down most Pokemon. Fire Blast OHKOes Whimsicott, which is otherwise a big problem for this set, and also allows Hydreigon to OHKO Chesnaught and Forretress. Draco Meteor can be used to do huge immediate damage, because Dark Pulse already provides a consistent STAB attack without drawbacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Hydreigon's Special Attack and Speed, while 4 EVs in Special Defense prevent Download users from getting a Special Attack boost. A Timid nature is needed to be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Haxorus, Krookodile, and Roserade. Life Orb helps Hydreigon wear down walls significantly faster, as well as making it a much bigger offensive threat in general. However, Leftovers is an option because it makes Hydreigon much harder to wear down, which helps it deal with Scald users, such as Suicune and Vaporeon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is pretty straightforward. Attack the opponent's team until you need to use Taunt to shut down a wall. Counting Taunt turns is a must, because if Hydreigon is at low health the turn its effect ends, the foe might be able to cripple Hydreigon or heal if you decide to Roost, and if you don't, Hydreigon might faint.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is extremely important for this set, because it forces a huge amount of switches and helps Hydreigon wear down the opponent's team. Toxic Spikes deserve a special mention because they make Hydreigon's job significantly easier. Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Roserade are great partners, because they can deal with Fairy-type Pokemon and set up entry hazards. Special sweepers, such as Celebi and Mega Sceptile, appreciate Hydreigon's ability to wear down walls that give them trouble.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor, when boosted by Choice Specs, is one of the scariest special attacks in the tier, outdamaging others like Choice Specs Sylveon's Hyper Voice and Adaptability Choice Specs Porygon-Z's Tri-Attack. Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's most spammable move, as it has great neutral coverage and hits most of the tier for excellent damage. Flash Cannon hits Fairy-type switch-ins, OHKOing Whimsicott and 2HKOing Florges and Sylveon if entry hazards are down. Focus Blast allows Hydreigon to break through many common special walls in the tier, including Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2. U-turn is an option over Focus Blast that allows Hydreigon to bluff a Choice Scarf set and maintain momentum early-game. Flamethrower is an option over Focus Blast as well, as it allows Hydreigon to OHKO Pokemon that resist its STAB moves such as Cobalion and Lucario without relying on the unreliable Focus Blast, but Hydreigon will miss the coverage against the aforementioned Special walls.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment ensures Hydreigon hits as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Hydreigon to outpace key threats such as Entei, Krookodile, and Kyurem. Choice Specs is the item of choice for this set, providing maximum power to Hydreigon's attacks and even allowing it to beat most special walls.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Hydreigon trades the ability to switch moves or heal itself for the power and consistency of its potent STAB attacks as well as the ability to surprise and break through Fairy-type Pokemon without relying on Iron Tail's shaky accuracy. This set is particularly proficient at breaking down walls in the early-game, allowing another sweeper to come in and clean house late-game. Against teams that lack a Fairy-type Pokemon, there are very few drawbacks to using Draco Meteor early-game, as the power of a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor will even punch through moderately bulky switch-ins such as Cobalion. Dark Pulse is an easy move to spam mid-game, hitting most of the tier for good damage and even hitting hard enough to break down softer checks to Hydreigon such as Empoleon and Whimsicott without requiring prediction. Try to bring Hydreigon in on weak resisted moves or those that it is immune to; though the lack of Life Orb recoil aids its longevity overall, it lacks Roost to recover from strong attacks. This means that it cannot reliably check Pokemon such as Krookodile or Entei, so be sure to play around them carefully.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Hydreigon fits best on bulkier offensive teams that most benefit from its ability to punch through walls. Pokemon such as Conkeldurr, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Heracross all particularly appreciate Hydreigon's ability to lure and weaken Fairy-type Pokemon with Flash Cannon. Hydreigon always appreciates entry hazard support, as that allows it to secure several key OHKOs and 2HKOs it would otherwise miss, such as the guaranteed 2HKO on Blissey with Focus Blast or Calm Florges with Flash Cannon. Forretress is a particularly good partner, as it can set up Spikes against defensive Fairy-type Pokemon to ensure their KOs later in the game. As Choice Specs Hydreigon lacks longevity, it also appreciates VoltTurn support to get it in safely. The aforementioned Forretress helps here, as does Choice Scarf Infernape, which can also clean up late-game after Hydreigon softens up the opposing team's bulky Water-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type Pokemon. Mega Beedrill is another great fit, as Hydreigon threatens many of the bulky Steel-type Pokemon that would otherwise switch into Mega Beedrill's U-turn.</p>"

  "Cobalion": {
    "overview": "<p>Cobalion is very diverse, being able to attack or support with equal efficiency given its well-rounded stats. Its dual base 90 offenses and great Speed combined with its access to Swords Dance and Calm Mind means it is perfectly equipped to sweep both physically and specially. Its Steel / Fighting typing gives it a STAB attack to deal with Fairy-types, which few other Fighting-types can boast. It also gives Cobalion a resistance to Dark-type moves, which combined with its fantastic Defense stat and ability Justified makes Cobalion an excellent Knock Off absorber. Furthermore, Cobalion is 4x resistant to Stealth Rock and immune to Toxic Spikes, which makes it easy for it to switch in multiple times throughout the match.</p> <p>On the downside, base 90 / 90 offenses are average at best, so although Cobalion is capable of boosting both, it lacks significant immediate power. It is also hampered by a poor base 72 Special Defense and weaknesses to common attacking types such as Fire, Fighting, and Ground.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cobalion has a very diverse movepool with a wide range of options, but not all are viable. A mixed Work Up set can be used to enable Cobalion to lure in and break through specific checks, but it would usually be too weak to actually attempt a sweep. Rock Polish can be used to boost Cobalion's Speed to sky-high levels, but again its average offenses are a stumbling block in any sweeping attempt. With its access to Volt Switch, Cobalion can run a decent enough Choice Scarf set to scout and revenge kill, while also offering surprise factor. Sacred Sword is an option on the physical sets, compromising the power of Close Combat in exchange for not lowering Cobalion's defenses. It also has the added benefit of 2HKOing Curselax no matter how many Curses the latter has set up, but it's generally not recommended, as Cobalion really needs all the power it can get. Air Balloon can be used on Swords Dance sets to offer a one-time immunity to Ground-type attacks, as well as letting it have flexibility in its last moveslot. Salac Berry can also be used as Cobalion is bulky enough to survive most attacks from full health. With the Speed boost and a potential Swords Dance boost, it can easily sweep offensive teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Physically bulky Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and Gligar are usually hard counters to the Swords Dance set, but they will lose if Cobalion runs Magnet Rise. Also, with a Life Orb and a Calm Mind boost, Cobalion can OHKO offensive Nidoqueen and 2HKO non-specially defensive Gligar.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: The likes of Slowking, Reuniclus, and Cresselia are almost impossible to break through for Cobalion unless it runs X-Scissor on the Swords Dance set. Even then, a +2 X-Scissor only 3HKOes Cresselia. The Calm Mind set fares better, as Cobalion can break through them with Hidden Power Ghost after a few boosts, but Cobalion will always lose if they run Calm Mind themselves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Swampert, Tentacruel, Alomomola, and Suicune are all decent checks for the Swords Dance set, as they can comfortably survive any hit and threaten back with a Scald burn or a super effective Earthquake in Swampert's case. However, Alomomola is complete setup bait if Cobalion packs Substitute, as is Tentacruel for the Calm Mind set unless it packs Haze. Suicune will always win against the Calm Mind set if it runs Calm Mind itself, though.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that naturally outspeed Cobalion, such as Mega Sceptile and Noivern, along with common Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao, Krookodile, and Darmanitan, can easily revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Certain Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Jellicent, and Doublade resist both of Cobalion's STAB types and so are hard counters to all its sets unless Cobalion runs Hidden Power Ghost on its Calm Mind set. Chandelure also loses if Cobalion carries Stone Edge. Cofagrigus can burn Cobalion, but it faces trouble against the Substitute set and outright loses to the Calm Mind set unless it packs Nasty Plot.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Cobalion is one of the fastest users of Stealth Rock, making it an excellent choice to set it up for offensive teams. Close Combat is a high-powered STAB move. Volt Switch helps gain momentum for your team while allowing Cobalion to rack up some damage on Pokemon weak to Electric-type attacks, such as Mega Blastoise and Crobat. Iron Head is an alternative STAB move that does not lower Cobalion's defenses and provides useful coverage against Fairies, while hitting the likes of Mega Aerodactyl and Heracross harder. Taunt can be used instead of Iron Head to shut down setup sweepers, such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, and to prevent entry hazards from being set up on your side. Thunder Wave is also an option that Cobalion can use to offer useful team support.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and a Jolly nature allow Cobalion to maintain its crucial Speed tier, outspeeding the likes of Mienshao and Shaymin while Speed tying with Infernape and Virizion. Maximum Attack EVs are used to back up Cobalion's average Attack. Leftovers increases Cobalion's longevity, but Shuca Berry can be used instead to better check Earthquake Mega Aerodactyl. Shuca Berry also allows Cobalion to safely stay in on common switch-ins, such as Gligar, Swampert, and Nidoqueen, and use Taunt to prevent them from setting up their own entry hazards. An alternative spread of 248 HP / 28 Atk / 232 Spe with a Jolly nature is enough to outspeed Mienshao and builds on Cobalion's decent natural bulk, allowing it to take hits such as Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Shaymin's Seed Flare better. It still OHKOes or 2HKOes frail offensive Pokemon such as Lucario, but Cobalion will be considerably weaker against defensive teams. For example, Cobalion now fails to 2HKO standard Florges with Iron Head when using this spread.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Cobalion plays as a fast support Pokemon. Aim to use it early-game in order to get entry hazards up and gain momentum for your team. With its great physical bulk and resistances, Cobalion should find plenty of opportunities to come in throughout the match. It checks a lot of common offensive Pokemon, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Lucario, Mega Beedrill, Kyurem, Mega Abomasnow, and Mega Sharpedo. Justified provides Cobalion with a free Attack boost when hit by a Dark-type move, so it is an excellent Knock Off absorber. Avoid using Close Combat unless it is absolutely necessary, as the resulting stat drops compromise Cobalion's good bulk and make it more susceptible to being revenge killed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special sweepers, such as Hydreigon and Mega Sceptile, appreciate Cobalion's ability to deal with special walls, such as Blissey and Umbreon, while setting Stealth Rock to wear down their checks and counters. In general, sweepers that benefit from entry hazard support are great partners. Because Cobalion has poor Special Defense and weaknesses to common attacking types, bulky Pokemon that cover these weaknesses, such as Suicune, Mega Blastoise, and Cresselia, work well with it.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat and Iron Head are powerful STAB moves that offer good neutral coverage. Swords Dance makes Cobalion significantly more threatening; for example, with Life Orb and a +2 boost Cobalion can OHKO Mega Swampert with Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. Stone Edge rounds out Cobalion's coverage perfectly, smashing Flying- and Fire-types such as Crobat and Entei. It also offers a neutral hit on Pokemon that resist Cobalion's STAB moves, such as Tentacruel. Substitute is an alternative over Stone Edge that allows Cobalion to avoid status and take advantage of its excellent natural bulk and physical resistances. Magnet Rise turns Ground-type counters such as Gligar and Nidoqueen into setup bait, and as a result any team that relies on such Pokemon to counter Cobalion will find themselves very hard-pressed to prevent a sweep if Cobalion carries the move. X-Scissor is another option to hit bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Slowking super effectively. Stealth Rock can be run in the fourth slot if your team can't find room anywhere else and the coverage provided from Stone Edge isn't needed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Cobalion to deal as much damage and be as fast as possible. Life Orb can be used if running three attacks, as Cobalion really appreciates the additional power boost. However, it does compromise Cobalion's decent bulk, so Lum Berry can be used instead to allow Cobalion to shrug off Scald burns and other status. Leftovers is recommended if you run Substitute to increase Cobalion's longevity. Additionally, Substitute can allow Cobalion to accumulate multiple boosts, so the lack of Life Orb should not matter in the long run.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can either use its strong attacks early-game to punch holes in teams to open up a sweep for a team member or attempt a sweep itself late-game with its high Speed and good bulk. It's recommended to weaken Cobalion's checks and counters, such as Gligar and Swampert, as well as eliminate any possible revenge killers before attempting to sweep. Cobalion finds plenty of opportunities to come in and set up with its excellent bulk and resistances, particularly against Choice-locked Dark-type moves, which Cobalion can attempt to take advantage of with Justified to gain a useful Attack boost. While Cobalion may be outclassed by Lucario in terms of raw power, its higher bulk allows it to accumulate more boosts, and its much better Speed gives it more sweeping potential.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards greatly aid Cobalion in its sweep, so Stealth Rock users such as Swampert and Spikes users such as Froslass and Roserade make great partners. Cobalion is vulnerable to Fire-type moves and Scald, so bulky Pokemon that resist such moves, such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise, are solid teammates. Powerful special attackers such as Hydreigon and Mega Blastoise lure in the likes of Blissey and Umbreon, which Cobalion can easily set up on. As previously mentioned, it's a good idea to weaken Cobalion's counters before attempting a sweep, so powerful Choice Band users such as Heracross and Entei can be used to weaken bulky Ground-types such as Gligar, Swampert and Nidoqueen. Dark-types and Bug-types help take care of bulky Psychic-types such as Slowking and Cresselia, which are almost impossible for Cobalion to break through. Krookodile and Escavalier in particular can heavily weaken them with Pursuit to allow Cobalion to muscle past them later.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Cobalion's Special Attack to high levels, enabling it to attempt a sweep after a few boosts, while simultaneously patching up Cobalion's low Special Defense to make it harder to defeat. This makes it a great tank both physically and specially, considering its excellent Defense stat. Focus Blast is a high-powered, albeit inaccurate, STAB move that deals a lot of damage after a boost. Flash Cannon is a more reliable secondary STAB move that enables Cobalion to break through Fairies and provides decent neutral coverage alongside Focus Blast. Hidden Power Ghost is the preferred option in the last slot, allowing Cobalion to beat Ghost-types that resist both of its STAB types, such as Chandelure and Jellicent. Substitute can be used instead, as it allows Cobalion to avoid status and take advantage of its excellent natural bulk and physical resistances. With a few boosts Cobalion can also set up unbreakable Substitutes against weak special attackers such as Tentacruel. Magnet Rise turns Ground-type checks such as specially defensive Gligar into setup bait, and as a result any team that relies on such Pokemon to counter Cobalion will find themselves very hard-pressed to prevent a sweep if Cobalion carries this move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed are used so that Cobalion can deal as much damage and be as fast as possible. Life Orb is recommended if running three attacks, as Cobalion really appreciates the additional power boost. However, it does compromise Cobalion's decent bulk, so Lum Berry can be used to allow Cobalion to shrug off status. This set is not badly affected by burns, so Leftovers is generally a better option than Lum Berry. Leftovers is a given if you run Substitute, though, in order to create more Substitutes. Additionally, Substitute allows Cobalion to accumulate multiple boosts, so the lack of Life Orb should not matter in the long run.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The surprise factor of this set plays a huge role, as teams will usually expect a physical set from Cobalion and react accordingly. This Cobalion's specially based nature allows it to break through Pokemon that would wall a physical set quite handily; for example, a +1 Life Orb Focus Blast OHKOes physically defensive Swampert after Stealth Rock and Spikes. As such, it can be used to eliminate certain physical walls to open up a sweep for one of its teammates. With its high Speed, it can also attempt a sweep on its own late-game. Due to Calm Mind boosting Cobalion's Special Defense, it can set up on specially attacking walls such as Alomomola, Cresselia, and Tentacruel. At +1, it can even set up unbreakable Substitutes against them. Be wary about Scald burns from bulky Water-types, though, as even though they don't affect Cobalion's damage output, they still hinder its longevity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards greatly aid Cobalion in its sweep, so Stealth Rock users such as Swampert and Spikes users such as Froslass and Roserade make great partners. Cobalion has common weaknesses, so Pokemon that synergize well with it defensively, such as Suicune and Swampert, are solid teammates. Special attackers such as Hydreigon and Chandelure lure in the likes of Florges and Umbreon, which Cobalion can easily set up on. Powerful physical attackers such as Heracross, Mega Aerodactyl, and Tyrantrum, which appreciate Cobalion's ability to lure in and eliminate or weaken their counters, are also excellent partners. Dark-types and Bug-types help take care of bulky Psychic-types such as Slowking and Cresselia, which are almost impossible for Cobalion to break through if they pack Calm Mind themselves. Krookodile and Escavalier in particular can heavily weaken them with Pursuit to enable Cobalion to muscle through them later.</p>"

  "Virizion": {
    "overview": "<p>While Virizion has a unique niche as a fast physical Grass-type with access to Swords Dance, it needs a lot of support to be effective. Virizion does threaten many common Pokemon, such as Suicune, Hydreigon, and Krookodile, with its STAB combination, but it lacks the coverage and power to deal with a large portion of the tier. Defensive Fairy-types, such as Florges, Sylveon, and Whimsicott wall it well, while faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Crobat are common enough to revenge kill it. Celebi, one of the best Pokemon in UU, completely stops Virizion unless it runs X-Scissor, in which case Flying-, Poison-, and Bug-types can switch into Virizion with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Virizion gets access to Light Screen and Reflect, making a support set with both of those along with Taunt a possibility; however, such a set is outclassed by Espeon and Cresselia. Sacred Sword could be used over Close Combat on the Swords Dance set should the Defense and Special Defense drops seem detrimental, but it is generally not worth it. A Life Orb can also be utilized by Virizion to give it more immediate power before setting up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types, such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, easily take Virizion's STAB attacks and can OHKO with their STAB attacks, although they have to be wary of Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist both of Virizion's STAB attacks and can retaliate with their own super effective STAB attacks; Mega Beedrill and Toxicroak are examples of this.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types, such as Reuniclus and Cresselia, can take any boosted hit by Virizion and proceed to KO Virizion with a STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users and naturally faster Pokemon, such as Mienshao and Noivern respectively, can easily revenge kill Virizion after getting a free switch into it. Whimsicott gets a special mention for being able to resist both of Virizion's STAB attacks and either lock it into a support move with Encore or KO it with a STAB Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Entei, defensive Arcanine, and Chandelure, can easily take an unboosted STAB attack from Virizion and OHKO in return, although they have to be wary of Stone Edge.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Virizion doesn't hit hard initially, making Swords Dance a good way to boost Virizion's Attack stat by two stages. Leaf Blade is a good STAB attack that also has a high critical hit ratio. Close Combat is another good STAB attack that has a high Base Power of 120, although it lowers Virizion's defenses, making Virizion more prone to being revenge killed. Stone Edge is a good coverage move that allows Virizion to hit Flying-types and Chandelure, which wall Virizion otherwise, for super effective damage. X-Scissor specifically targets Celebi which would otherwise stop Virizion cold. Zen Headbutt allows Virizion to hit Poison-types, which resist Virizion's STAB types, for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Lum Berry is chosen as Virizion's held item, as it allows Virizion to have a one-time immunity to status. A Life Orb can be used over this to give Virizion more immediate attacking power, but this makes it harder for Virizion to switch into bulky Water-types. 252 EVs are put into Attack and Speed to maximize Virizion's sweeping potential. A Jolly nature is used in order to Speed tie with other positive-natured base 108 Speed Pokemon, namely Cobalion and Infernape.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Virizion should be sent in mid- or late-game to have the easiest time sweeping. Virizion should also take advantage of its typing by using bulky Water-types as setup fodder. Flying-types tend to switch into Virizion, so attempt to take advantage of that by either switching to the appropriate Pokemon or using Stone Edge on a predicted switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers make for excellent partners, as they allow Virizion to sweep with ease, so consider using Choice Specs Hydreigon or Choice Band Heracross alongside it. Virizion appreciates entry hazard support, making entry hazard setters such as Forretress and Nidoqueen good teammates. Cleaners, such as Speed Boost Yanmega and Mega Sharpedo, make for good teammates as well, as they can capitalize on Virizion's ability to weaken a team during a sweep. Lastly, Rock-types, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum, make for good teammates, as they can threaten the Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-type Pokemon that can force Virizion out.</p>"

Its movepool complements its abilities, as it has access to excellent support moves such as Taunt, Tailwind, and Rain Dance alongside a great offensive movepool including Acrobatics, Hurricane, Knock Off, Superpower, and Focus Blast.</p> <p>However, Tornadus has to be very careful due to its below average 79 / 70 / 80 bulk. Its Stealth Rock weakness also makes it difficult to bring onto the field safely. Tornadus is also outsped by a lot of Pokemon in UU, such as Mega Beedrill and Crobat, who can proceed to U-turn out, or Mega Aerodactyl, who OHKOes it with a super effective STAB attack. Additionally, Tornadus's most powerful moves in Hurricane and Focus Blast suffer from low accuracy, making it somewhat unreliable compared to other special attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With the strongest Hurricane in the tier, Tornadus can utilize Choice Specs to further increase its power and OHKO several bulky offensive threats such as Nidoqueen. Choice Scarf is an option, but Prankster Tailwind support with Life Orb is generally sufficient.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Ampharos can easily take any attack and KO in return, while Jolteon outspeeds Tornadus and easily KOes it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Empoleon can take Tornadus's STAB moves and, in Mega Aggron's case, anything else Tornadus has to offer. Even Life Orb Tornadus has to nail Mega Aggron on the switch to make sure it faints before it KOes Tornadus with Heavy Slam. Bronzong and Metagross are also solid checks to Tornadus, though Metagross must be wary of switching directly into Focus Blast or Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Mega Aerodactyl</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds and easily KOs Tornadus while resisting Hurricane. It can switch into most of Tornadus's attacks, but can be lured with Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Diancie</strong>: Diancie can easily shrug off any attack besides Iron Tail and KO in return with Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Blissey, Florges, Snorlax, and Umbreon can take most special hits from Tornadus, though all are easily disposed of by mixed or physical variants.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is the STAB move of choice, hitting very hard coming off Tornadus's base 125 Special Attack stat and having great neutral coverage against most of the tier. Focus Blast hits many Steel-types, such as Mega Aggron and Empoleon, as well as most special walls, including Snorlax, Umbreon, and Porygon2. Heat Wave hits Doublade, Forretress, and Bronzong, but makes Tornadus less effective against the aforementioned special walls. Grass Knot is a reliable move to 2HKO most Water-types. Tailwind can be used to support slower teammates and check faster foes. Alternatively, Taunt can be used to prevent Pokemon like Florges, Sableye, and Suicune from recovering after taking Tornadus's attacks. Air Slash can be used if Hurricane's accuracy is a problem, but its significantly lower base power makes it hard for Tornadus to effectively wear down defensive Pokemon. Iron Tail is an option to 2HKO Florges and nail Mega Aerodactyl on the switch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are used to allow Tornadus to hit as hard and as fast as it can. A Life Orb is used to further bolster Tornadus's power. A Timid nature is needed to outspeed threats such as Infernape and Cobalion. Prankster allows Tornadus to set up Tailwind against Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Swampert before it is KOed; if Tornadus chooses to run Taunt instead, Prankster is important to prevent Sableye from using Recover.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set uses Tornadus's impressive Special Attack in combination with its powerful moves to punch huge holes in teams while also potentially supporting its team with Tailwind. Against defensive teams, Tornadus can come in early-game and start to fire off attacks, easily wearing down special walls with its raw power, coverage, and Taunt. Against offensive teams, Tornadus can set up Tailwind mid- to late-game to allow its teammates to clean up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Life Orb Tornadus works best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to break down Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon. Mega Sceptile can take advantage of these weakened Pokemon and also can capitalize on Florges and Mega Aerodactyl that are lured with Tornadus's Iron Tail. Choice Scarf Hydreigon also appreciates these foes being weakened or KOed. Entry hazard support is key; offensive Stealth Rock users such as Aerodactyl and Krookodile fit well on teams with Tornadus. With Tailwind support, slower powerhouses become extremely dangerous; examples of these include Nidoqueen, Mega Blastoise, Mamoswine, Heracross, and Tyrantrum.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Prankster allows Tornadus to have a priority setup move in Bulk Up, which boosts its Attack and Defense stats. Acrobatics is a STAB move that hits very hard with no item. Rest is a great recovery move that gains +1 priority thanks to Prankster, ridding Tornadus of status while fully restoring its health. The last slot is dependent on whether you want coverage or reliability while asleep. Knock Off allows Tornadus to hit a ton of Pokemon that resist Acrobatics while also making them lose their item. Sleep Talk not only allows Tornadus to not only Rest multiple times, but also grants it a priority Acrobatics.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Tornadus to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Chesto Berry guarantees a one-time wake-up from Rest, however running no item is also perfectly viable as it allows Tornadus's Acrobatics to hit harder initially. A Jolly nature is necessary to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Froslass and other Pokemon below that Speed tier, such as Infernape and Mienshao.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is used best as a late-game cleaner or win condition once walls are broken down and Steel-, Electric-, and Rock-types are out of the way. This set also capitalizes on Tornadus's amazing ability in Prankster, which gives it access to priority recovery, priority setup, and even priority attacking via Sleep Talk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support is necessary, as Steel-types, which resist Tornadus's STAB moves, are usually grounded and resist Stealth Rock. Froslass is a good partner, as it can easily spinblock while setting Spikes up. Another good partner is Custap Berry lead Forretress, as it can not only set up Spikes, but can also set up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, pressuring the opponent to find an answer to Tornadus quickly. Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Heracross, can provide excellent support as they can easily wear down the walls that can continuously annoy Tornadus, such as Mega Aggron. Entry hazard clearing in the form of Defog or Rapid Spin is greatly appreciated, as Tornadus is weak to Stealth Rock, so it has a limited number of switches. Mega Blastoise is a great partner, as it can spin away entry hazards while also functioning as a wallbreaker.</p>"
      },
      "Defiant Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Acrobatics is a STAB move and hits hard because Tornadus is carrying no item. Knock Off removes the foe's item while also hitting bulky Psychic-types that might want to switch into Tornadus. Superpower is used to get past the Steel-types that might try to switch into Acrobatics. U-turn allows Tornadus to keep up momentum while wearing down the opponent's team. Iron Tail hits Mega Aerodactyl and Florges, two Pokemon that commonly switch into Tornadus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>No item is used so that Acrobatics hits as hard as it can, while Defiant is used to not only boost Tornadus's Attack stat by two stages but also punish Defog users. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used so Tornadus can hit as hard and as fast as it can. A Jolly nature is necessary, as an Adamant Tornadus is outsped by common Pokemon such as Mienshao and Infernape.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While this set doesn't have the raw power of the specially attacking variant, Pokemon such as Florges and Blissey that expect to tank Hurricanes are instead 2HKOed by Acrobatics. Pokemon such as Cresselia can be effectively pressured with the combination of Knock Off and Acrobatics. Tornadus's decent coverage means that it can easily weaken or KO common Flying resistances such as Empoleon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tornadus appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support, as otherwise it would be difficult to get onto the field. Heliolisk and Mega Beedrill are partners that can gather momentum while chipping away at Tornadus's checks. This set also likes wallbreakers, as it is a nice late-game cleaner against balanced teams. Pokemon such as Life Orb Kyurem and Choice Specs Chandelure are great partners, as they wear down the bulky Steel-types that tend to wall Tornadus. This set loves entry hazards being off the field, as it has no recovery and is worn down very easily by Stealth Rock. Forretress and Empoleon make for great partners, as both can easily get rid of entry hazards while setting hazards of their own.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Tornadus's Prankster ability, it is able to set up Rain Dance multiple times throughout the match, giving rain teams a reliable setter. Taunt allows Tornadus to beat out other leads while it sets up rain or Tailwind. Hurricane is Tornadus's most powerful attack and heavily benefits from its accuracy boost in the rain. Focus Blast provides excellent coverage alongside Hurricane. U-turn can be used instead to gain momentum for its team and allow a rain sweeper to start abusing rain turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set aims to help the team through Tornadus's support moves and ability. Rain Dance and Taunt gain priority thanks to Prankster, letting Tornadus get off a move before getting KOed by a faster threat. Damp Rock is used to provide additional turns of rain to its teammates. Life Orb can be used instead to power up Tornadus's attacks, but Tornadus would usually rather focus on supporting its teammates by providing extra rain turns. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are used, outspeeding Pokemon such as Froslass and Infernape. A Timid nature is preferred so that Tornadus can outspeed positive-natured base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Froslass and anything slower.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With Rain Dance, Tornadus is a staple on any rain team, as it has an abusable STAB move that gains 100% accuracy under the rain and Prankster to make sure rain can be set up consistently. Try to bring in Tornadus on a resisted hit or after a teammate has fainted, as it is pretty frail and does not like taking hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Swampert is an amazing partner, as it not only tanks Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves for Tornadus, but it also benefits from the rain, gaining a Speed boost thanks to Swift Swim and hitting hard thanks to a base 150 Attack stat and good coverage. Other Swift Swim abusers include Kingdra, Kabutops, and Ludicolo. Tornadus should normally be paired with another Rain Dance user on full rain teams; Uxie can set up Rain Dance and Stealth Rock to further support its team.</p>"

  "Kyurem": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyurem is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the entire UU metagame. With an excellent base 130 Special Attack and decent base 95 Speed, it is very effective as a wallbreaker or a revenge killer, giving both bulky teams and hyper offense teams headaches. Additionally, Kyurem's respectable bulk, surprisingly decent defensive typing, and Pressure allow it to be a formidable PP staller, all while maintaining a strong offensive presence. Kyurem can even get past opposing Steel- and Fairy-types that can switch into its STAB attacks with Earth Power and Flash Cannon, respectively. On the downside, while base 95 Speed is enough for Kyurem to revenge kill with a Choice Scarf, it's fairly lackluster on its own, leaving Kyurem outsped by threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Cobalion. While Kyurem's typing gives it useful resistances to Grass-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks, it also gives Kyurem weaknesses to Dragon- and Fighting-type moves. This makes Kyurem easily revenge killed, as most Dragon- and Fighting-types such as Hydreigon and Mienshao outspeed it. Kyurem also possesses a nasty weakness to Stealth Rock, meaning it will have trouble switching in, which it must do often if it is running a Choice item. Nonetheless, Kyurem's versatility in UU means it should always be considered for a team of any archetype.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hone Claws can be used to boost Kyurem's Attack, but Kyurem has no physical Ice-type STAB moves to take advantage of, so it is outclassed by Kyurem's other offensive options. Dual screens can provide Kyurem's teammates with some extra bulk, but Kyurem is better off attacking or stalling. Dragon Tail allows Kyurem to phaze stat boosters that attempt to use its SubRoost set as setup bait.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fast Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Infernape outspeed most variants of Kyurem and threaten it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fast Dragon-types</strong>: Both Hydreigon and Haxorus outspeed Kyurem and OHKO it with their Dragon-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Even with Outrage, Iron Head, and Focus Blast, Kyurem still struggles against Blissey, Snorlax, Umbreon, and Florges.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong and Escavalier hard counter Kyurem because they wall all of its common special attacking moves and resist Outrage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is extremely powerful due to the STAB boost and Choice Specs, and it isn't even that weak if Kyurem needs to use it consecutively. Ice Beam is a more reliable STAB attack that does not lower Kyurem's Special Attack and still hits hard with Choice Specs. Earth Power smashes the Fire-types that resist Ice Beam and the Steel-types that resist both Ice Beam and Draco Meteor. Focus Blast allows Kyurem to break Umbreon, Snorlax, and Blissey. Dragon Pulse is an alternate STAB move with good neutral coverage, hitting Kingdra and opposing Kyurem super effectively, while Flash Cannon is another option for Kyurem to beat Florges.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs boosts Kyurem's Special Attack, making it a fearsome wallbreaker. Speed and Special Attack are maximized to make the most of Kyurem's wallbreaking potential. A Timid nature is preferred to get the jump on positive-natured Roserade, Krookodile, and Heracross, though a Modest nature can be used to 2HKO Florges or Blissey with Flash Cannon and Focus Blast, respectively. Alternatively, a bulky spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD prolongs Kyurem's presence on the battlefield.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set has the role of a wallbreaker, so use Kyurem in the early-game or mid-game in order to wear down the opposing team. Though Draco Meteor hits extremely hard, don't spam it, as its side effect of lowering Kyurem's Special Attack allows Kyurem to be walled after enough uses of the move. Moreover, as Kyurem will be switching out often, use this set as a way to pivot around, and be sure to clear the field of entry hazards so Kyurem can come back in safely.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>If running a Timid nature, entry hazard support is required for Kyurem to 2HKO Blissey and Florges with Focus Blast and Flash Cannon, respectively. Swampert, Metagross, Empoleon, and Gligar can all set up Stealth Rock to aid Kyurem's wallbreaking. Setup sweepers such as Lucario and Haxorus appreciate Kyurem wearing down walls, thus aiding their sweeps. Entry hazard removal is necessary so Kyurem can switch out in order to change moves. Blastoise is a great spinner that forms a dual-wallbreaking core with Kyurem.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is very powerful coming off of a base 130 Special Attack stat. Ice Beam is a more reliable STAB attack that does not lower Kyurem's Special Attack. Earth Power hits the Steel-types that wall Kyurem's STAB combination, such as Mega Aggron, as well as Fire-types such as Entei, which resist Ice Beam. Dragon Pulse is an alternative STAB attack that gives Kyurem a better shot at beating bulky Water-types such as Suicune.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf boosts Kyurem's lackluster base 95 Speed to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and make it a solid revenge killer. Special Attack and Speed are maximized to increase Kyurem's offensive capability. A Timid nature allows Kyurem to Speed tie with other Choice Scarf Pokemon with base 95 Speed, such as Darmanitan.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As Kyurem has no way of boosting its offense, this set is relegated to the role of a late-game cleaner. If the opposing team hasn't been weakened enough, you may need to switch Kyurem out frequently in order to change moves, so keep Stealth Rock off the field at all times. Use this set to land a surprise KO on Kyurem's checks such as Infernape and Mega Aerodactyl, which would outspeed and OHKO Kyurem otherwise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Choice Scarf Kyurem sometimes finds itself lacking in power, a physical wallbreaker such as Darmanitan can wear down the special walls that Kyurem can't break. Heal Bell support from Sylveon can heal Kyurem's paralysis, as Kyurem loses its ability to revenge kill if it is paralyzed. Entry hazard control is important to allow Kyurem to have an easier time landing KOs and to switch in more easily. Forretress and Empoleon can both set entry hazards and remove them.</p>"
      },
      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Kyurem to absorb status and PP stall the foe with Pressure as they try to break the Substitute. Roost heals off the HP lost by using Substitute and makes Kyurem harder to take down in general. Ice Beam is Kyurem's STAB move and gives it solid offensive presence, despite being a wall. Earth Power has great synergy with Ice Beam, hitting the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Kyurem's Ice-type STAB move, in addition to hitting bulky Water-types harder. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to put a timer on opposing sweepers and defensive Pokemon. With Toxic in combination with Substitute and Roost, Kyurem can do a great job at stalling its foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP EVs allow Kyurem to make 101 HP Substitutes, preventing Blissey from breaking its Substitutes with a single Seismic Toss. 232 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are necessary to outspeed Jolly Krookodile. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to make Kyurem as powerful as possible. Leftovers promotes Kyurem's longevity and makes it very difficult to take down in combination with Substitute and Roost. Alternatively, Life Orb raises the power of Kyurem's attacks, and Roost can heal off the recoil from Life Orb. Pressure makes foes lose 2 PP whenever they use a move. Couple that with Kyurem's bulk, and it becomes adept at PP stalling.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is for stalling out low PP moves such as Draco Meteor, Close Combat, and Stone Edge. Kyurem can be brought in at any point in the game to stall, but make sure to bring it into battle against Pokemon that can't break its Substitute with one hit, such as Blissey. Infiltrator users such as Crobat and Noivern can hit through Kyurem's Substitute and give it trouble, so be cautious if the opponent packs one. Kyurem's offensive capability turns it into a tank instead of a wall, so take advantage of it to weaken foes as they try to break Kyurem down. This set struggles mightily with dedicated walls, so be sure to scout with Substitute and Toxic in order to win stall wars.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A physical wallbreaker such as Mienshao can deal with the Pokemon that wall Kyurem, making it easier for Kyurem to outstall the opponent's team. An entry hazard remover such as Mega Blastoise can allow Kyurem to enter the battlefield unscathed. Mega Blastoise also doubles as a wallbreaker that can help Kyurem win stall wars should it lack Toxic. Florges can take the Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks that hit Kyurem for massive damage. As many of Kyurem's checks are Fighting-types, Spikes is preferred over Stealth Rock to help it wear down its checks. Forretress provides Spikes and removes entry hazards on Kyurem's side of the field. Offensive Pokemon such as Gyarados appreciate Kyurem's ability to stallbreak, allowing them to set up and sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor hits Kyurem's foes very hard with the boosts from STAB and Life Orb. Ice Beam is a second STAB attack that does not lower Kyurem's Special Attack, making it far more spammable than Draco Meteor. Earth Power hits the Steel-, Fire-, and Water-types that resist Kyurem's other attacks. Outrage is great for cleaning up in the late-game and taking on most special walls, while Iron Head 2HKOes Florges. If your team already handles special walls well enough, Roost can be used in the fourth slot to recover Life Orb damage. Kyurem is bulky enough to make use of recovery even on an offensive set such as this one.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb makes Kyurem function as a sweeper by boosting the power of its attacks and giving it the freedom to change moves at will. Special Attack and Speed are maximized to give Kyurem as much offensive presence as possible. A Hasty nature is necessary to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon and tie with other base 95 Speed Pokemon, and to not lower Kyurem's Attack should it be running Outrage or Iron Head. However, if running Roost, use a Timid nature instead.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Life Orb boosting Kyurem's damage output, this set has the role of a wallbreaker. The ability to switch moves means that Kyurem can stay in and sweep on its own, so this set does not rely heavily on entry hazard removal. Kyurem has few switch-ins because it hits both physically and specially, and it threatens Florges with the presence of Iron Head.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late-game cleaners such as Mega Beedrill appreciate Kyurem's wallbreaking ability, making it easier for them to finish off the weakened opposing team. Wish support from Florges can help Kyurem stay healthy enough to sweep. Entry hazard support from a setter such as Forretress or Celebi is important to allow Kyurem to have an easier time landing KOs. Sticky Web support from Galvantula or Shuckle allows Kyurem to outspeed some of its checks, such as Infernape.</p>"

  "Meloetta": {
    "overview": "<p>Meloetta has great 100 / 128 special bulk, allowing it to tank a lot of special hits and even some super effective ones. Meloetta also has access to a very diverse movepool with good attacking options such as Hyper Voice, Psyshock, and Dazzling Gleam; various setup options such as Relic Song and Calm Mind; and great utility moves such as Trick, U-turn, and Thunder Wave. Meloetta, in its Pirouette forme, also outspeeds a ton of common checks to its Aria forme, such as Krookodile and Hydreigon, allowing it to hit them with a super effective STAB Close Combat and surprise other Pokemon that outspeed it in its Aria forme.</p> <p>Despite Meloetta's superb special bulk, it has an underwhelming 100 / 77 physical bulk, making it more weak to Knock Off, Pursuit and U-turn than it already is. Its typing doesn't help matters either, providing only a resistance to Psychic and an immunity to Ghost while also making it weak to Bug- and Dark-type moves. It also has an average base 90 Speed stat in its Aria forme, meaning it is outsped by a ton of common Pokemon such as Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Sharpedo. Serene Grace isn't very useful either, although it helps grab some clutch Special Defense drops from Psychic or sleep turns from Relic Song.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Assault Vest is a decent item that allows Meloetta to tank all kinds of special hits while also being able to use the plethora of attacking moves it has. However, Meloetta isn't very powerful on its own and thus really likes the boosts it gets from Life Orb or Choice Specs; running an Assault Vest also prohibits it from boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense with Calm Mind. Meloetta has access to Thunderbolt, which could allow it to beat Suicune; however, Psyshock does this already and Meloetta doesn't need Thunderbolt otherwise. Dazzling Gleam can be used as a more reliable way to hit Dark-types; however, common Dark-types are faster, and Focus Blast hits them harder while allowing Meloetta to keep coverage on Mega Aggron and Snorlax. Grass Knot or Energy Ball can be good for the Choice Specs set to hit bulky Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Swampert, although Meloetta already has a hard time picking coverage moves and can usually cripple these Pokemon via Trick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Celebi and Hydreigon, can outspeed all of Meloetta's sets and U-turn out, wearing Meloetta down while gaining momentum.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill, Choice Scarf Heracross, and Choice Scarf Mienshao all threaten Meloetta with their STAB or coverage moves and can outspeed every Meloetta set.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pokemon such as Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl not only outspeed Meloetta but also can carry Pursuit, which is a huge thorn in Meloetta's side.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Florges and Blissey can handle Meloetta's Choice sets; however, they must watch out for Psyshock from the Choice Specs set, which can 2HKO both of them after Stealth Rock damage. Curse Snorlax is especially a nuisance, as it can boost its Defense and render Psyshock useless.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Empoleon only have to watch out for Focus Blast, as Meloetta's other moves do not hit hard enough to overpower them. Assault Vest Escavalier resists Psyshock and can take any move Meloetta has, including Focus Blast, as well as Pursuit the Meloetta, effectively removing or weakening it for the rest of the match.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute provides Meloetta with a way to avoid status, especially from Scald, and more setup opportunities. Calm Mind boosts Meloetta's already decent Special Attack and Special Defense stats. Psyshock allows Meloetta to win Calm Mind wars against other Pokemon such as Suicune, as it hits them on their non-boosted Defense stat. Hyper Voice is a great secondary STAB move, hitting through other Substitutes; however, you can opt for Focus Blast instead if you want a more reliable way to beat Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types such as Mega Aggron, Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Snorlax super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs let Meloetta hit as hard and as fast as possible; however, a spread of 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 Spe with a Timid nature may be used instead to still outspeed Jolly Toxicroak and Heracross while providing a bit more bulk. This spread can also set up more easily on Blissey, as Meloetta can produce 101 HP Substitutes. Leftovers is the preferred item to give Meloetta more Substitutes and a bit of recovery as well. A Timid nature means Meloetta isn't threatened by Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed it, such as Toxicroak and Heracross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Meloetta set is a great win condition against stall and semi-stall teams thanks to its ability to win Calm Mind wars with Psyshock and threaten foes that are resistant or immune to Psychic, such as Reuniclus and Krookodile, with Hyper Voice. Meloetta should be brought in mid- or late-game and is best setting up on attacks that cannot break its Substitute, such as an unboosted Scald from Suicune. Another way to set up is on Pokemon that can only inflict damage with Toxic or weak moves, such as Alomomola and Florges.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates wallbreakers to wear down Steel-types that force Meloetta out. Entei is a particularly good partner, as it can hit Steel-types with a super effective STAB move and spread burns, wearing down the opponent's team. Entry hazard support is necessary as well. Forretress is a particularly good partner, as it can sponge physical hits early-game and also clear entry hazards thanks to its access to Rapid Spin.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hyper Voice is an obligatory STAB move that hits very hard and can bypass Substitutes. Psyshock is nice to get around special walls such as Blissey and Florges; however, Psychic hits Mega Aerodactyl harder, along with Rhyperior and Cobalion. Focus Blast is a good coverage move, hitting bulky Steel-types such as Mega Aggron along with Dark-types such as Krookodile. Trick is a good utility move that cripples walls that may switch in, such as Alomomola. Shadow Ball, however, allows Meloetta to hit Ghost-types, such as Doublade and Chandelure, hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Meloetta to hit as hard and as fast as it can. Choice Specs boosts Meloetta's already amazing base 128 Special Attack stat. A Timid nature makes sure that Meloetta Speed ties with other positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Moltres while also outspeeding otherwise major threats such as Heracross.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Meloetta in early-game to break down walls and wear them down to allow teammates opportunities to set up or continue to apply the pressure. Meloetta can also be useful even after Tricking away its item, as it has decent special bulk and can still hit pretty hard. Meloetta can also come in on common walls, as it has a way around both special and physical walls thanks to its access to Psyshock and good special coverage moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Infernape and Swords Dance Toxicroak love having walls weakened. They also provide offensive synergy, as both can easily break Steel-types that tend to switch into Meloetta, which has to rely on Focus Blast to deal with them. Entry hazard support is very much appreciated, as this Meloetta set can force a lot of switches. Forretress can provide a wide range of entry hazards while being able to bring in Meloetta safely thanks to a slow Volt Switch, while Tentacruel can provide Toxic Spikes and Scald burns, both of which apply a ton of pressure on the opponent.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn allows Meloetta to gain easy momentum against common switch-ins, such as Blissey and Florges. Hyper Voice is a great STAB move that allows Meloetta to hit Pokemon behind Substitutes. Psychic is a nice STAB move as well that hits harder than Psyshock, although Psyshock still hits special walls harder. Trick can cripple slow walls, such as Snorlax or Forretress; however, Focus Blast provides Meloetta with a way to beat Steel- and Dark-types, such as Mega Aggron and Krookodile.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Meloetta to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Timid nature means Meloetta is not outsped by positive-natured maximum Speed Mega Aerodactyl or other Mega Evolutions such as Beedrill. A Choice Scarf is the obvious item, as it patches up Meloetta's average base 90 Speed stat, letting it outspeed the whole unboosted metagame.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slapping a Choice Scarf on Meloetta means it can be a decent revenge killer. This set should be brought in after a teammate has fainted to make sure Meloetta doesn't take unnecessary damage. Watch out for other Choice Scarf users, as most common ones, such as Mienshao and Infernape, still outspeed Meloetta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates wallbreakers, as it is more of a late-game cleaner than the other sets. Pokemon such as Entei and Darmanitan are good examples, as their Fire-type STAB moves allow them to roast Steel-types, which tend to wall Meloetta. This set also appreciates entry hazards removed, as it has no sort of recovery. Forretress and Tentacruel make for good partners, as the former is immune to Toxic Spikes and neutral to Stealth Rock while the latter absorbs Toxic Spikes and has Scald to spread burns. This set appreciates entry hazard support as well due to Meloetta being able to force switches easily. Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Nidoqueen can provide power while setting up Stealth Rock easily.</p>"

      "Cleric Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Perish Song allows Meloetta to provide stall with a way to beat setup Pokemon such as Reuniclus, which is not crippled by status thanks to its Magic Guard ability. Hyper Voice allows Meloetta to hit Pokemon behind Substitutes; however, Ghost-types are immune to Hyper Voice and can switch into it at any time. U-turn can be used to gain easy momentum. Heal Bell gives Meloetta a way to get rid of the team's status, and it can do so multiple times thanks to the switches Perish Song warrants. If you already have a cleric and opted for Hyper Voice in the second slot, U-turn can be used here, as it is useful for gaining momentum off of forced switches due to Perish Song. Knock Off gets rid of Leftovers and other useful items such as Nidoqueen's Life Orb. Toxic puts the opponent's Pokemon on a timer, while Thunder Wave allows Meloetta to cripple offensive Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs allow Meloetta to make use of its great 100 / 128 special bulk. A Calm nature is used to boost Meloetta's already excellent special bulk even further; however, a Careful nature can be used if you decide to opt for U-turn + Knock Off. Leftovers provides Meloetta with a form of passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used exclusively to check setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, Substitute + Calm Mind Cresselia, and other Pokemon that are otherwise major threats to stall teams. Try not to bring it in on any physical attacks, as even strong neutral hits will tend to cause some major damage to Meloetta.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set really appreciates Wish support so that it can continue tanking special hits, as it has no form of reliable recovery. Pokemon such as Alomomola, Sylveon, and Umbreon have decent physical Defense to complement Meloetta's special bulk, and each provides their own unique support. This set also appreciates entry hazard support, as it can force a lot of switches thanks to Perish Song. Pokemon such as Forretress and Chesnaught provide Spikes support to wear down the opponent's team quickly; Forretress can also remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set up two other entry hazards, Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Relic Song is needed to allow Meloetta to change from its Aria forme to its Pirouette forme. It also happens to have a 20% chance to put the foe to sleep thanks to Serene Grace. Close Combat is a great STAB move that allows Meloetta-P to get around special walls such as Blissey while hitting Steel-types, which normally wall Meloetta-A, hard. Return is the obligatory Normal-type STAB move; it gets perfect neutral coverage alongside Close Combat bar Ghost-types. Knock Off provides Meloetta-P with a way to hit Ghost-types and remove items from foes, crippling them for the rest of the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs are used to allow Meloetta's Pirouette forme to hit as hard as it can. 216 Speed EVs allow Meloetta to outspeed Jolly Heracross and Toxicroak in its Aria forme and Noivern in its Pirouette forme. The rest is dumped into Special Attack to allow Relic Song to hit a bit harder. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Meloetta's attacks and allows it to switch between moves. A Naive nature is preferred to not lower either of Meloetta's offenses while also allowing it to take common priority attacks in UU.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can surprise some of Meloetta's common checks and counters, such as Blissey and Snorlax, as it now has a super effective STAB move with which to get around these special walls. It also gains a boost to its Speed, outspeeding old threats such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Mienshao.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set appreciates entry hazard support, as Meloetta-P can force switches a lot easier thanks to its boost in Speed and different STAB combination. Pokemon such as Forretress and Tentacruel can set up and remove entry hazards to allow more switches for Meloetta. This set also likes the support of wallbreakers such as Entei, Conkeldurr and Life Orb Hydreigon, as they can easily wear down common walls that switch into Meloetta. Entei is great in particular, as it can spread burns thanks to its access to Sacred Fire.</p>"

  "Chesnaught": {
    "overview": "<p>Chesnaught is one of the best defensive Spikers in the tier. It boasts a base 122 Defense stat and has access to support moves such as Leech Seed and Spiky Shield, letting it take on many physical threats very well. Bulletproof makes it immune to moves such as Sludge Bomb that would normally put a big dent into it, allowing it to shut down threats such as Roserade without Hidden Power Fire and Chandelure locked into Shadow Ball. All those aside, Chesnaught is slow and has a poor Special Defense stat, so many decently fast special attackers can threaten it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be run to wear down opposing walls and rack up serious residual damage in conjunction with Leech Seed. Stone Edge hits incoming Flying-types such as Crobat that would normally have a safe switch into Chesnaught, as well as hitting Fire-type switch-ins harder. Earthquake also hits all the Fire-types in the tier except for Rotom-H while hitting Steel-types, which is useful if you are not running Drain Punch. Super Fang is handy to wear Pokemon down at a faster rate, especially opposing walls. Chesnaught's Attack stat is reasonably good, so it can also make good use of an offensive Spiker set. When its Attack is maximized and it is holding a Life Orb, Chesnaught is able to severely damage one of its biggest counters in Crobat, OHKOing it after Stealth Rock. An offensive set with Bulk Up or Swords Dance to pressurise defensive teams is definitely viable as well. Chesnaught also has Belly Drum in its movepool, but does not have the Speed or the priority to utilize it effectively without the proper support.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types resist both of the commonly run offensive moves on Chesnaught and can threaten it out with a 4x super effective move. Crobat in particular can Defog freely when switching into any of Chesnaught's moves except Taunt and Roar.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types, such as Darmanitan, Chandelure, and Entei, threaten Chesnaught with their STAB moves. Chandelure in particular is a threat, as it resists one of Chesnaught's STAB types and is immune to the other. Frailer Fire-types such as Darmanitan need to be careful of getting worn down by Leech Seed, Spiky Shield, and Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types are immune to Leech Seed, so they can be a pain to deal with. Shaymin can hit Chesnaught hard with Air Slash, Psychic, or Dazzling Gleam, while Trevenant can take both of Chesnaught's STAB moves and burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Chesnaught does not mind paralysis, but it loathes burns and poison. Chesnaught also has no way of getting rid of status ailments on its own, so both will gradually wear it down. Toxic poison makes it unable to stay in for too long at a time, while burns reduce its offensive presence.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Most of Chesnaught's viable moves are support ones. After it is Taunted, the opponent usually gets a free switch into a Pokemon that resists its common offensive moves, such as Crobat.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: With a physically defensive spread, Chesnaught is frail on the special side, so avoid letting it take special attacks. Even with a specially defensive spread, strong special attacks severely damage it.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is very important, as it is one of the main reasons to use Chesnaught. It takes advantage of Chesnaught's bulk to set up entry hazards. The second moveslot is a toss-up between two forms of recovery. Leech Seed gives more passive recovery while wearing foes down. Synthesis, on the other hand, gives Chesnaught a method of reliable recovery. Spiky Shield allows you to scout for what the opposing Pokemon is going to do as well as gain more Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery. This also damages foes that try to hit Chesnaught physically. An option over Spiky Shield is Roar, which prevents Chesnaught from being setup fodder for some Pokemon, especially those that typically carry Substitute. The last moveslot depends on which offensive move you prefer. You could run Drain Punch for a reliable Fighting-type STAB move that also gets more recovery, or you could opt for Wood Hammer, a more powerful Grass-type STAB move with the drawback of recoil damage. Finally, Taunt is a viable option that prevents slower Pokemon such as Empoleon and Swampert from getting Stealth Rock up as well as preventing Empoleon from Defogging away your entry hazards. It also stops Trevenant from burning Chesnaught and Blissey from using any of its support moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs with an Impish nature maximize Chesnaught's physical bulk, taking advantage of its naturally high Defense stat. Leftovers is run to give more passive recovery, especially in conjunction with Spiky Shield and Leech Seed should you choose to run them. Rocky Helmet is also a good item, as it allows Chesnaught to punish physical attackers that it switches into. Bulletproof should be run 100% of the time, as it allows Chesnaught to take on Pokemon that would normally threaten it, such as Roserade without Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try going for Spikes or a Leech Seed on predicted switches to gradually wear the opponent's Pokemon down. If you choose to run Synthesis, use it whenever Chesnaught is getting low on HP so that it can constantly take on physical attackers and set up more layers of Spikes. Use Spiky Shield at times to scout what the foe is going to do, especially those that run a Choice item. If you are able to predict a switch into a Pokemon that is relatively safe such as a Crobat or a Gligar, use Roar to rack up entry hazard damage on opposing Pokemon while not allowing them to Defog for free. It also can be used against Pokemon such as Suicune that try to use Chesnaught as setup fodder. Do note that although Chesnaught is very physically bulky, it can get worn down easily by strong physical attacks such as Mienshao's High Jump Kick, especially if you are not running Synthesis.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Empoleon is a good partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock while Chesnaught sets up Spikes. It also takes Psychic-, Flying- and Poison-type moves that are aimed at Chesnaught. Clerics such as Florges, Vaporeon, and Blissey can help get rid of the status ailments that Chesnaught typically has trouble with while at the same time sponging special hits that target Chesnaught's low Special Defense stat. If you choose not to run Synthesis, Chesnaught is easily worn down, so a Rapid Spin user is appreciated to get rid of entry hazards on your side of the field.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes take advantage of Chesnaught's bulk to set up entry hazards. Leech Seed gives additional passive recovery while wearing opposing Pokemon down. If you would rather opt for a more reliable form of recovery, Synthesis is your best option. Spiky Shield damages foes that try to hit Chesnaught physically and allows you to scout for what the opposing Pokemon is going to do and gain more Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery. Roar can be run over Spiky Shield to prevent Chesnaught from being setup fodder for certain Pokemon, especially those that typically carry Substitute. The last moveslot depends on which offensive move you prefer. Drain Punch is a reliable Fighting-type STAB move that also gets more recovery, while Wood Hammer is a more powerful Grass-type STAB move with the drawback of recoil damage. Finally, Taunt is a viable option that prevents slower Pokemon such as Empoleon and Swampert from setting up Stealth Rock and prevents Empoleon from Defogging away your entry hazards. It also stops Trevenant from burning Chesnaught and Blissey from using any of its support moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature maximize Chesnaught's special bulk, giving it good mixed defenses, which allows it to more effectively check Hydreigon, Mega Blastoise, Roserade, and Mega Ampharos. Leftovers gives Chesnaught passive recovery, especially in conjunction with Spiky Shield and Leech Seed if you choose to run them. Always run Bulletproof to allow Chesnaught to take on more threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to set up Spikes or go for a Leech Seed on predicted switches to wear opposing Pokemon down. Use Synthesis to recover when at low HP to avoid being worn down. Use Spiky Shield at times to scout for what move the opposing Pokemon is going to use, which helps against Choice-locked Pokemon. Use Roar on predicted switches into Defoggers such as Crobat and Gligar to prevent them from Defogging for free. Using it against strong special attackers such as Chandelure as they come in is a good idea as well. Note that even with maximum HP and Special Defense investment, Chesnaught is not going to appreciate taking really powerful special hits, so avoid switching it directly into moves such as a Life Orb Hydreigon's Draco Meteor or a Chandelure, unless it is Choice-locked into anything but a Fire-type move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon can take Fire- and Ice-type attacks for Chesnaught. Vaporeon in particular is a good cleric to get rid of Chesnaught's status ailments, but you can also use other clerics such as Florges and Umbreon. Tentacruel has relatively good synergy with Chesnaught, is able to set up Toxic Spikes, and can Rapid Spin away opposing entry hazards.

      "Fast Taunt": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes takes advantage of Chesnaught's bulk to set up multiple layers. Taunt stops opposing Pokemon from using a variety of support moves, including Defog, entry hazard moves of their own, Wish, status moves, and setup. The third moveslot is up to preference. Leech Seed gets more passive recovery while wearing foes down, and Synthesis gives Chesnaught a method of reliable recovery. Roar prevents Chesnaught from being setup fodder for faster Pokemon, especially Substitute users, but limits Chesnaught's recovery to just Leftovers. On the last slot, Drain Punch is a good reliable Fighting-type STAB move that helps Chesnaught regain some HP lost. For more power, Wood Hammer is a fine option as a Grass-type STAB move at the cost of some recoil damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>172 Speed EVs are used to outspeed and Taunt uninvested Cresselia, Suicune, and Gligar, preventing the former two from setting up and the last from using Defog or Stealth Rock. It also stops all three of the aforementioned Pokemon from recovering back any HP lost. HP is then maxed out, and the remaining EVs are invested into Defense to still maintain good physical bulk. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 92 Spe can be used to outspeed up to uninvested Florges while still outspeeding standard Jellicent, Vaporeon, Umbreon, and Alomomola. Speed can be further invested in to outspeed specially defensive Roserade and defensive Arcanine, requiring 228 and 252 Speed EVs, respectively. A Jolly nature with 228 Speed EVs can also be utilized to outspeed 24 Speed Tentacruel. Leftovers is run to give more passive recovery, which is especially effective if you are running Leech Seed. Bulletproof is chosen to grant immunity to moves such as Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb that Chesnaught would normally not appreciate getting hit by.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try setting up Spikes or go for a Leech Seed on predicted switches to wear opposing Pokemon down. Use Synthesis to recover when Chesnaught does not have a lot of HP to avoid being worn down. If you choose to run Roar, use it on switches to fast Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Crobat and Tentacruel, respectively, to prevent entry hazard removal, as Taunt from Chesnaught cannot deal with these. Also, try to avoid revealing Taunt too early. It is best to use it when the foe is low on HP and needs to recover, or if setting up entry hazards or Defogging is an extremely obvious move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon can take Fire- and Ice-type attacks for Chesnaught. Vaporeon in particular is a good cleric to get rid of Chesnaught's status ailments, but other clerics such as Florges and Umbreon also work as partners. Tentacruel has relatively good synergy with Chesnaught, is able to set up Toxic Spikes, and can Rapid Spin away opposing entry hazards. Both have to be careful of strong Psychic-type attacks, though. A teammate that can handle fast Defog users, particularly Crobat, would be handy, as Crobat can easily threaten Chesnaught out. Rhyperior is a good partner for that reason and is also able to set up Stealth Rock alongside Chesnaught's Spikes. Setup sweepers such as Lucario appreciate Chesnaught's Spikes-stacking and prevention of a slow Defog. They also benefit from walls being unable to recover back any HP lost.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Fletchinder is pretty limited in what it can do, but it is very unique with what it does in the UU tier. With priority Acrobatics, the strongest priority in the tier, and access to Swords Dance, Fletchinder makes for an excellent revenge killer and late-game cleaner. That being said, Fletchinder is extremely frail and 4x weak to Stealth Rock, which makes it a bit tricky to use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fletchinder can run Overheat to hit Mega Aggron and Forretress for super effective damage. U-turn can also be used to keep some momentum from the switches Fletchinder will force against Fighting-types. As a last-ditch effort, Fletchinder can use Tailwind to ensure the rest of its team will have a Speed boost for a few turns. Finally, Taunt can also be utilized to stallbreak better.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune take minimal damage from Acrobatics and can retaliate with a super effective Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Mega Ampharos and Rotom-H resist Acrobatics and can OHKO Fletchinder back with Electric-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Fletchinder's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock really discourages it from switching in when the entry hazard is on the field.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While they don't appreciate being burned, Rock-types such as Mega Aerodactyl and Diancie resist Acrobatics and can retaliate with a 4x super effective Rock-type move.</p> <p><strong>Dedicated Physical Walls</strong>: Dedicated physical walls such as Porygon2 and Cresselia can eat up a hit and use Toxic or attack Fletchinder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Priority Users</strong>: Faster priority users such as Entei and Lucario can revenge kill Fletchinder after a bit of prior damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fletchinder has a very shallow and predictable movepool and has to rely on Acrobatics for damage. Thankfully, it has access to Swords Dance, which helps to improve its damage output, as well as having support moves such as Roost and Will-O-Wisp, which allow Fletchinder to stay around longer despite its poor defenses and 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Will-O-Wisp also helps get chip damage on some of Fletchinder's checks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>In order to do as much damage as possible, Fletchinder needs an Adamant nature with 252 EVs. With priority Flying-type moves due to Gale Wings, Fletchinder doesn't need to run too much Speed, but 152 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed and burn foes such as Adamant Honchkrow. The remaining EVs go into HP to provide some more bulk. Because its only attacking move is Acrobatics, Fletchinder runs no item in order to maximize the damage output of Acrobatics. An EV spread tweak can be made to make Fletchinder take resisted hits better by giving it 248 HP EVs and dropping the Speed EVs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Fletchinder isn't a Pokemon that can sweep on its own. To use this Pokemon effectively, you should be eliminating its counters throughout the game and keeping it healthy for the late-game. Despite being frail, it will usually have an opportunity to set up a Swords Dance, which will allow it to deal heavy damage to anything that isn't a check. Outside of being a late-game cleaner, Fletchinder can be useful throughout a match by revenge killing fast, weakened Pokemon with a priority Acrobatics.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>With average initial Attack and only Acrobatics and Will-O-Wisp to inflict damage, Fletchinder needs some team support. Powerful Choice Band users such as Heracross and Krookodile can significantly weaken dedicated physical walls such as Cresselia and Swampert, which normally switch into Fletchinder. Pokemon that can take out bulky Water-types, such as Celebi, Whimsicott, Heliolisk, and Toxicroak, really aid Fletchinder in sweeping. With a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, Fletchinder likes entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Forretress, Empoleon, Tentacruel, and Mega Blastoise. Also, any Pokemon that benefits from having Fighting-types eliminated, such as Hydreigon or Snorlax, is a great teammate for Fletchinder.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With an excellent defensive typing, a great set of resistances, reliable recovery in Synthesis and Wish, and a solid supporting movepool, Florges has long been a staple in the UU tier. Boasting solid defensive stats, albeit a rather poor base Defense, Florges also has an often-overlooked Special Attack stat and a good offensive STAB move in Moonblast. However, Florges grants a free switch to several threatening Pokemon such as various Steel- and Fire-types. It is also setup fodder for many common setup sweepers and often falls victim to common stallbreaking tactics such as Trick and Taunt. In addition, Florges's abilities have no use in the singles format. Finally, it faces heavy competition from Sylveon, who passes larger Wishes and hits significantly harder thanks to access to Pixilate Hyper Voice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Florges has access to a decent coverage move in Psychic, which can defeat Poison-types such as Nidoqueen and Roserade and can deal considerable damage to Fire-types. Florges also has access to Energy Ball to hit Water- and Ground-types harder or can use Hidden Power Fire to deal decent damage to Steel-types barring Empoleon, especially Forretress, which commonly uses Florges's presence on the field to set up entry hazards. A combination of Toxic and Worry Seed can be used to defeat opposing walls and bulky setup sweepers.</p> <p>With a naturally high Special Attack, Florges can run an offensive Calm Mind set with two or three attacks. However, its low Speed and poor uninvested physical bulk prevent this set from being too effective. Florges can use a Choice Scarf to get surprise KOs on faster Pokemon such as Crobat and Infernape; a Modest nature should be used over a Timid nature on such a set, as the latter doesn't let Florges outspeed anything relevant. Florges can also run Choice Specs with the aforementioned coverage moves to deal major damage to most switch-ins.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Fairy</strong>: Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types can take advantage of common Florges sets and immediately threaten it out. Notable Pokemon that have little to fear are Roserade, Nidoking, Mega Beedrill, Entei, Darmanitan, Empoleon, and Mega Aggron.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Even with maximum investment in Defense, Florges still struggles to switch into many neutral physical attacks, such as those from Choice Band Krookodile and Life Orb Infernape.</p> <p><strong>Boosting Pokemon</strong>: RestTalk Pokemon such as Snorlax and Suicune can use Florges as setup fodder, as even Calm Mind variants fail to beat them. Nasty Plot users such as Mega Houndoom, Porygon-Z, and Celebi can all beat support Florges.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Support Florges cannot perform its role against Taunt users and Calm Mind Florges also falls to some common Taunt users, such as Crobat.</p> <p><strong>Phazing</strong>: Phazers such as Swampert and Mega Aggron prevent Wish Florges from passing its Wishes to the desired recipient and Calm Mind Florges from setting up freely.</p>",

      "Defensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Florges is a decent Wish passer and is usually able to reliably heal itself and its teammates with Wish. Synthesis is Florges's main niche over Sylveon, allowing it to reliably restore its own health against phazers such as Swampert. Protect is an option over Synthesis that enables Florges to safely receive its own Wish unless it gets phazed by Roar or Whirlwind; it is also important for scouting movesets and Choiced attackers and grants Florges additional Leftovers recovery. Moonblast is reasonably strong coming off Florges's naturally high Special Attack and is able to OHKO several offensive Pokemon, such as Hydreigon, Mega Absol, and Mienshao. Aromatherapy removes status from Florges and its teammates, while Toxic can be used instead to wear down Fire-type switch-ins and bulkier Pokemon. However, many of Florges's switch-ins are immune to Toxic because of their typing, such as Bronzong and Nidoqueen, or can heal themselves of status, such as Blissey and opposing Florges.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Defense and HP along with a Bold nature allows Florges to easily take attacks from the likes of Mienshao, Krookodile, and Heracross. With Florges' base Special Defense stat already being so high, it isn't necessary to invest in it. If it better suits your team though, a more specially defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to more reliably counter threatening special attackers, such as Kyurem, Mega Blastoise, Heliolisk, and Mega Ampharos. Leftovers lets Florges heal passively without relying on Wish and works well in tandem with Protect. Neither of Florges's abilities is useful, so either one can be used.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Protect should be used to scout Choiced Pokemon or possibly threatening coverage moves such as Iron Tail on Hydreigon. However, Florges must be wary of Pokemon that can take advantage of the free turn granted by Protect by boosting or using Substitute. If Synthesis is preferred, it should always be used instead of Wish to heal Florges itself.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Florges set works best on balanced teams and can make up part of the defensive backbone that these teams require. Pokemon that can check Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types work well as partners; bulky Water-types can fulfill this role effectively. Swampert in particular is a great teammate as it has great defensive synergy with Florges, provides Stealth Rock, and can phaze setup sweepers that Florges hates, such as CurseLax, while Florges supports Swampert in return with Wish and Aromatherapy. Krookodile is another great teammate that can beat many foes that threaten Florges, such as Nidoqueen and Roserade. Mega Aggron can also support Florges with Stealth Rock and phazing while standing up to threats such as Crobat and Mega Beedrill.</p>"

Finally, Aromatherapy heals Florges of status and makes Florges extremely hard for defensively oriented teams to take down; it also provides useful cleric support for the rest of Florges's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Defense and HP along with a Bold nature allows Florges to easily take attacks from the likes of Mienshao, Krookodile, and Heracross; no EVs need to be placed into Special Defense because it will be boosted by Calm Mind. Thus, Florges is very difficult to revenge kill after it sets up thanks to its heavy investment in Defense coupled with its boosted Special Defense. If it better suits your team though, a more specially defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 224 Def / 32 SpD with a Calm nature can be used. Leftovers provides Florges with passive healing as it boosts, allowing it to use Synthesis less frequently.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set fits well on bulky offensive teams as a check to various attackers as well as an excellent win condition against stall, which struggles to take Florges down without a setup sweeper of its own, such as CroCune. Florges should not attempt to play around Pokemon such as Toxic Blissey and defensive Arcanine, which can both wear Florges down easily with repeated statuses and attacks, forcing Florges to use up its limited Aromatherapy and Synthesis PP. Instead, Florges should set up on non-boosting special attackers, such as Mega Blastoise and even slower variants of Life Orb Nidoqueen, as well as passive Pokemon, such as Gligar, Alomomola, and even Gyro Ball Forretress. However, Florges struggles against most opposing setup sweepers, such as CroCune, Calm Mind Cresselia, and CurseLax, and should not attempt to beat them one-on-one.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Florges needs most Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types weakened or removed before it can set up safely. Krookodile is an excellent partner, as it can trap Bronzong and check Poison-types such as Roserade and Toxicroak, while appreciating Florges's ability to switch into Fighting-types. Swampert is also a great partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock to pressure opposing Fire-types, check Fire- and Steel-types, and phaze opposing setup sweepers that can beat Florges. Toxic Spikes is a great option to pair with Florges that forces opposing Pokemon such as Alomomola and Arcanine to recover frequently, granting Florges more setup opportunities.</p>"

  "Pangoro": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to moves such as Knock Off, Drain Punch, and Swords Dance, Pangoro has a chance to shine in the ORAS UU metagame. The panda boasts a great offensive typing combined with a very high base Attack, good coverage, and great utility in Parting Shot. Pangoro's extremely useful ability Iron Fist helps it tear through even the bulkiest of physical walls, and it has Scrappy and Mold Breaker as decent alternative options. Despite its fantastic wallbreaking prowess, Pangoro is set back by its mediocre Speed combined with a lack of access to priority moves. It also has weaknesses to common offensive types in UU and only a few resistances to take advantage of. However, Pangoro is still excellent at its job of breaking through defensive Pokemon and should be considered to perform this role on teams that require it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Substitute and either of Focus Punch with Leftovers and Drain Punch with Life Orb can be effective against many playstyles and gives Pangoro good survivability while still maintaining its incredible power. Sky Uppercut is a stronger Iron Fist-boosted alternative to Drain Punch and doesn't have negative side effects. Facade is an option to alleviate burns to a degree, but Pangoro doesn't have much room for it on any of its sets.</p> <p>As far as coverage goes, Earthquake is available to get a stronger hit on Poison-types such as Nidoqueen, Tentacruel, and particularly Toxicroak, which resists all of Pangoro's other commonly run moves. Stone Edge can be used exclusively to KO Crobat without Stealth Rock damage, and Ice Punch can be used to OHKO Gligar. Finally, Bulk Up is an alternative to Swords Dance that makes Pangoro harder to revenge kill but less effective at destroying stall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Gligar</strong>: This is one of the only Pokemon that can take any two consecutive hits from Pangoro, barring Ice Punch. A slower Pangoro, however, can beat Gligar by using its Fighting-type move on the turn Gligar uses Roost.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: If Pangoro fails to KO any Fairy-type, it will be OHKOed without fail. Defensive Whimsicott in particular can outspeed and OHKO all variants of Pangoro and can easily switch into any move except Gunk Shot. Defensive Fairy-types such as Sylveon counter Pangoro variants without Poison coverage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Its low Speed and weaknesses to Flying and Fighting leave Pangoro vulnerable to many common Pokemon, especially because it isn't extraordinarily bulky. Common checks of this kind include Mienshao, Infernape, Crobat, and Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types that can live two Knock Offs or one Hammer Arm and threaten back with Scald force Choice Band Pangoro out. However, these Pokemon risk getting set up on by Swords Dance Lum Berry variants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boosted by Iron Fist, Hammer Arm is Pangoro's strongest STAB move and is able to deal huge damage, even to Pokemon that resist it. Knock Off provides excellent coverage and an additional STAB move to nail certain Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Crobat and Nidoqueen. It can also cripple switch-ins, especially those with Eviolite, such as Gligar. Gunk Shot is the strongest option to hit Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Florges, which resist both of Pangoro's STAB moves; it is powerful enough to OHKO every Fairy-type in the tier after Stealth Rock damage besides Granbull, which is 2HKOed. Poison Jab is a more accurate coverage option, but misses out on these important OHKOs and 2HKOs. Parting Shot can be used in the last slot to gain momentum and weaken offensive switch-ins, bringing in another member of your team safely. Drain Punch can also be used as a more reliable Fighting-type STAB move that won't drop Pangoro's Speed and can restore Pangoro's HP if it gets worn down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature is used to provide maximum power output and allows Pangoro to get the OHKOs and 2HKOs mentioned previously. Max Speed is used to outspeed every defensive Pokemon, including faster ones such as CroCune, Cresselia, and Gligar. Using a Choice Band ensures an OHKO or 2HKO against almost everything in the tier with the appropriate move, while a Life Orb allows Pangoro to switch moves at the cost of some power and recoil damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Knock Off against Pokemon wielding Leftovers or Eviolite early on in a game to give Pangoro a better chance at breaking through physically defensive Pokemon such as Gligar and Suicune on the next switch. Predicting a Fairy-type or Fighting-resistant Pokemon to switch into Pangoro early in the game and using the appropriate coverage move allows Pangoro to spam Hammer Arm after these Pokemon are removed. Play carefully around Hammer Arm's Speed drop; Pangoro can outspeed Pokemon such as Suicune and Chesnaught before the first usage of Hammer Arm, but not after.</p> <p>Against offense, make use of Pangoro's key resistance to Dark, but don't let its item be removed by Knock Off when facing defensively oriented teams. Parting Shot should be used aggressively against faster teams to allow other Pokemon that are better against offense, such as Mega Swampert, to set up more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is necessary to get KOs on Crobat, Aromatisse, and Granbull and helps against others such as Suicune. Pangoro appreciates Pokemon that resist Flying and Fairy and can be relied on if you predict wrongly, fail to KO a foe, or miss an attack. Sweepers and cleaners can take advantage of Pangoro's ability to cripple or remove defensive Pokemon of almost any kind with its attacks and weaken offensive Pokemon with Parting Shot. Pangoro is otherwise mediocre against offense, so team members that do well against the playstyle are needed.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set makes use of Swords Dance to boost Pangoro's Attack to insane levels. Drain Punch is a good STAB move that is boosted by Iron Fist and lets Pangoro recover damage accumulated while switching in and setting up while also making it harder for defensive Pokemon to wear it down. Knock Off is Pangoro's other STAB move, providing excellent coverage in tandem with Drain Punch, and lets it cripple foes by removing their items. After a Swords Dance, Pangoro's Gunk Shot OHKOes every Fairy-type, including Granbull, after Stealth Rock damage. Poison Jab can also be used to OHKO every Fairy-type besides Granbull with very little prior damage and has better accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack is used for obvious reasons, while the given Speed investment allows Pangoro to outspeed everything up to uninvested Nidoqueen. The extra bulk allows Pangoro to set up a little more easily and is helpful against weaker attacks from Pokemon like Gligar and Alomomola. Maximum Speed investment can also be used to outspeed Cresselia, Gligar, and Suicune. A Lum Berry lets Pangoro set up more easily on bulky Water-types with Scald, carriers of Toxic, and Body Slam Snorlax. Iron Fist is preferred to power up Drain Punch; however, Mold Breaker cancels out abilities such as Quagsire's Unaware, Mega Aggron's Filter, and Donphan's Sturdy. An alternative STAB move such as Hammer Arm can be used with Mold Breaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pangoro finds easy setup opportunities against specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Umbreon; after setting up, Pangoro can proceed to decimate the stall teams these Pokemon are frequently found on. Faster Pokemon such as Crobat that threaten to KO Pangoro in the middle of a sweep must be eliminated. While fantastic at breaking down defensive teams, Swords Dance Pangoro is near dead-weight against offense. It should be used to simply remove items with Knock Off and as fodder.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pangoro's team members must be able to reliably deal with offense and faster teams in general. In particular, fast Flying- and Fighting-types must be checked. Mega Aerodactyl does this well in addition to performing well against offense. Pangoro can lure and knock out defensive Fairy-types, clearing the way for teammates like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Mienshao.</p>"

  "Doublade": {
    "overview": "<p>Doublade has an amazing base 150 Defense stat which, coupled with Eviolite, means it can take a lot of physical hits, even super effective ones. Although Doublade's Steel / Ghost typing gives it weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Fire, Dark, and Ground, it has many resistances and superb physical bulk to make up for that. Doublade also has a great base 110 Attack stat which can be further boosted thanks to its access to Swords Dance. It also has access to priority in Shadow Sneak, allowing Doublade to beat out revenge killers. However, Doublade's base 49 Special Defense stat means that even resisted special hits are going to take a chunk out of its health. Doublade's base 35 Speed also leaves it outsped by common walls that it may want to set up on, such as Umbreon and Gligar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive set can be used to allow for better setup opportunities for Doublade; however, Doublade will still faint to neutral special hits and the bulk is usually not worth the loss in power. RestTalk provides Doublade with a way of recovering health and allows it to not be setup fodder while asleep. This set, however, would be hard-pressed to run what it needs to, as it would lose out on either boosting Doublade's decent base 110 Attack with Swords Dance or having coverage in the form of Sacred Sword or Iron Head. Toxic is the only useful move Doublade can learn that takes advantage of No Guard; however, Doublade already has enough of a hard time choosing moves, and Toxic doesn't really help it beat what it wants to, which are bulky Steel-types, which are immune to Toxic. Pursuit can be nice for trapping purposes against Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat; however, Doublade would much rather set up a Swords Dance on the switch to hit the switch-in with a +2 Shadow Sneak or Iron Head.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Mega Aggron and Swampert can tank Doublade's attacks and proceed to cripple it with Thunder Wave in the former's case or Scald in the latter's case.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune can not only tank most of Doublade's hits but also can set up Calm Minds on Doublade and threaten it with a burn from a STAB Scald, rendering Doublade ineffective.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Nidoqueen are able to hit Doublade on its weaker defense.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Without an Aromatherapy partner, Doublade doesn't like burns from the likes of Scald and Will-O-Wisp, as burns halve its Attack stat.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Pokemon which Doublade tends to wall otherwise, such as Mienshao and Heracross, often run Knock Off. Doublade is not only weak to Knock Off but will also lose its Eviolite, thus losing a lot of its bulk.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Doublade to become a great wincon, becoming a threat very quickly. Shadow Sneak is a great STAB move that bypasses Doublade's bad base 35 Speed stat thanks to it having +1 priority. Iron Head is a more reliable STAB move to hit slower Pokemon such as Florges harder while Gyro Ball hits foes such as Crobat harder, albeit with fewer PP. Sacred Sword allows Doublade to hit Dark-types harder along with providing great neutral coverage alongside Doublade's Shadow Sneak. Shadow Claw can be used instead, as it gains STAB, provides a stronger neutral hit on Water- and Electric-types, and provides decent neutral coverage with Iron Head.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs allow Doublade to hit as hard as possible. 240 HP EVs minimize Stealth Rock and burn damage while the rest is dumped into Special Defense. An Adamant nature is used with Iron Head, but a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs are necessary with Gyro Ball to allow it to hit as hard as possible against faster threats. Eviolite is used to allow Doublade to survive any physical hit, even super effective ones, alongside weaker special hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to set up late-game when opposing Pokemon are weakened enough to faint to a +2 Shadow Sneak. Doublade can set up on almost all physical attackers thanks to its amazing physical bulk and nice resistances, so Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat are ideal setup bait for Doublade, as even a switch-in is not going to like taking a hit from +2 Doublade.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Doublade appreciates wallbreakers such as Darmanitan and Mienshao, as both can break Steel-types that tend to wall Doublade. Wish support is necessary, as Doublade has no form of recovery outside of RestTalk. Florges is a great partner and forms a nice Steel + Fairy core while also providing Aromatherapy support, meaning Doublade doesn't have to worry about being crippled by status ailments. Entry hazard support is also necessary to wear down Doublade's common checks. Tentacruel and Chesnaught are good partners, as Tentacruel can spread burns with Scald and pressure the rest of the team with Toxic Spikes while Chesnaught has Fighting-type STAB moves to hurt Steel-types and can wear them down with Leech Seed and Spikes. Trick Room support from Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Slowking allows Doublade to outspeed foes with base 35 Speed and higher and hit them before it gets hit. This improves Doublade's chances of retaining its Eviolite against the many powerful Knock Off users in the tier, such as Krookodile and Absol, while applying major pressure to the opponent's team.</p>"

  "Aromatisse": {
    "overview": "<p>As a Fairy-type cleric, Aromatisse faces stiff competition for a teamslot, as Florges has greater Speed, power, and special bulk. However, Florges lacks Aromatisse's raw physical bulk and HP, which allows it to survive attacks from Choice Band Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Heracross more comfortably. Granbull is another pure Fairy-type that is able to survive the same physical onslaughts thanks to its access to Intimidate. However, it lacks Wish, making it unable to provide recovery to its teammates. Aromatisse also stands out with its unique ability in Aroma Veil, which grants immunity to Taunt and Encore. This ability comes in handy against common threats such as Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <p>However, Aromatisse has low Speed, average offensive stats, and only above-average defensive stats for a wall. As a result, it falls prey to common wallbreakers that resist Fairy-type moves, such as Choice Band Entei, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking. In addition, its reliance on Wish to recover health gives it a hard time against phazers, many of which have the bulk to take a Moonblast. Altogether, while Aromatisse does have a somewhat shallow movepool and a few glaring faults, it makes for a very viable choice as a wall on balanced and stall teams alike.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thanks to Aromatisse's immunity to Taunt, it is able to make great use of the support options it has, including Trick Room and dual screens. It can also make use of Calm Mind to threaten some stall teams, although Florges is usually better for that role. Toxic can be used to cripple switch-ins, but Steel- and Poison-types are both immune to it and commonly switch into Aromatisse. Psychic can be used to nail Poison-types such as Nidoking and Crobat. Disable can be annoying for certain foes, but overall it is extremely situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Roserade, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Tentacruel can all easily switch into Moonblasts and proceed to either set up entry hazards or demolish Aromatisse with high-powered STAB Poison-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Darmanitan, Entei, and Chandelure are easily able to switch into Aromatisse and break past its above-average defenses. Chandelure in particular can use Substitute and set up Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Doublade can easily come in on a resisted Moonblast and threaten Aromatisse out with a powerful Steel-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: While Aromatisse is meant to be a solid counter to Fighting-types as well as Dragons, many of them are known to carry surprise coverage for Fairies. Notable examples of this are Iron Tail Goodra and Poison Jab Mienshao.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Because its only viable spread in UU is a physically defensive spread, Aromatisse takes massive damage from strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Sylveon and Mega Blastoise.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Due to its low damage output, Aromatisse is setup fodder for bulky setup attackers such as Suicune and Snorlax, which can proceed to Calm Mind or Curse up to +6 and inflict big damage.</p>",

Moonblast is used as a STAB attack that is able to OHKO Haxorus after Stealth Rock. Aromatherapy provides further team support by removing any status effects.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs maximize physical bulk, as that's the only reason Aromatisse should be used over Florges. Leftovers gives Aromatisse some passive recovery. Aroma Veil gives Aromatisse immunity to Taunt and Encore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aromatisse's resistance to Dark-, Bug-, and Fighting-type attacks lets it switch into threats such as Mega Absol, Heracross, and Mienshao. Its Dragon-type immunity allows it to check threats such as Hydreigon and Haxorus, as they are not able to use their most powerful moves, Draco Meteor and Outrage, respectively. Wish in conjunction with Protect is a means of reliable recovery for Aromatisse and its teammates, but it should be used wisely, as it could give the opponent a free turn to set up. Be wary of phazers, as they can force Aromatisse out through Protect and ruin its Wish recovery.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert can switch into powerful Fire-types such as Entei and Darmanitan, which threaten Aromatisse. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Snorlax can reliably take hits from Poison-type special attackers such as Nidoqueen and Roserade, and in return Aromatisse can deal with Heracross and Machamp. Grounded Poison-types such as Nidoqueen and Nidoking are great to soak up Toxic Spikes which Aromatisse hates switching in on.

  "Slurpuff": {
    "overview": "<p>Slurpuff holds a niche in the UU metagame as a deadly late-game cleaner thanks to its access to Unburden and Belly Drum, which allow it to become a massive threat in one turn by giving it immense power and Speed. With the combination of these, Slurpuff can become a near-unstoppable sweeper after its counters, such as Forretress, have been removed or severely weakened. It also has a useful defensive typing and manageable bulk, which help it set up on many common Pokemon in UU such as Hydreigon, Heracross, and Mienshao. However, due to the nature of Unburden, Slurpuff becomes a do-or-die Pokemon after setting up: it must sweep on the spot, or it will become deadweight. Slurpuff also has trouble setting up, as Belly Drum requires using up a significant amount of HP. As such, Slurpuff is a Pokemon that must receive support to function at its best.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set that runs Dazzling Gleam, Flamethrower, and Surf is usable to rely on large coverage to sweep. However, the set takes a lot of time to have Slurpuff become a threat and relies on the foe not OHKOing Slurpuff to activate Unburden. Draining Kiss could also be used in such a set as a form of recovery, but it is depressingly weak. Wish is a usable option to allow Slurpuff to act as a support Pokemon, but it is outclassed in a defensive role by Sylveon and Florges. Light Screen can be used, but Slurpuff has little time for such a move. There are lesser, unorthodox, options such as Thunderbolt, Energy Ball, and Safeguard, but outside of dealing with bulky Water-types, these moves generally have little use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bronzong, Mega Aggron, and Forretress are bulky enough to take even a Drain Punch from Slurpuff and either remove Slurpuff from play with Gyro Ball or Heavy Slam or simply force it out. Doublade falls into a similar boat, being able to shrug off practically anything Slurpuff can throw at it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Entei can revenge kill Slurpuff with a Choice Band Extreme Speed. Lucario can also make use of Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch, while Fletchinder can revenge kill Slurpuff with Gale Wings Acrobatics.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: With Stealth Rock and Spikes up, Slurpuff can easily be damaged to a point where it will have immense trouble setting up. Entry hazard damage also makes Slurpuff much more vulnerable to priority.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Overwhelming Slurpuff with repeated powerful attacks or extreme power will prevent it from setting up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum maximizes Slurpuff's Attack stat to massive levels and also lowers Slurpuff's HP to the point where Slurpuff consumes its Sitrus Berry, thus healing its HP and activating Unburden. Play Rough hits anything that doesn't resist it for extreme damage after a boost. Return serves as an option to hit Roserade, Crobat, and Nidoqueen hard while generally being more reliable than Play Rough. Substitute, however, allows Slurpuff to avoid status and set up Belly Drum more easily. Drain Punch hits Empoleon and weakened Mega Aggron hard while also providing Slurpuff a form of recovery, allowing it to heal off damage sustained from Belly Drum. Aromatherapy is an option over either Return or Substitute to allow Slurpuff to remove status from itself while supporting its team in the process if the need arises.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is needed in order to maximize Slurpuff's sweeping potential while a Jolly nature and 228 Speed EVs allow Slurpuff to have enough Speed to outrun Choice Scarf Infernape after an Unburden boost, and also outspeed Kingdra under weather. The remaining HP EVs give Slurpuff an even number of HP to activate Unburden after a single Belly Drum. An Adamant nature provides a bit more power, but the difference in damage output is minimal, as Slurpuff performs optimally late-game. Sitrus Berry is the best way to activate Unburden and also heals half of the damage Slurpuff sustains by using Belly Drum. Unburden doubles Slurpuff's Speed after it consumes its Sitrus Berry, turning it into an extremely fast sweeper.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slurpuff is a late-game cleaner; it should only attempt to sweep once its checks and counters, such as Mega Aggron, Entei, and Forretress, are either severely weakened or removed from play. Slurpuff will have a lot of difficulty setting up, so it is best advised to do so on slow defensive Pokemon such as Florges and Gligar. Make use of its good defensive typing to set up on threats such as Heracross and Mienshao effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slurpuff appreciates support from wallbreakers, such as Tyrantrum, Chandelure, and Entei, that can help to weaken or remove Slurpuff's counters, such as Entei and Mega Aggron. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Swampert, Chesnaught, and Froslass is very useful to weaken the opponent's team over the match so Slurpuff can effectively clean. Forretress can also provide entry hazard and Rapid Spin support, and it can also use a slow Volt Switch or Explosion to get Slurpuff into the battle safely.</p>"

  "Dragalge": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragalge's STAB moves, Draco Meteor and Sludge Wave, both have perfect coverage bar Steel-types, and the former even packs a huge Base Power of 130. Combined with Adaptability, which doubles the Base Power of Dragalge's STAB moves, this makes Dragalge a great wallbreaker. Dragalge's Draco Meteor, for reference, OHKOes standard Alomomola. Furthermore, Dragalge's great defensive typing and good bulk allow it to pivot into many attacks in the tier, such as Fire Blast and Scald, and then retaliate with ease. However, Dragalge's low Speed somewhat offsets this, as it will usually be taking a hit before it is able to deal damage. And while Dragalge has a good defensive typing, it is still susceptible to very common moves such as Ice Beam, Earthquake, and Psyshock. Dragalge is also susceptible to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, although it does absorb Toxic Spikes. Dragalge's main STAB move, Draco Meteor, drops its Special Attack by two stages, which can make it setup bait at times.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Assault Vest might seem like a good option for Dragalge due to its high Special Defense and reasonable power with Adaptability. However, this isn't the case, as Dragalge is worn down very quickly by entry hazards and its lack of natural recovery, and it still lacks a bit of power. Thunderbolt is an option for those who want a more reliable way to hit Suicune, although it does not provide much out of this due to Draco Meteor hitting other targets harder. A Life Orb is an option for those who do not want Dragalge to be setup bait, but Dragalge will still lack a bit of power that it has with Choice Specs and it is even worn down quicker due to entry hazards chipping away at its health. Shadow Ball can be used in the last slot to 2HKO Bronzong. Albeit a very gimmicky option, Venoshock is an option to take advantage of Toxic Spikes' poison. Lastly, a full defensive set is viable, as Dragalge has access to many moves such as Dragon Tail, Haze, and Scald. Poison Touch would be the chosen ability for this set to spread poison with Dragon Tail.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Dragalge is unable to break through multiple special walls in the tier such as Blissey and Cresselia. Dragalge will end up letting them use it as setup fodder or they'll set up as Dragalge switches out. Although Dragalge can use Draco Meteor and remove half of the foe's health, the foe will likely use some form of recovery and Dragalge is forced to switch after the Special Attack drop.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types are resistant to Dragalge's main STAB move and are completely immune to its secondary one, making them an easy switch-in. While Dragalge will usually pack Focus Blast, bulky Steel-types that are neutral to Focus Blast, such as Bronzong, can easily check it due to their high bulk and can either set up or attack. Even then, Focus Blast's accuracy is unreliable and makes it harder to spam it against even super effective targets.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are faster and have the type advantage over Dragalge such as Espeon and Krookodile are easy checks to Dragalge. They both outspeed Dragalge and can strike with a super effective STAB move. However, almost none of these Pokemon are able to switch into Dragalge, as they fear being hit with a STAB move.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Dragalge's most powerful STAB move, and when combined with Choice Specs is able to OHKO most Pokemon that don't resist it. Sludge Wave is Dragalge's secondary STAB move, and is much more reliable to use against frailer targets because it doesn't drop Dragalge's Special Attack. Sludge Bomb is an alternative option, however, as the small poison chance pressures most special walls and the power drop is negligible, although the ability to hit Chesnaught without dropping Dragalge's Special Attack is missed. Focus Blast provides coverage against Steel-types, which resist both of Dragalge's STAB moves. Dragon Pulse is a more reliable STAB move that doesn't drop Dragalge's Special Attack and allows it to deal more damage late-game. However, the power drop is notable and is only really the better choice for more reliability. However, one could opt for a Dragon Fang and Toxic Spikes due to the multitude of switches Dragalge forces while still having a high-powered Draco Meteor. Hydro Pump is an option to OHKO Rock- and Ground-types, but it doesn't do much outside of this. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Forretress and 2HKOes Bronzong after Stealth Rock damage. Dragon Tail with a Mild nature is also an option on sets running the Dragon Fang, as Dragalge will then lack the power to 2HKO Umbreon and other special walls, so it can instead deter their healing by forcing them out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Adaptability is the best ability on this set, as it allows Dragalge to function as a total nuke with its STAB moves. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Dragalge's Special Attack. 68 Speed EVs allow Dragalge to outspeed Relaxed Swampert so Dragalge can slam it with a Draco Meteor. The remaining EVs are put into HP to boost Dragalge's bulk and allow it to use its great defensive qualities to pivot into attacks better. Choice Specs boosts Dragalge's Special Attack even further, allowing it to hit harder. However, Dragon Fang must be used if Toxic Spikes is being run to ensure Dragalge can switch moves yet still retain the power with Draco Meteor. An alternative spread with 92 Speed EVs is an option to pressure Blissey, although Blissey will usually just recover off the damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set mainly functions as a wallbreaker. Most of the time, you'll usually just be using Draco Meteor to try and dent the foe or flat-out OHKO it. However, while using Draco Meteor is generally the best option, try to use it a bit sparingly if Sludge Wave can get the job done, due to Sludge Wave's lack of a Special Attack drop. Due to the amount of switches Dragalge forces, Dragalge can set up Toxic Spikes on to cripple the opponent's switch-ins. Dragalge's great defensive typing and good bulk allow it to tank many hits and pivot into special attacks that it resists. It is imperative that you use correct prediction when the opponent has an opposing Fairy- or Steel-type, as they can easily force Dragalge out if you don't correctly use Sludge Bomb or Focus Blast on the switch. However, this set is fairly easy to use, and it basically is just breaking through the foe with powerful attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even with Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire, Dragalge still struggles against fully invested Steel-types, such as Bronzong, due to their high special bulk. Choice Specs Magneton can trap these Pokemon and clear the path for Dragalge. Trick Room support is an option due to Dragalge's low Speed stat. Cresselia and Reuniclus have great defensive synergy with Dragalge, are both very bulky, and can reliably set it up. Porygon2 is an option, as it tanks most attacks that threaten Dragalge and can also set up Trick Room. Physical attackers that beat special walls are good partners for Dragalge. Darmanitan and Choice Band Entei incinerate special walls with their Fire-type STAB moves and even have decent offensive synergy with Dragalge. Dragalge is easily countered by Psychic-types such as Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Slowking, so having a partner that can easily Pursuit trap them such as Krookodile makes it easier for Dragalge to wallbreak. Wish support is greatly appreciated, as Dragalge easily gets worn down by entry hazards; Aromatisse and Alomomola both have great defensive synergy and pass enormous Wishes. Machamp is a great partner, as it lures in Fairy-types for Dragalge while Dragalge lures in Steel-types for Machamp, and they could both benefit from the aforementioned Trick Room.</p>"

  "Heliolisk": {
    "overview": "<p>With a base 109 Speed stat, Heliolisk outspeeds a lot of common Pokemon such as Infernape, Galvantula, and Cobalion. It also has a great movepool, boasting moves such as Surf, Grass Knot, Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, Hyper Voice, Volt Switch, and Dark Pulse. Heliolisk also has Dry Skin, which provides it an immunity to Water-type moves and therefore allows it to threaten a multitude of Water-type Pokemon in UU. It also has a nice immunity to Ghost-type moves, meaning it can switch into Choice-locked Chandelure and nab a free Volt Switch.</p> <p>While Heliolisk has two immunities and a colorful movepool, it is weak to common attacking types in UU such as Ground and Fighting. This is also exacerbated by the fact that it has pitiful 62 / 52 physical bulk, meaning even resisted physical hits are going to take a chunk of Heliolisk's HP. It must also use Life Orb, which can wear it down even more quickly if it wants to take advantage of its coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glare is a great option, allowing Heliolisk to cripple Pokemon that may try to switch into it, such as Ground-types. However, Heliolisk has amazing coverage and would much rather take advantage of that to try and cripple the enemy. Choice Scarf allows Heliolisk to outspeed a lot of common Choice Scarf users, such as Mienshao and Infernape, as well as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl. Substitute can be a nice move for Heliolisk, allowing it to avoid status, and it can gain HP fairly easily thanks to Dry Skin. Leftovers can be used over Life Orb. Without Life Orb, however, Heliolisk loses a lot of power and cannot 2HKO Suicune. Signal Beam is another option, hitting Grass-types harder for super effective damage. However, like Chesnaught and Roserade, most Grass-types in UU are neutral to Bug thanks to their secondary typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Sylveon and Blissey can tank any move Heliolisk has to offer and proceed to Wish stall Heliolisk or use Toxic to poison it.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Users</strong>: Calm Mind users, such as Reuniclus, can Recover off any damage they have taken from Life Orb Heliolisk, which Reuniclus can take advantage of by setting up Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: With Heliolisk having such frail Defense, any hard hitting physical attacker such as Entei or Mienshao can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Most forms of priority, bar Aqua Jet, are going to hit Heliolisk hard due to its pitiful bulk. Furthermore, Heliolisk is weak to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, two common priority moves in UU.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is a STAB move that provides easy momentum for Heliolisk's team. Hyper Voice is a decent STAB move as well, hitting all Ground-types as well as striking targets through Substitute. Signal Beam is for bulky Dark-type and Grass-types, such as Hydreigon and Celebi, that may attempt to switch into Heliolisk's STAB moves. Thunderbolt is a reliable STAB move and secures the 2HKO on Suicune. Surf can be used instead of Signal Beam, as it hits Nidoqueen and Nidoking along with Rotom-H for super effective damage at the cost of reliably OHKOing Celebi. Focus Blast may also be used to hit certain Dark- and Steel-types, such as Hydreigon and Mega Aggron, a lot harder. Focus Blast also nails many special walls, such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Blissey, harder than any other move Heliolisk has.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Heliolisk to outspeed many threats and to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Heliolisk's attacks while giving it the freedom to switch between its moves, but Choice Specs can be used instead for more initial power at the cost of not being able to switch between moves. A Timid nature allows Heliolisk to outspeed base 108 Pokemon, such as Infernape, Galvantula, Virizion, and Cobalion. Dry Skin is used to allow Heliolisk to switch in on Water-types and threaten them with a Life Orb-boosted STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set enjoys being brought in after a teammate has fainted or with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn rather than hard switching in, as Heliolisk cannot take many hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fire-types particularly enjoy Heliolisk's ability to absorb Water-type moves and threaten Water-types back with its STAB Electric-type attacks. Entei is a particularly good partner, as it serves as a very good wallbreaker once bulky Water-types are worn down or gone. Flying-types make good partners as well, as they can take care of all of Heliolisk's weaknesses; they resist Fighting-type attacks and take no damage from Ground-type attacks. Crobat is a particularly good partner, as it can form a VoltTurn core with Heliolisk, providing easy momentum for the team. Other U-turn users such as Mega Beedrill and Mienshao can also be good partners and form an effective VoltTurn core with Heliolisk. Rain support from the likes of Whimsicott or Tornadus can prove very helpful, as Dry Skin's recovery under the rain essentially negates the recoil of Life Orb. Thunder can be an option for Heliolisk to use over Thunderbolt, as it gains 100% accuracy under the rain and hits a lot harder.</p>"

  "Tyrantrum": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyrantrum makes for a powerful wallbreaker in the UU tier thanks to its access to two mind-blowingly powerful STAB moves in a recoil-free Head Smash and Outrage, especially coming off its high base 121 Attack. Tyrantrum also possesses a good physical movepool that gives it wide coverage. Furthermore, Tyrantrum also possesses good physical bulk along with resistances to Fire, Flying, and Poison, allowing it to take on a few relevant threats well, such as Darmanitan, Crobat, and to an extent Entei. However, Tyrantrum has relatively mediocre Speed, which makes it fairly easy to revenge kill. This is compounded by its weaknesses to Fighting-, Ground-, Fairy-, and Dragon-types, leaving it prone to common Pokemon such as Mienshao, Krookodile, and Whimsicott. Tyrantrum also possesses poor special bulk, making it easy to take down with a special attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tyrantrum has access to the move Dragon Dance, which it can utilize to boost both Attack and Speed at once. However, even after one boost, Tyrantrum still finds itself easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao, Krookodile, and Hydreigon. It can also learn Hone Claws, which can make its Head Smash stronger and also accurate, but this strategy is generally not reliable. Tyrantrum can also make use of Stealth Rock to support its team, but there are generally more effective users of Stealth Rock available, such as Krookodile, Mamoswine, and Nidoqueen. Tyrantrum can also use Mental Herb on the Rock Polish set in order to bypass Taunt and Encore from Whimsicott, but this is incredibly situational.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Aggron in particular can take on anything Tyrantrum has to offer, having the sheer bulk to tank even an Earthquake. It can then retaliate with Heavy Slam or Earthquake. Bronzong can also take on Tyrantrum to a decent degree and hit it with Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: In particular, Fighting-, Ground-, and Dragon-types are capable of revenge killing Tyrantrum with relative ease. Good examples of these Pokemon include Mienshao, Krookodile, Mamoswine, and Hydreigon, all of which can revenge kill Tyrantrum.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types, though not able to safely switch into Tyrantrum, can still avoid an OHKO in a one-on-one situation and either force it out or threaten it with Scald or Ice Beam. Good examples include Suicune, Mega Blastoise, and Swampert.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash serves as Tyrantrum's primary STAB move, which packs an incredible amount of power. Thanks to Rock Head, Tyrantrum can use this move without any recoil. Outrage hits quite hard as well, and it hits several Pokemon that resist Head Smash such as Swampert, Chesnaught, and Machamp. Earthquake allows Tyrantrum to hit opposing Nidoqueen, Cobalion, and to an extent Doublade hard. Superpower serves as a powerful move to hit Krookodile hard, OHKOing offensive variants while heavily denting defensive variants.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Band allows Tyrantrum to hit with extreme immediate power, while Rock Head allows Tyrantrum to use Head Smash without worrying about recoil. An Adamant nature along with maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Tyrantrum to hit very hard, but a Jolly nature allows Tyrantrum to outspeed Modest Chandelure and Nidoqueen, which can be important.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyrantrum, with this set, becomes an extremely powerful wallbreaker. Therefore, it is advised that one try to get Tyrantrum into the battle safely so it can proceed to do significant damage to the opposing team. It is important to be aware that Tyrantrum possesses a relatively mediocre Speed tier, which makes it quite easy to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Pokemon that can deal with faster teams, such as Heliolisk or Choice Scarf Krookodile, is a great option to help Tyrantrum against more offensive builds. Such Pokemon can also benefit from Tyrantrum's ability to wallbreak effectively. Whimsicott can also help Tyrantrum deal with offensive teams better, either via Stun Spore or Tailwind. It can also deal with opposing Pokemon that beat Tyrantrum such as bulky Water-types, Dragon-types, Fighting-types, and Krookodile. Hydreigon can form a strong wallbreaking core with Tyrantrum by breaking down many of Tyrantrum's counters such as Mega Aggron. Nidoqueen can take on Heracross and Mienshao while setting up Stealth Rock. Late-game cleaners such as Slurpuff and Mega Sharpedo also benefit from Tyrantrum's wallbreaking prowess, as it allows them to clean more efficiently late-game. Finally, entry hazard support is also appreciated to help Tyrantrum wallbreak more efficiently. Forretress, Froslass, and Chesnaught can all provide effective entry hazard support.</p>"
      },
      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish boosts Tyrantrum's Speed to an extremely high level, allowing it to outspeed many Pokemon in the metagame. Head Smash provides a powerful STAB move that severely dents almost everything. Dragon Claw allows Tyrantrum to hit Pokemon that resist Head Smash somewhat hard. Outrage, however, provides immense power and neutral coverage, but it locks Tyrantrum into the move. Earthquake allows Tyrantrum to hit Steel-types such as Cobalion and Doublade quite hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is needed for Tyrantrum to best sweep. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant because it allows Tyrantrum to outspeed Choice Scarf Mienshao and Infernape after a boost. Rock Head allows Tyrantrum to freely use Head Smash without any recoil. Life Orb is generally the preferred choice for the extra power, while Lum Berry can allow Tyrantrum to have a one-time cure of status while setting up. Alternatively, Stone Plate can be used on Tyrantrum to give a slight boost to Head Smash's power without the drawback of Life Orb's recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This particular set of Tyrantrum performs more as a sweeper than a wallbreaker, and works best late in the game. However, Tyrantrum still packs strong power with this set, so make use of it whenever possible. Tyrantrum finds its best setup opportunities against Pokemon that cannot touch it, such as Crobat and Entei, as well as defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, so make use of such setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set of Tyrantrum works excellently with other wallbreaking Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, which can help remove threats such as Swampert and Nidoqueen. Heracross also wallbreaks decently, and it can handle Mamoswine, Krookodile, and Bronzong nicely. A Volt Switch user such as Forretress or Heliolisk can also help get Tyrantrum in safely in order to set up. Forretress can also provide Rapid Spin and entry hazard support, both of which can prove very useful. Chesnaught, Froslass, and Mega Aggron can all provide entry hazard support to allow Tyrantrum to sweep more effectively.</p>"

  "Sylveon": {
    "overview": "<p>Sylveon is one of the best wallbreakers in the UnderUsed tier thanks to Pixilate Hyper Voice being able to blast past frail resistant Pokemon. Its mono-Fairy typing allows it to switch into strong and powerful Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-type moves such as Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Heracross's Close Combat. Sylveon's 95 / 130 special bulk allows it to check some moderately powerful special attackers even if uninvested. Sylveon also gives Florges competition as a cleric, since it has more physical bulk and a more powerful STAB attack. It does, however, lack one-turn recovery unlike Florges. Unfortunately, Sylveon's physical bulk is decidedly mediocre when uninvested, meaning that most strong neutral attacks, and even some resisted ones, can 2HKO it. Also, most Dragon-types generally carry coverage for Fairy-types, meaning Sylveon has to play carefully around them. Furthermore, Sylveon is also held back by a less than stellar base 60 Speed, meaning it can't do much against faster teams that apply a ton of offensive pressure.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set with Pixie Plate can bluff Choice Specs and surprise some of Sylveon's checks and counters. Quick Attack can help pick off weakened threats, but it lacks power due to Sylveon's less than stellar base 65 Attack. Lastly, Hyper Beam can give Sylveon a very powerful nuke, but the recharge turn can give the opposing Pokemon setup opportunities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mega Aggron, Escavalier, and specially defensive Empoleon are at worst 3HKOed by Hyper Voice and have super effective STAB moves to fire back at Sylveon. Mega Aggron and Escavalier still have to be wary of Hidden Power Fire, though, as the former has no reliable recovery and the latter is OHKOed after one switch into Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Entei, Darmanitan, and Arcanine can switch into Sylveon's STAB move, but they also suffer from a nasty Stealth Rock weakness, which means they can be very easily worn down.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Nidoqueen and Tentacruel can force Sylveon out with their STAB moves and ability to outspeed it. Both lack reliable recovery, however, meaning Sylveon can wear them down. Mega Beedrill can also check Sylveon offensively, as it can punish Sylveon switching out by using U-turn and gaining momentum off of it. Crobat, while normally not carrying a Poison-type STAB move, can still threaten it out with a powerful Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Attackers</strong>: Mamoswine, Krookodile, and Crawdaunt can all break past Sylveon with their STAB moves despite none of them being able to switch into Sylveon's STAB move themselves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Blissey and Cresselia can switch into Sylveon's Hyper Voice with ease and heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled and Moonlight, respectively. Cresselia can even set up Calm Minds against it, punishing Sylveon for staying in and trying to constantly use Hyper Voice.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hyper Voice is Sylveon's go-to move, as, thanks to Pixilate, it becomes a very powerful STAB move that also bypasses Substitutes. Psyshock provides coverage against Poison-types such as Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Crobat, although Hyper Voice can blow past these checks with just a little bit of prior damage. Hidden Power Fire is Sylveon's best option for Steel-types such as Escavalier and specially defensive Forretress. Shadow Ball is used to nail Pokemon such as Metagross and Bronzong harder than its other moves. Hidden Power Ground can be another option over Hidden Power Fire to gain excellent neutral coverage in conjunction with its STAB Hyper Voice.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Sylveon to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Pixilate allows Sylveon to have a more powerful Fairy-type STAB attack in Hyper Voice. A Modest nature bolsters Sylveon's great base 110 Special Attack, while a Timid nature can surprise opponents by letting Sylveon outspeed more threats while not missing out on any key OHKOs or 2HKOs. Choice Specs further boosts Sylveon's power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sylveon is best used on bulky offense teams that appreciate a very powerful wallbreaker with a great all-around typing. Sylveon is fairly physically frail, though, so it must be wary of switching into or staying in on powerful neutral hits, as it has no form of recovery. Sylveon should be wary of certain Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, as they could be carrying coverage for it. Sylveon should look for any opportunity to come in safely and proceed to spam Hyper Voice to wear down its checks and counters.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Krookodile is the best partner for Sylveon, as it can threaten most of Sylveon's checks such as Bronzong, Metagross, Arcanine, and Cresselia by trapping them with Pursuit, crippling them with Knock Off, or hitting them hard with Earthquake. Sylveon helps out Krookodile as well by combating its main checks such as Mandibuzz and Chesnaught. Steel-types such as Cobalion and Doublade have good defensive synergy with Sylveon and can threaten to sweep once Sylveon breaks down walls. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Froslass, Tentacruel, and Celebi can chip away at Sylveon's switch-ins, further wearing them down and allowing Sylveon to steamroll the opposing team. Specifically, Forretress can provide Spikes, switch into some of Sylveon's checks, and pivot into it with Volt Switch. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Cobalion appreciate Sylveon's ability to wear down their common checks so that they can power through, while Cobalion also shares type synergy with Sylveon's mono-Fairy typing. Pokemon that can beat opposing Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types such as Entei, Infernape, and Mamoswine allow Sylveon to freely spam its STAB move.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Even without investment, Hyper Voice is still a moderately powerful STAB move thanks to Pixilate and can still 2HKO certain offensive Pokemon, but it fails to take care of more bulky threats such as Suicune. Heal Bell gives cleric support to the team. Wish allows Sylveon to heal itself and its teammates. Protect allows Sylveon to scout the opponent while guaranteeing it can heal itself.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs give Sylveon as much physical bulk as possible. A Bold nature further reinforces Sylveon's below-average Defense stat. Leftovers gives Sylveon a way to passively recover HP. Pixilate is used because Sylveon can still hit hard with Hyper Voice even with no investment. An EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 SpD with a Calm nature allows Sylveon to take advantage of its amazing base 130 Special Defense while still investing in its Defense. A Bold nature can allow Sylveon to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Heracross while having a harder time against strong special attackers such as Kyurem and Mega Sceptile. A Calm nature, however, can let Sylveon take on specially attacking threats better but at the cost of losing to those physical attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works better on more balanced teams, as it can offer up big Wishes as well as being able to take on some massive threats such as Hydreigon. This set, despite the defensive investment, still needs to be wary of powerful neutral physical hits, as Sylveon can take quite a bit from Choice Band Entei, Choice Band Crobat, Mamoswine, and Mega Swampert.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types that appreciate Wish support such as Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix resist Sylveon's Steel weakness and are immune to Sylveon's Poison weakness, while Sylveon can take on Fighting-types for them. Dragon-types such as Hydreigon give the team more offensive presence, and while both have access to reliable recovery, they appreciate Sylveon's cleric support because they no longer have to worry about being crippled by status. They also are able to switch into Fire-types such as Entei that can switch into Sylveon with ease. Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert take advantage of Sylveon's fat Wishes while also taking on powerful Fire-types such as Entei. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Crobat, Tentacruel, and Empoleon makes sure that Sylveon doesn't get worn down itself while keeping the team at an advantage against the opponent.</p>"

Goodra has great coverage options; fortunately, Goodra also has the stat distribution to run both physically and specially oriented sets.

Power Whip provides good coverage against bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Alomomola, Swampert, and Suicune, hitting them for super effective damage. Iron Tail hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Florges and Sylveon which are immune to Goodra's STAB moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band gives Goodra a massive Attack stat, letting it hit incredibly hard with all of its attacks. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature allows Goodra to dish out a lot of damage from its physical attacks. 44 Speed EVs allow Goodra to outspeed uninvested base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Gligar, Suicune, and Cresselia. Sap Sipper gives Goodra an immunity to Grass-type attacks as well as a free Attack boost upon switching into one. An alternate EV spread of 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe can be used to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and OHKO it with Outrage. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, allowing Goodra to tank hits more efficiently.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Goodra can freely switch into Grass-type attacks to get a free Attack boost, which, in tandem with Choice Band, makes Goodra an incredibly fearsome wallbreaker with the power to break down even the sturdiest of physical walls. Goodra also works as a great switch-in to special Water- and Electric-type attacks thanks to its phenomenal special bulk and good defensive typing.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Blastoise is a great teammate that can lure in common Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon and attacks, while also providing entry hazard support with Rapid Spin. Mega Aggron can provide a switch-in to physical attacks that Goodra might have problems tanking, while also providing Stealth Rock support. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Sylveon and Florges are free switch ins to the Dragon-type attacks targeted at Goodra. Alomomola is a good teammate to Goodra, as it can lure Grass-type attacks to activate Goodra's Sap Sipper and provides Wish support if Goodra gets low on HP. Fast revenge killers such as Mienshao and Krookodile can beat faster threats that Goodra would be too slow to deal with.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Goodra's main STAB and hits with monstrous power in combination with Goodra's decent Special Attack and Choice Specs. Fire Blast hits Steel-types such as Forretress, which resist Goodra's STAB moves. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Florges and Sylveon, which are immune to Goodra's STAB moves, for super effective damage. Thunderbolt hits bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Empoleon, and Suicune, while Muddy Water can be used to hit Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Krookodile and Chandelure for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs gives Goodra a massive Special Attack stat, letting it hit as hard as possible in combination with a Modest nature and maximum Special Attack EVs. 44 Speed EVs allow Goodra to outspeed uninvested base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Gligar, Suicune, and Cresselia. Sap Sipper is the ability of choice, giving Goodra an immunity to all Grass-type attacks. An alternate EV spread of 72 HP / 252 SpA / 184 Spe can be utilized to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and OHKO it with Draco Meteor. The remaining EVs are placed into Goodra's HP stat to help back up its natural bulk, thus allowing it to take incoming attacks better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Goodra's phenomenal special bulk makes it a fantastic pivot into special attacks, and Goodra's strong offensive presence allows it to hit whatever switches in decently hard. Goodra likes to switch into Pokemon it can handle extremely easily, such as Shaymin and Chandelure. Be wary of staying in against strong physical attacks, as Goodra's mediocre Defense leaves it extremely vulnerable to strong physical attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola is a fantastic teammate that can not only pass Wishes to Goodra but can also switch in on physical attacks that Goodra would have trouble tanking. Similarly, Goodra can switch in on threatening special hits, such as Shaymin's Seed Flare, that Alomomola does not like to stay in against. Swampert can provide Stealth Rock support to help wear down foes for Goodra, while also providing good type synergy. Florges and Aromatisse are good partners as well, as they can provide cleric support and Goodra cannot recover HP on its own. Mega Aggron not only has fantastic physical bulk but can also provide Stealth Rock support.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Goodra's most powerful STAB attack, and it hits like a truck even without a boosting item. However, this attack lowers Goodra's Special Attack by two stages, and has a 10% change of missing. Dragon Pulse is an option, providing less power than Draco Meteor but not having the nasty side effects that come along with it. Fire Blast hits Steel types, such as Mega Aggron, Forretress, and Mega Steelix, which resist Goodra's main STAB move, for super effective damage. Flamethrower can be used over this for perfect accuracy but less power. Thunderbolt hits bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Alomomola and Empoleon for super effective damage and provides unresisted coverage with Fire and Dragon. Dragon Tail is useful for phazing opposing Pokemon that might attempt to set up. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Florges and Sylveon which are immune to Goodra's main STAB move, while Muddy Water hits bulky Ground- and Water-type Pokemon. Ice Beam can be used to hit Gligar, while Power Whip is mainly used to hit Swampert.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Assault Vest boosts Goodra's already high natural Special Defense to extraordinary levels, taking even certain super effective hits incredibly well. Sap Sipper is the ability of choice, giving Goodra a free switch into Grass-type attacks and boosting Dragon Tail's power. Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature lets Goodra hit as hard as possible. 248 HP EVs boost Goodra's good natural bulk, while reducing residual damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Goodra has free reign to switch into the majority of special attacks, taking most of them fantastically well, which makes it a fantastic pivot into special attackers such as Chandelure and Shaymin; take this advantage to hit whatever switches in extremely hard with one of Goodra's attacks. Be extremely wary about attempting to stay in against physical attacks, as even with investment into bulk, Goodra's mediocre Defense leaves much to be desired.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alomomola can switch freely in to most physical attacks aimed at Goodra while also giving Wish support. Goodra can also switch into a plethora special attacks that might threaten Alomomola. Swampert not only provides fantastic type synergy with Goodra, but it can also lay down Stealth Rock to help it wear down its foes. Florges and Aromatisse can provide Wish support as well, as Goodra can get worn down easily throughout the battle. Mega Aggron has phenomenal physical Defense, being able to comfortably switch into many physical hits that threaten Goodra. It can also provide Stealth Rock support so Goodra has an easier time wearing down its foes.</p>"

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<p>Klefki's vast support movepool with access to moves such as Spikes, Thunder Wave, dual screens, and Fairy Lock in tandem with its Prankster ability allows it to reliably set up entry hazards and shut down fast Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sharpedo. It also has a great defensive typing in Steel / Fairy with only two weaknesses, matching up well against common Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Sylveon, and Crobat. Given its unique utility, Klefki is best used on offense or balance teams to lay entry hazards and provide a catch-all check to faster threats. Klefki also finds itself incredibly flexible with moveslots, as they can be tailored to fit the team's needs. However, Klefki possesses incredibly mediocre stats across the board, largely forcing it to rely on its typing to stomach hits and leaving it more passive than it would prefer if it's not running the ideal moveset to deal with a given Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Klefki makes for a solid weather setter when holding the corresponding item to increase the condition's duration thanks to its Prankster ability. Foul Play is an option as an attack on the support set, but a STAB move or Toxic is generally preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rapid Spin users</strong>: Common Rapid Spin users such as Forretress and Tentacruel do not fear Klefki and can proceed to remove entry hazards and set their own.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Offensive Fire-types such as Entei, Chandelure, and Infernape all threaten Klefki out but must be wary of Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Metagross, Doublade, and Mega Aggron have little fear of Klefki and can perform their respective roles in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Espeon</strong>: Espeon, specifically Calm Mind variants, can reflect Klefki's Spikes with Magic Bounce and set up in front of it.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes damage grounded opposing Pokemon in order to help pave the way for cleaners in the back. Thunder Wave provides a nice form of speed control and is especially useful against offensive Pokemon to essentially neuter them as threats. Dazzling Gleam is one of Klefki's main STAB moves and allows it to hit huge threats such as Hydreigon, Conkeldurr, Mega Sceptile, and Krookodile for super effective damage. Flash Cannon is the other STAB option and works best when paired with Heal Block, notably allowing it to beat Wish Sylveon one-on-one. Toxic is another useful option, letting Klefki act as a solid answer to bulky Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Cresselia, and Slowking. Magnet Rise allows Klefki to avoid heavy damage from powerful Ground-types such as Krookodile, Nidoqueen, and Mamoswine and proceed to set up Spikes. Heal Block pairs nicely with Toxic and prevents Pokemon such as Sylveon, Snorlax, and Conkeldurr from using their respective recovery moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Calm nature maximizes Klefki's special bulk and gives it the best possible matchup against special attackers such as Mega Sceptile and Hydreigon. Leftovers provides Klefki with a solid form of passive recovery from turn to turn. Prankster gives all of Klefki's non-damaging moves priority, letting it get up layers of Spikes more reliably and paralyze faster Pokemon with Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Klefki should set up Spikes early-game in order to whittle down grounded foes throughout the course of a match. Thunder Wave should be used to cripple fast threats and provide speed control for slower threats in the back. Toxic should be used to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia and Mandibuzz, severely limiting their longevity. Klefki should use Magnet Rise against Ground-types to essentially wall them and set up more layers of Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Klefki fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that need a catch-all check to fast threats and appreciate its ability to stack entry hazards. Klefki prefers Rapid Spin support as opposed to Defog in order to keep as many entry hazards on the opponent's side as possible; Tentacruel is a solid example. Klefki also pairs nicely with offensive Pokemon that appreciate Spikes support such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Sharpedo, Mega Beedrill, Mega Sceptile, and Entei. Defensive Swampert and the aforementioned Tentacruel check some of the offensive Fire- and Steel-types that threaten Klefki and can set up their respective hazards alongside Klefki's Spikes. Roar Suicune also checks many of the Fire- and Steel-types that threaten Klefki and can phaze them to rack up residual damage on the opposing team. Especially if it's not running Magnet Rise, Klefki needs partners that can switch into powerful Ground-types like Krookodile and Nidoking, such as Mandibuzz and Hydreigon. Relatively slow wallbreakers such as Nidoqueen and Choice Specs Chandelure appreciate the speed control provided by Klefki's Thunder Wave. Pokemon that can block Rapid Spin and threaten the common users in Forretress and Tentacruel such as Chandelure, Hoopa, and Jellicent also pair brilliantly with Klefki.</p>"

      "Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Light Screen and Reflect temporarily reduce all damage done to the user's team, giving sweepers in the back more opportunities to set up or attack. Spikes racks up damage on grounded foes, wearing them down for a potential sweep late-game. Fairy Lock prevents the target from switching for one turn, allowing an appropriate sweeper to set up in a favorable matchup behind screens after Klefki is KOed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP and Special Defense investment with a Calm nature allows Klefki to take hits as well as possible and aids it in setting up screens and entry hazards. Light Clay increases the duration of Light Screen and Reflect from five turns to eight, giving sweepers a larger window to set up or attack. Prankster gives priority to all of Klefki's non-damaging moves, letting it set up screens and entry hazards on faster Pokemon much more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Klefki set should be used exclusively on hyper offense teams that appreciate screens and Spikes support. Klefki should set up screens early in the game in order for its teammates to take as little damage as possible as they either set up or exert offensive pressure. After setting up screens, Klefki should set up as many entry hazards as possible to whittle down opposing walls for offensive partners. Fairy Lock should only be used when the user expects Klefki to be KOed so that a teammate can take advantage of the trapped foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sweepers that appreciate screens support such as Belly Drum Slurpuff, Dragon Dance Haxorus, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Dragon Dance Gyarados make for good partners, as they have a much easier time setting up. Klefki also pairs well with Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Taunt Krookodile that threaten and pressure common Defog users such as Crobat and Mandibuzz.</p>"

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Diancie's typing is unique and backed up by incredible defenses, allowing it to take hits from prominent threats in the tier such as Mega Absol, Hydreigon, and Entei. It also has decent offensive stats and coverage that allow it to not be complete setup bait to most Pokemon, as well as a lot of tools to use to work as an effective Trick Room setter. Diancie's STAB Diamond Storm and access to Stealth Rock give it offensive pressure against common Defoggers. On the downside, some Pokemon still take advantage of it, like Suicune and Feraligatr. Diancie also has low Speed and no priority, allowing it to get picked off quite easily by the likes of Roserade, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Blastoise. Its typing, while unique and useful, leaves it with many weaknesses to Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Roserade, as well as a glaring 4x weakness to Steel-type attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Calm Mind and Rest + Sleep Talk can be used, but such a set competes with Florges, which has a less exploitable weakness. However, Diancie does have the perk of being able to take on Entei and Crobat better. A dual screens set can work but is more effectively pulled off by other Pokemon such as Cresselia. Rock Polish can be used to attempt a sweep; however, Diancie still has a rather bad Speed tier and only decent attack power, meaning it's not enough to be getting the KOs it would need. A more physically inclined set running Custap Berry with Explosion rather than Earth Power or Protect works on offensive teams. Magnet Rise can be used to avoid Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake and Earth Power; however, Diancie is too slow to pull this trick off effectively. Sharpen can be used to boost the power of Diamond Storm, but with the plentiful Steel-types in the tier, this becomes useless most of the time. Weakness Policy can be used to take advantage of Diancie's high defenses; however, it requires Diancie to take a super effective hit and is only worth using on Trick Room sets due to its low Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types often give Diancie the most trouble because of the obvious 4x weakness. They resist all of Diancie's STAB attacks and take little damage from Explosion. The only thing they have to be wary of is Earth Power, which will most likely not OHKO them, and Pokemon threatening Diancie will most likely be faster. Pokemon such as Forretress and Mega Aggron have a much easier time switching into Diancie than Pokemon such as Cobalion and Doublade, which get crippled quite easily.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types can scare Diancie in a multitude of ways. Offensive Pokemon such as Mega Sharpedo and Feraligatr threaten an OHKO, while some Pokemon like Mega Swampert and Suicune can use it to set up Rain Dance and Calm Mind, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As Diancie lacks any form of recovery, status effects and entry hazards can wear it down with ease. Toxic Spikes is a real thorn in its side, as it puts a timer on how long Diancie can stay in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Diancie and slower teammates to get the edge against faster Pokemon. Stealth Rock gives Diancie another purpose other than Trick Room and gives the team a Stealth Rock setter, allowing it to break Focus Sash and Sturdy and get chip damage in. Explosion allows Diancie to KO itself while doing massive damage to the foe, letting teammates utilize the maximum number of Trick Room turns. Moonblast is a very spammable STAB move that allows Diancie to hit Dark-types such as Mega Absol and Hydreigon. Diamond Storm is Diancie's highest-damaging move and hits Flying-types such as Mandibuzz as well as specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges and Hoopa.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb boosts the power of all of Diancie's attacks. Clear Body is Diancie's only ability, but it allows it to not get harmed by random defense drops or Intimidate. A Brave nature boosts the power of Diamond Storm and Explosion and lowers Diancie's Speed, meaning it outspeeds neutral-natured Slowking in Trick Room. Maximum Attack and Special Attack investment allows Diancie to hit as hard as possible. Running 0 Speed IVs makes Diancie as slow as possible, allowing it to outspeed most offensive threats in Trick Room. Mental Herb protects Diancie from Taunt once so it can always set up Trick Room. 252 EVs can be taken from either Special Attack or Attack and added in HP to allow Diancie to take hits better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Diancie is usually played as a lead for Trick Room teams unless the opponent has a suicide lead, Empoleon, or Tentacruel. Diancie should optimize the order of its moves by using Stealth Rock first and then Trick Room; this way you don't waste a turn of Trick Room. If Diancie cannot take two hits from the opposing Pokemon, it can either switch out or set up Trick Room and use Explosion. Diamond Storm should only be used if it hits the opposing Pokemon super effectively, unless that Pokemon is faster and can OHKO Diancie. Opposing Taunt leads are an exception to not using Diamond Storm; for example, if Diancie is facing Froslass, using Diamond Storm prevents it from wasting a turn if Froslass uses Taunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The main reason to use this set is to support slower, hard-hitting Pokemon such as Pangoro, Crawdaunt, Dragalge, and Machamp. Mega Camerupt and other slow Fire-types help to remove Steel-types that trouble Diancie, while Crawdaunt can deal with Ground-types like Nidoking and Mamoswine. Diancie can apply offensive pressure once it activates Trick Room, but it does like to have Pokemon that back it up. Ground- and Fire-types deal with Diancie's Steel weakness quite well, and the latter can also deal with Grass-types that threaten Diancie. Diancie also likes fellow Trick Room setters such as Porygon2, Cresselia, and Aromatisse to help keep Trick Room up. Bronzong can complement Diancie a lot, resisting Grass- and Steel-type attacks while also being immune to Ground-type attacks thanks to Levitate. Diancie can cover Bronzong's Dark and Fire weaknesses extremely well in return.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows for chip damage on opposing Pokemon. Heal Bell provides status removal support for Diancie and its team. Heal Bell also allows Diancie to deal with Entei's Sacred Fire better by removing potential burns. Diamond Storm is useful for pressuring Flying-type Defoggers such as Crobat and Mandibuzz. Moonblast lets Diancie hit Dark-types such as Mega Absol and Hydreigon, as well as Dragon-types and Fighting-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is Diancie's only form of recovery and is needed in order to take hits. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Diancie to take on a lot of physical threats such as Entei and Toxicroak. The EVs can be shifted around to benefit your team better. For example, you can add more Special Defense investment if you already have a bulky Water-type to take on Fire-types. A Relaxed nature boosts Diancie's Defense and doesn't take away from any of its other important stats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keeping Diancie healthy so it can check what's needed is really important. This requires keeping entry hazards off the field and making sure that if it does receive damage, it is getting healed back up with Wish from teammates. In most situations, Diancie can switch into Defoggers such as Crobat and Mandibuzz and continue to apply pressure with Diamond Storm or reset Stealth Rock. If Diancie is not needed for any real important reason later in the match, it can be sent out to try to dish some damage against foes before it goes down. Be careful to not let your opponent take advantage of Diancie, though, as there are some Pokemon that can use that opportunity to set up, like Doublade and Reuniclus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diancie heavily appreciates Wish support due to its lack of reliable recovery. Pokemon that can provide this are Alomomola and Blissey. Diancie's fits well on defensive teams because it can compress many roles. To put it simply, if you need a defensive Fairy-type, a Stealth Rock setter, a Heal Bell cleric, and a Fire-resistant Pokemon all in one, Diancie can fit your team very well. Outside of that, it faces competition from Florges and Whimsicott as a supportive Fairy-type. Diancie also requires Pokemon that take on Steel- and Ground-types, such as Swampert and Chesnaught. It struggles to do anything against the likes of Tentacruel and Empoleon, so having a teammate that can take on both of these Pokemon is excellent. Toxicroak isn't scared of anything they can throw out, Electric-types like Mega Ampharos and Heliolisk can usually scare them off or get a KO, and strong Ground-types (preferably Ground-types that aren't weak to Scald) can also force both of these Pokemon out.</p>"

      "Bulky Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock makes Diancie a nice offensive entry hazard setter and can also help it get certain KOs. Moonblast is Diancie's best special STAB move that hits Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types, outright OHKOing Hydreigon. Diamond Storm helps to hit Flying-, Fire-, and Ice-types such as Tornadus, Rotom-H, and Froslass. Earth Power is a nice alternative to hit Steel-types that try to switch in, such as Doublade and Aggron, and Fire-types if Diancie gets burned.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is Diancie's only form of recovery outside of Rest and helps with its longevity. Clear Body is Diancie's only ability, but it allows it to not lose any offensive power from Intimidate or random stat drops. 252 HP EVs allow Diancie to take attacks better, which is very important, as Diancie doesn't have reliable recovery. 252 Special Attack EVs in tandem with a Quiet nature maximizes its overall damage output. A Quiet nature is used because Diancie doesn't want to cut away from its bulk or make Diamond Storm weaker, and it already has mediocre Speed anyways.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>For the most part, Diancie doesn't have a lot of offensive presence against anything that it doesn't hit super effectively. Don't give up free turns to Pokemon Diancie cannot do too much damage to such as Snorlax and Suicune, as it becomes setup fodder. Earth Power should be used to catch incoming Steel-type switch-ins. Diancie can struggle to find switch in opportunities on occasion, but its best opportunities are on Choice-locked Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Darmanitan.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that have good matchups against Steel-types like Swampert, Cobalion, and Krookodile aid against Diancie's biggest bane. Diancie is very susceptible to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, so having good entry hazard control is key to its longevity. Diancie can handle Fire-types pretty solidly, so teammates such as Mega Abomasnow and Shaymin can come in more safely, and in return, they can remove Water-types that threaten Diancie. Fire-types such as Arcanine and Entei help to remove Grass-types that can punish Diancie. Since Diancie has no recovery outside of Leftovers, which can be removed with Knock Off, Wish support from Pokemon like Alomomola and Blissey can help out. Diancie helps against opposing Dragon-types, so the likes of Mega Sceptile and Kyurem can take advantage of that. Diancie fits best onto bulky offensive teams due to its ability to check and counter a plethora of things. Cleric support helps Diancie, as it doesn't possess reliable recovery and tends to not carry Heal Bell, meaning it gets crippled by status. Pokemon such as Alomomola and Umbreon can perform this role.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Hoopa is a fearsome wallbreaker with an extremely high Special Attack stat as well as fantastic coverage moves in Psyshock, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast. With access to Nasty Plot and Trick Room, Hoopa can put severe dents in certain playstyles, with Nasty Plot beating more defensively-oriented teams and Trick Room punishing more offensive teams. Hoopa also also sports a nice Special Defense stat, allowing it to take hits from a wide variety of special attackers such as Suicune and Florges and thus easily set up Trick Room or Nasty Plot. Although Hoopa does have some nice strengths, its Defense and Speed stats are hardly desirable, as it's outsped and KOed by the majority of physical attackers in the tier, forcing Hoopa to have Trick Room up much of the time. Its Psychic / Ghost typing can be a blessing as well as a condemnation, as it allows Hoopa to come in safely on common bulky setup sweepers such as Reuniclus, Florges, and Snorlax but also leaves it susceptible to potential Pursuit users such as Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Sash can allow Hoopa to get a surprise KO on Pursuit trappers and steal their item in the process. Choice Scarf or Choice Specs alongside Trick boosts Hoopa's Speed or Special Attack and allows it to cripple walls, but Hoopa really appreciates being able to switch its moves due to the fantastic coverage it has access to. Thunder Wave punishes offensive switch-ins such as Hydreigon and Chandelure and gives Hoopa a chance to KO them afterwards. Destiny Bond can be helpful against slower Sucker Punch users such as Honchkrow. Taunt can be used to prevent slower entry hazard removers such as Mandibuzz and defensive Gligar from using Defog to clear away the entry hazards that Hoopa greatly benefits from. Reflect and Light Screen are nice support options for Hoopa, but Hoopa is better off being used a wallbreaker due to its high offensive stats. Physical moves such as Drain Punch and Gunk Shot are decent options to take advantage of Hoopa's base 110 Attack, but Hoopa's Special Attack lets it generally put a dent in everything anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: With Hoopa's 4x weakness to Dark-type moves and its lackluster Defense stat, Pursuit trappers such as Krookodile, Mega Aerodactyl, Escavalier, and Honchkrow are easily Hoopa's number one weakness.</p> <p><strong>Faster Physical Attackers</strong>: A lot of faster physical attackers can KO Hoopa in one hit with their STAB attacks or coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Dark- and Ghost-types</strong>: Pokemon like Hydreigon and Chandelure are quite common and easily fit on a great number of teams. These Pokemon can usually outspeed and KO Hoopa as well as switch into a predicted attack.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Although Hoopa can run Nasty Plot and Psyshock, special walls like Gligar and Mandibuzz can come in and eliminate Hoopa with Knock Off. If not running Nasty Plot or Psyshock, most special walls can take hits from Hoopa and heal up accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority Moves</strong>: Priority users such as Doublade, Mega Absol, and Honchkrow can easily take Hoopa out with any of their priority moves, even if Trick Room is up.</p>",

      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Hoopa to move first against many of its usual checks. Shadow Ball is Hoopa's most spammable STAB move with neutral coverage on most types and the added benefit of being super effective against bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Reuniclus. Psyshock allows Hoopa to break through more specially defensive Pokemon such as Snorlax and Florges. Psychic is a nice alternative that has more power but prevents Hoopa from hitting walls like Blissey and Florges on their weaker defensive stat. Focus Blast is Hoopa's coverage move to hit Dark- and Steel-types such as Krookodile and Cobalion. Energy Ball could be used as a way to ensure an OHKO on Krookodile without running the risk of missing with Focus Blast and to check bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb increases Hoopa's already exceptional wallbreaking prowess. A Modest nature and maximum investment in Special Attack further increases its wallbreaking abilities. The EVs make sure Hoopa is not entirely dependent on Trick Room, letting it outspeed common walls outside of Trick Room such as Umbreon and Florges. Alternatively, maximum HP and no Speed investment could be used to outpace these walls under Trick Room while also providing Hoopa with some bulk. Magician is Hoopa's only ability; it's not very useful for this specific set, unless Hoopa's running a Berry of some sort to help facilitate its sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hoopa is best used as a revenge killer and a wallbreaker against more defensively-minded teams. Trick Room is best used against more offensively-minded ones. When trying to set up Trick Room, always try to use it when Hoopa forces a switch or is facing a weaker special attacker such as Celebi or any of the Rotom formes. As for teams Hoopa can fit on, hyper offense and Hoopa complement each other by the offensive playstyle wearing teams down for an eventual Hoopa sweep. Trick Room teams can benefit from Hoopa's exceptional power and special bulk. Generally, Trick Room teams lack offensive Trick Room setters, but Hoopa can really excel at that role. Always be wary of Pursuit; notably, Trick Room being up can prevent Hoopa from being forced out by a potential Pursuit user.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Froslass, Forretress, and Metagross all work great with Hoopa, inducing chip damage on the opposing team to make Hoopa's job as a sweeper easier. Trick Room sweepers such as Pangoro and Escavalier can capitalize on Hoopa's Trick Room support. Strong special attackers such as Porygon-Z, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen can consistently put pressure on opposing special walls, paving the way for a Hoopa sweep. Memento users such as Whimsicott and Chandelure can allow Hoopa to set up Trick Room with ease on a weakened foe.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is Hoopa's main STAB move and provides neutral coverage across most types. Focus Blast helps immensely with taking out walls that Hoopa's STAB moves can't take on, such as Porygon2 and Umbreon. Psyshock gives Hoopa the ability to hit special walls such as Blissey and Florges on their weaker Defense stat. As Hoopa forces a ton of switches, Substitute gives it the ability to get a free hard hit off on anything. It also ensures safety against status spreaders such as Blissey and Porygon2. Nasty Plot can be used over a coverage move to allow Hoopa to efficiently remove common walls such as Empoleon, Florges, and Umbreon. Calm Mind could also be an option over Nasty Plot, as it allows Hoopa to take on more balanced teams a bit more easily, but Nasty Plot is generally better against most archetypes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Salac Berry allows Hoopa to outspeed common revenge killers once it is consumed such as Mamoswine and Mienshao. However, it can be swapped out for Life Orb or Leftovers depending on need for power or longevity. A Timid nature with maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack allows Hoopa to outspeed as many threats as possible while also doing maximum damage. 30 HP IVs allow Hoopa to consume the Salac Berry after setting up three Substitutes, allowing it to hit 393 Speed after the boost. If Hoopa is not running a Salac Berry, it should have a Modest nature instead, as it allows Hoopa to become a more potent wallbreaker. Magician can be effective at times, especially after consumption of the Salac Berry, as it can allow Hoopa to steal a beneficial item such as Leftovers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With a Salac Berry, it is important to conserve Hoopa's HP until an opportunity comes up to set up a Substitute, such as a forced switch. Hoopa can be used on a variety of playstyles, as almost every archetype can appreciate Hoopa's exceptional wallbreaking abilities. Hoopa can also set up on a number of Pokemon in the metagame, but you must be cautious of Pokemon that could be running coverage for Hoopa such as Shadow Ball Reuniclus and Crunch Snorlax. Try to never KO foes with Hoopa until all opposing Pursuit trappers are gone. Substitute can provide some safety from Pursuit trappers, though.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hoopa can really appreciate Sticky Web users such as Galvantula, as they help it outspeed common revenge killers such as Mamoswine and Krookodile. Hoopa also supports its team in return by blocking Rapid Spin. Dark- and Fighting-types such as Krookodile and Lucario have great offensive and defensive synergy with Hoopa as they can take out Hoopa's counters such as Gligar and Mandibuzz. A Memento user such as Whimsicott can lure some of the threats that Hoopa is able to set up on such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Dragalge. Knock Off users such as Krookodile and Conkeldurr can also be useful, as stealing the wrong item with Magician can put an end to a sweep.</p>"
