        "description": "<p>Nidoking uses its incredible coverage and Sheer Force to be a terrifying special wallbreaker. Earth Power is an excellent go-to move that forces out slower, Ground-weak Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran and 2HKOes common walls like Seismitoad and Ferrothorn. Gunk Shot can be used to outright 2HKO Blissey and deal massive damage to other special walls like Slowking, which improves the stall matchup, while Shell Side Arm is good for chunking Blissey and dealing consistent damage to Pokemon like Rotom-W. Gunk Shot's only drawback is the lower accuracy, making it slightly inconsistent in important situations. Ice Beam deals with Hippowdon and Tornadus-T, and Flamethrower deals with Steel- and Flying-types, rounding out Nidoking's perfect coverage on every Pokemon. Alternatively, Thunderbolt hits Slowking, Tornadus-T, and various Steel- and Flying types, but Ice Beam and Flamethrower are more effective. Nidoking typically uses a Rash nature to amplify its power as much as possible, but a Naive nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon like Adamant Excadrill, Jolly Buzzwole, and Timid Heatran. It should be noted that Nidoking's Poison typing can allow it to switch in on predicted Toxic from foes like Heatran and defensive Buzzwole. Nidoking can also switch in against Electric-types like Zeraora and Rotom-H. That being said, Nidoking doesn't like being chipped, so pivots like Corviknight, Cinderace, Rotom-W, and Tornadus-T allow it to get in more easily to wallbreak more often. Fast cleaners and wallbreakers are also appreciated as teammates to make up for Nidoking's lackluster speed, so Weavile, Cinderace, and Aerodactyl are all great partners.</p>"

Glare spreads paralysis, warding off wallbreakers like Gengar and Melmetal and providing speed control for slower wallbreakers such as Tyranitar and Buzzwole. Alternatively, Clefable's deep movepool allows it to run a vast array of other utility options; Teleport can bring the aforementioned wallbreakers in with ease, for example, matching up better against slower threats like Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn, which Glare is less effective against. Knock Off is also a good option, removing items such as Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots to drastically reduce the longevity of Pokemon like Heatran and Zeraora. Trick in conjunction with Sticky Barb can be used in a similar manner, albeit only one time. Clefable can use both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin on the same moveset for maximum role compression, although it loses any ability to deter aforementioned switch-ins like Gengar and Heatran in the process. The same holds true of both Aromatherapy and Wish, which are greatly appreciated by offensive tanks like Tornadus-T, Melmetal, and Heatran. VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Aerodactyl greatly appreciate Rapid Spin Clefable only removing opposing hazards, while Spikes setters like Seismitoad can form a hazard-stacking core with Stealth Rock Clefable. Skarmory and Ferrothorn are also very notable hazard setters, as they can handle physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Aerodactyl that punch through Clefable with ease. Similarly, Clefable struggles to take on strong special attackers like Keldeo and Rotom-H, so specially defensive teammates like Assault Vest Toxapex and Slowking are recommended.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Clefable takes advantage of passive switch-ins like Corviknight, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn lacking Grav Apple to accumulate multiple boosts, making itself a capable sweeper that can be difficult to take down. Rapid Spin offers entry hazard removal and bolsters Clefable's Speed stat, notably letting it outpace Choice Band Tyranitar after one boost and positive-natured base 95s like Obstagoon and Kyurem after two. Rapid Spin also invites in many hazard setters Clefable can boost against like Mudsdale and the aforementioned Gastrodon; since it pressured hazard setters, Calm Mind also makes it easier to keep hazards off the field. Glare is used to hinder threats like Fire Lash Cinderace and Nidoking that Clefable may force in after garnering boosts. An additional coverage move such as Flamethrower, Stored Power, or Thunder can be used instead to more immediately pressure Fairy-resistant walls such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and non-Assault Vest Toxapex, making Clefable a more independent sweeper but reducing its utility. 12 Speed EVs are used to outpace uninvested Tyranitar. Clefable pairs well with bulky Pokemon like Skarmory and Toxapex that benefit from its offensive presence, and in turn they can set hazards to wear down foes and switch into strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Tyranitar and Urshifu-R, that force Clefable out. Clefable is hard stopped by Toxapex carrying Haze or Clear Smog, and without Flamethrower it can't meaningfully damage offensive Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Melmetal and Excadrill, so teammates that can remove or weaken these threats such as offensive Rotom-H and Rocky Helmet Ferrothorn are greatly appreciated.</p>"

Water Shuriken always hits five times thanks to Skill Link, and it preempts Accelerock users like Aerodactyl and Terrakion after Shell Smash, preventing Cloyster from being revenge killed as easily. It also lets Cloyster reliably deal with weakened Choice Scarf users like Gengar, as well as naturally faster Pokemon like Zeraora. Freeze-Dry hits bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex, which would otherwise wall it completely. Icicle Spear provides stronger neutral coverage for bulky Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Clefable, and it being physical lets Cloyster better threaten Kyurem and Sylveon. Life Orb gives Cloyster the extra power it needs to break past bulky walls like Galarian Slowking and Buzzwole. 88 Speed EVs let Cloyster outspeed Aerodactyl, and 29 HP IVs minimize Life Orb recoil. Teammates like Buzzwole and Mimikyu can soften up teams for Cloyster to clean up. Cloyster's ability to remove Water-types like Toxapex and Rotom-W massively benefits teammates that tend to struggle against them, like Urshifu-R and Scizor. Due to entry hazards severely cutting into Cloyster's longevity and making it vulnerable to priority moves, entry hazard control is very important. Taunt leads like Mew and Heatran can prevent hazards from going up in the first place, and offensive entry hazard removers like Obstagoon, Tornadus-T, and Diggersby can remove them.</p>"

Power Whip can be run instead of Substitute to deal more damage to defensive Water-types like Rotom-W and Seismitoad. Leftovers provides passive recovery that allows Gyarados to use Substitute more times, but Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred on non-Substitute sets to prevent Stealth Rock damage.

It's also useful in beating other, slower priority users that may try to revenge kill Aerodactyl. Earthquake ensures an OHKO versus Heatran and good damage on Toxapex and Tyranitar.

Many offensive Pokemon, like Zeraora and Cinderace, appreciate the huge amounts of damage Aerodactyl can force onto walls like Ferrothorn and Mudsdale. Delayed moves like Future Sight and Doom Desire from Slowking and Heatran add an extra oomph to its attacks which net it OHKOs easier. Entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Seismitoad also helps it secure more KOs.

With Assault Vest, Slowking can check a plethora of special attackers like Alakazam, Heatran, and Cloyster. Flip Turn helps Slowking gain momentum against switch-ins like Hydreigon, Rotom-W, and Kyurem by bringing in the likes of Terrakion, Aerodactyl, and other attackers that struggle with switching in safely. Flip Turn also helps Slowking check setup sweepers it cannot beat on its own, like Clefable and Sylveon, by pivoting in powerful wallbreakers like Nidoking and Melmetal to force them out. Future Sight helps Slowking's teammates break through their checks. Steam Eruption does heavy damage to neutral targets like Clefable and Tornadus-T and can threaten burns against physical attackers attempting to switch in like Rillaboom and Dracozolt. Scald can also be used, as while it's noticeably weaker, its higher PP count is better suited for bulkier teams. Grass Knot lets Slowking hit Seismitoad, which otherwise threatens to wall and potentially trap Slowking. Flamethrower can be run to catch Ferrothorn off guard and check Cotton Guard variants. Lastly, Psystrike is a solid STAB move that lets Slowking do immediate damage to Toxapex and Urshifu-R, but gives up a coverage option. The EV spread lets Slowking avoid the 2HKO from offensive Tornadus-T and +1 Urshifu-R's Close Combat, while the rest is put in Special Defense to be a better special pivot. Offensive threats like Aerodactyl and Kyurem that struggle to get onto the field safely appreciate Slowking's pivoting support. As a special wall, Slowking is noticeably weaker on the physical side against physical attackers like Aerodactyl, Rillaboom, and Terrakion; physically defensive teammates like Ferrothorn and Buzzwole can help patch this weakness up. The latter can also switch into Dark-types like Tyranitar and Weavile, which otherwise pressure Slowking immensely. Slowking is usually unable to KO Calm Mind sweepers like Reuniclus and Clefable, so it needs a teammate to pivot to like Melmetal, Tyranitar, or Nidoking that can break through them. Electric-types like Zeraora and Thundurus-T pressure Slowking heavily, so checks to these like Mudsdale, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar are great teammates. Lastly, physical wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Cinderace really appreciate Slowking's Future Sight support to pressure switch-ins like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Mudsdale.</p>"

The entry hazard of choice is greatly dependent on Tyranitar's teammates; with teammates like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Seismitoad that prefer to set up Spikes, Stealth Rock is preferred.

Offensive Pokemon like Gengar, Weavile, and Keldeo appreciate Rotom-W's ability both to take physical hits and bring them in safely. Rotom-W struggles with special walls like Blissey and appreciates physically offensive teammates that can remove them, such as Aerodactyl and Terrakion, as well as teammates such as Corviknight that can switch into Grass-types like Rillaboom.</p>"

It can come in on a bevy of Pokemon like Clefable and Ferrothorn and force them out effectively. Magma Storm threatens the aforementioned Pokemon as well as Corviknight and Melmetal, letting Heatran set up Stealth Rock when they switch out. Earth Power lets Heatran hit Galarian Slowking, Tyranitar, opposing Heatran, and Toxapex for more reliable damage. Toxic debilitates switch-ins like Rotom-W, Seismitoad, and Latios, making it even harder to check Heatran over a long game. The combination of Magma Storm and Toxic also allows Heatran to spread huge amounts of residual damage. Doom Desire is an option over Toxic that enables dangerous wallbreakers like Keldeo and Buzzwole, forming dangerous offensive cores and making huge progress. Taunt blocks entry hazards and completely shuts down Pokemon like Blissey and Rotom-H, denying their recovery and making them easier to wear down. Heatran threatening a multitude of entry hazard removers, including Corviknight and Clefable, makes it an incredibly good user of Stealth Rock as well. King's Shield scouts Choice-locked attackers like Cinderace and Terrakion, lets Heatran recover more from Leftovers, and pairs nicely with both Toxic and Doom Desire to stall turns. The Attack drop also lets Heatran stay in on physical attackers like Tyranitar and force them out or take the subsequent attack with ease. However, Taunt and Stealth Rock provide more consistent utility against a variety of threats and are therefore preferred.</p> <p>Leftovers keeps Heatran healthy over the course of a game, letting it check Pokemon like Latios and Calm Mind Clefable long-term. 128 Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed Adamant Tyranitar. Flame Body is preferred to punish physical attackers like Weavile and Tornadus-T, but if the team requires a better switch-in to the likes of Rotom-H and coverage moves like Celesteela's Flamethrower, Flash Fire can be used. Heatran pairs well with a wide variety of Pokemon, but teammates like Rotom-W and Latios that can shore up its bad matchups against Water-types like Seismitoad and Assault Vest Toxapex are good partners. Heatran is unable to immediately threaten Latios and Assault Vest Slowking; teammates like Weavile, Zeraora, and Tyranitar can, though. Wallbreakers like Aerodactyl and Terrakion heavily appreciate Doom Desire support, as the extra hit makes it more difficult for walls to switch in.</p>"

It also puts immense pressure on common walls like Melmetal, Tyranitar, and Rotom-W. Earth Power is needed to significantly dent opposing Heatran, as well as wearing down Pokemon like Toxapex and Galarian Slowking. Magma Storm allows Heatran to spread residual damage, wearing down switch-ins like Hydreigon and Seismitoad. Doom Desire is excellent at facilitating other wallbreakers like Aerodactyl and Keldeo, making it harder for their checks like Mudsdale and Assault Vest Toxapex to switch in. It also forces out pivots like Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Tornadus-T that could otherwise stay in on Heatran. Stealth Rock supports the team and chips Heatran's switch-ins. King's Shield allows Heatran to slowly accrue more Leftovers recovery, increasing its overall longevity, as well as dissuading Cinderace's High Jump Kick and scouting potential Choice item users like Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Buzzwole. Afterwards, Heatran can safely pivot into their appropriate checks. Toxic is a solid alternative that greatly wears down checks like Rotom-W and Seismitoad, making it more difficult for them to switch in reliably. It also works great alongside Magma Storm.</p> <p>If forgoing Leftovers, Air Balloon lets Heatran switch into Ground-types like Mudsdale and avoid Ground-type coverage moves from Pokemon like Melmetal and opposing Heatran. A Timid nature can be used over Modest to outspeed Pokemon like Nidoking and Volcanion. Kyurem is a solid partner that can pressure Heatran checks like Rotom-W, Seismitoad, and Assault Vest Toxapex very well. Heatran pressures the likes of Celesteela, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn in return and can wear down Rotom-H with Toxic. Pivots like Rotom-W and Assault Vest Slowking bait in Ferrothorn for Heatran to take advantage of, and they can lure in and remove Seismitoad with Apple Acid and Grass Knot, respectively. Flame Body as its ability deters physical attackers like Dracozolt, Weavile, and Tyranitar from recklessly damaging it, though Flash Fire can be used to prevent Pokemon like Rotom-H from freely using their Fire-type STAB moves.</p>"

Earthquake and Thousand Waves are usually interchangeable, with Earthquake having more power but Thousand Waves trapping opponents and generating momentum. Additionally, Thousand Waves is not weakened by Grassy Terrain from Rillaboom. Sunsteel Strike lets Excadrill beat Fairy-types and wear down Ground-resistant Pokemon, and Rapid Spin clears entry hazards. Swords Dance makes Excadrill a powerful sweeper in sand, while Shore Up allows Excadrill to take on a more supportive role with Rapid Spin. A Jolly nature lets Excadrill revenge kill Pokemon like Nidoking and Mamoswine outside of sand, but an Adamant Nature provides Excadrill with a ton of power to let it break walls like Buzzwole after just a bit of prior damage. Leftovers is the preferred item to provide passive recovery and offset chip damage from stray hits and Rocky Helmet. Alternatively, Metal Coat makes Sunsteel Strike even more threatening against walls after chip damage. Tyranitar or Hippowdon are mandatory teammates to provide sand. Excadrill requires partners like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Crawdaunt that can deal with both bulky Water- and Ground-types like Slowbro and Hippowdon and its biggest checks, Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory. Dracozolt helps Excadrill overwhelm Ground-types while beating Steel- and Flying-types, making it a staple on sand teams. Defensive Water-types like Toxapex and Slowbro can also help as pivots into Ground- and Flying-types while generating momentum for Excadrill with Flip Turn and Teleport, respectively.</p>"

Seismitoad's excellent defensive profile gives a plethora of opportunities to set up entry hazards, which is why Spikes is preferred over Stealth Rock. However, Stealth Rock is an option if the team already has another Spikes setter. Shore Up allows Seismitoad to stay healthy throughout a game, so that it can check Pokemon like Cinderace and Zeraora long-term. Thousand Waves allows Seismitoad to trap Pokemon such as Toxapex and Tyranitar. Toxic is an alternative to Thousand Waves that punishes switch-ins like Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and opposing Seismitoad, allowing partners like Heatran, Keldeo, and Aerodactyl to potentially break through them. Rocky Helmet can be used to further spread chip damage onto Pokemon such as Zeraora, Cinderace, and Buzzwole, while Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Seismitoad from being pressured by entry hazards while switching in on wallbreakers. Wallbreakers like Cinderace and Aerodactyl pressure Pokemon that want to switch into Seismitoad's Flip Turn, like Ferrothorn and Tornadus-T. 0 Speed IVs and EVs and a Relaxed nature can be used for a slower Flip Turn, underspeeding Pokemon like Clefable to better bring in wallbreakers like Aerodactyl.</p>"

Grav Apple is the primary STAB move, offering consistent damage, allowing Ferrothorn to break through defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Sylveon with repeated Defense drops, and breaking Gyarados's Substitute. Anchor Shot can be used to trap foes like Hippowdon and Zeraora, with stat drops from Grav Apple and Strength Sap heavily helping Ferrothorn remove these targets from play. Knock Off is an alternative utility option that can be used to remove Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Heatran, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-H, cutting into their longevity and making them more vulnerable to Ferrothorn's hazards. Other viable utility options include Toxic, which further cripples switch-ins like Rotom-H but in return leaves Ferrothorn helpless against Steel-types like Corviknight and the aforementioned Heatran, and Aromatherapy, which is useful on defensive teams that benefit from Ferrothorn taking a cleric role. Ferrothorn fits best on balance teams, with defensive Water-types like Toxapex and Slowking offering fantastic type synergy, soaking up strong Fire- and Fighting-type attacks from Cinderace and Keldeo. Ferrothorn deals with threats like Zeraora and Rillaboom in return. Stealth Rock users like Tyranitar and Clefable form a strong hazard core with Ferrothorn, with the former heavily pressuring Rotom-H and also greatly appreciating the chip damage that Spikes provides, while the latter can reliably remove hazards and handle Fighting-types like Buzzwole, which Ferrothorn has trouble with.

It also makes for a solid wincon thanks to Cotton Guard increasing the damage output of Body Press. Spikes synergizes excellently with this strategy, as Ferrothorn can use the threat of boosted Body Press to force out common entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Tornadus-T. Strength Sap allows Ferrothorn to further challenge physical attackers that may otherwise muscle through Cotton Guard boosts. Alternatively, Anchor Shot can be used instead of Spikes, trapping Pokemon like Hippowdon, Clefable, and opposing Ferrothorn that may otherwise exploit an unboosted Ferrothorn to set up hazards. Ferrothorn makes great use of Leftovers's passive recovery, notably using it to avoid a 2HKO from Aerodactyl's Brave Bird. Chople Berry can be run to let Ferrothorn lure in Fighting-types like Urshifu-R, Buzzwole, and Terrakion. Ferrothorn fits best on balance and offense teams that require a blanket check to physical attackers, and their offensive cores can make full use of Spikes chip damage and weaken foes into range of Body Press. VoltTurn Pokemon like Rotom-H and Thundurus-T are therefore great options, as are strong wallbreakers that can remove Heavy-Duty Boots, like Tyranitar and Weavile. Rapid Spin users are also appreciated for removing opposing hazards without removing Ferrothorn's Spikes, with Sylveon and Calm Mind Clefable being two particularly notable examples that also offer a Fighting resistance.</p>"

Close Combat allows Terrakion to blow past walls like Seismitoad and Ferrothorn, with even Pokemon resisting it like Tornadus-T and Clefable taking heavy damage. Diamond Storm reliably threatens the aforementioned Fighting-resistant Pokemon, but also others in Toxapex and Thundurus-T. Potential Defense boosts also make it harder for Pokemon like Cinderace and Zeraora to revenge kill it. Accelerock provides valuable revenge killing against the likes of Gyarados, Cinderace, and Aerodactyl. Earthquake hits Pokemon like Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Gengar harder than Diamond Storm does. Terrakion appreciates pivots like Slowking and Seismitoad that can bring it in safely. Clefable and Melmetal appreciate how well Terrakion pressures Steel-types. Clefable checks physically defensive Buzzwole, while Melmetal can wear down Terrakion checks like Mudsdale with Toxic, making it even more difficult to switch into. Future Sight and Doom Desire support from Slowking and Heatran compound this difficulty, dissuading switch-ins like Toxapex and Clefable, respectively.

Swords Dance alongside No Retreat makes Terrakion immensely more threatening, but if the rest of the team does not pressure Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex well enough, Earthquake is generally the better option. Shuca Berry is an option over Life Orb to set up on Pokemon like Mudsdale, and Lum Berry can be used to avoid status from Clefable and Toxapex. Wallbreakers like Gengar and Thundurus-T appreciate how well Terrakion pressures their checks in Tyranitar, Blissey, and Assault Vest Toxapex.

Poison Fang lets it potentially poison Tornadus-T, Kyurem, and Water-immune foes like Gastrodon and Seismitoad that try to switch into Flip Turn. Scald can also be used to try and deter physical attackers like Zeraora and Tyranitar and Steel-types like Ferrothorn from switching in. Knock Off lets Toxapex pressure the likes of Thundurus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Reuniclus while also doing good damage against Gengar and Slowking. Flip Turn lets it pivot out against wallbreakers it can'(apostrophe)t handle and safely get wallbreakers like Aerodactyl and Nidoking onto the field. Clear Smog lets it prevent sweepers like Calm Mind Clefable and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T from getting out of hand. Due to Toxapex mostly being used to handle special attackers, physical walls like Mudsdale, Cotton Guard Ferrothorn, and Buzzwole make for fantastic teammates as they cover each others weaknesses. Steel- and Dark-types like Corviknight and Tyranitar can also help it against Psychic-type foes like Reuniclus, Latios, and Future Sight Slowking. A Relaxed nature with 64 Defense EVs lets Toxapex avoid getting OHKOed by Zeraora while helping it take on other physical attackers like Rillaboom and Urshifu-R. 0 Speed IVs are used to ensure the slowest possible pivots with Flip Turn.</p>"

Stamina combined with its solid bulk also gives it an edge over other Ground-types like Hippowdon and Seismitoad, as it checks Fire Lash Cinderace. Shore Up lets it stay healthy throughout a game. Stealth Rock or Spikes provide entry hazard support, assisting wallbreakers like Aerodactyl, Clefable, and Reuniclus. Thousand Waves lets Mudsdale threaten the likes of Heatran, Toxapex, and Tyranitar and its trapping effect prevents the opponent from double switching. Body Press takes advantage of the Defense boosts from Stamina and lets Mudsdale force out Ferrothorn after enough boosts are accumulated. Toxic is an alternative that cripples switch-ins like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Rillaboom. Ferrothorn is able to switch in on Seismitoad and Rotom-W and is able to run another move like Cotton Guard or Spikes because Mudsdale already sets Stealth Rock. Knock Off users like Tornadus-T and Clefable remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Corviknight, making it even harder to deal with Mudsdale's entry hazards. Clefable also provides solid entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, keeping Spikes up for other teammates to take advantage of. Teammates that can cover Mudsdales common weaknesses, ranging from strong special attackers like Thundurus-T and Latios to Pokemon with strong super effective coverage like Keldeo and Cloyster, make for good teammates. The likes of Blissey, Heatran, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn all do this job well enough, as well.</p>"

Earthquake allows Buzzwole to beat Toxapex and Galarian Slowking reliably while letting it KO weakened Pokemon without dropping stats, and Ice Punch makes Tornadus-T and Zapdos less safe as checks. Even when boosted, Buzzwole is entirely helpless against Pokemon like Clefable and opposing physically defensive Buzzwole. Therefore, Pokemon like Gengar, Heatran, and Zeraora make for solid partners, with Zeraora in particular overwhelming physical walls for Buzzwole and teammates like Gyarados, Mimikyu, and Scizor.

Thunder Punch hits bulky Water- and Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Gyarados, notably 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex. U-turn lets Buzzwole pivot out on switch-ins like Clefable and Zapdos, letting a teammate like Gengar, Melmetal, or Heatran take advantage of them. Rotom-W forms a solid VoltTurn core with Buzzwole, with Rotom-W forcing in the likes of Ferrothorn and Blissey to pivot Buzzwole in on them, as well as pressuring physically defensive Toxapex. Future Sight and Doom Desire users like Galarian Slowking and Heatran are solid partners to dissuade Pokemon resistant to Fighting, like Toxapex and Tornadus-T, from switching in on Buzzwole. Future Sight's damage also lets Buzzwole break through Clefable. Spikes is incredibly useful for taking advantage of the switches that Buzzwole forces.

Rocky Helmet with the aforementioned Toxic allows Buzzwole to spread enormous chip damage, wearing down walls to pave the way for Pokemon like Cinderace and Aerodactyl to clean up. This set has no way of beating Tornadus-T and Clefable, so Pokemon that can deal with them like Aerodactyl, Melmetal, and Tyranitar are incredibly solid partners. Specially defensive pivots like Slowking and Assault Vest Toxapex cover Buzzwole's weakness to special attackers like Keldeo and Latios, and they form a pivot core with it, making it easier to bring in wallbreakers like Aerodactyl, Tyranitar, and Gengar.

Close Combat is Zeraora's primary coverage move and strongest option for hitting Electric-resistant Pokemon, notably hitting Ferrothorn and Excadrill for super effective damage. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from offensive Thundurus-T and physically defensive walls like Seismitoad and Buzzwole, giving Zeraora a better chance of breaking through them. Leftovers is a viable option over Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing Zeraora to gain passive recovery while setting up, but Heavy-Duty Boots is typically preferred, as Zeraora is often forced into a hit-and-run role until the opposing team is sufficiently weakened.</p> <p>Zeraora is best paired with Spikes support, with Skarmory in particular walling Grass- and Ground-types like Tangrowth and Mudsdale that give it trouble. Seismitoad is also excellent for this role, forming a VoltTurn core with Zeraora and benefiting from its ability to pressure Defog users like Corviknight and Tornadus-T. Rillaboom and Buzzwole are also very strong pivots that pair well with Zeraora, pressuring Ground-types like Gastrodon and Seismitoad while luring in Flying-types that Zeraora can accumulate boosts against. Lastly, Victini can be a great partner, with dual screens giving Zeraora an easier time using Bulk Up while Zeraora offers a safety net against fast breakers like Aerodactyl.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {

Close Combat and Grass Knot are Zeraora's most reliable coverage moves, doing significant damage to many of the tier's Electric-resistant Pokemon, particularly Ground-types like Excadrill, Seismitoad, and Mudsdale. Its ability to force these opponents out allows Zeraora to use Volt Switch with much more ease. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove longevity increasing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Nidoqueen, respectively, as well as minimizing the residual damage taken from Rocky Helmet users such as Buzzwole and Ferrothorn. Knock Off also synergizes well with Volt Switch, with the moves working in tandem to quickly put foes in range of Zeraora's stronger attacks. Toxic is an alternative option that can hit all of the above targets bar Nidoqueen, but the prevalence of Shore Up among Zeraora's switch-ins makes it difficult to maintain chip damage, resulting in Zeraora being much more reliant on its teammates to make progress.</p> <p>Grass Knot still fails to significantly damage Gastrodon in addition to aforementioned Electric-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-H and Thundurus-T, so wallbreakers like Tyranitar, Kyurem, and Latios are fantastic teammates, with Tyranitar in particular greatly appreciating Zeraora's ability to lure and remove physically defensive Ground-types. Keldeo is another strong example, pressuring the above Pokemon and forming a VoltTurn core with Flip Turn and greatly appreciating Zeraora's ability to pressure Water-types like Slowking and Seismitoad. If using Knock Off, reliable entry hazard setters are vital for weakening switch-ins; Skarmory and Ferrothorn fill this role well and provide an answer to Sand Rush Excadrill, one of the few Pokemon in the tier that can reliably outpace Zeraora, while also switching into Ground-types like the aforementioned Seismitoad. Similarly, Tornadus-T can form an excellent VoltTurn core with Zeraora, weakening shared answers like Rotom-H and maintaining damage on physically defensive walls like Clefable and Seismitoad with Taunt.</p>"

High Jump Kick pressures Heatran and does the most damage to Seismitoad and Tyranitar, which can't hit a Fighting-type Cinderace super effectively. Zen Headbutt can deal with Toxapex after a Fire Lash, while Court Change is very useful as a means of entry hazard control, especially against offense teams. Offensive Water-types like Keldeo and Urshifu-R heavily benefit from Cinderace slowly wearing the aforementioned Pokemon down with U-turn and its coverage, allowing them to wallbreak far more effectively. Cinderace can't effectively break Hippowdon, especially if it holds Rocky Helmet, so a strong entry hazard-stacking core with Ferrothorn and Seismitoad is appreciated. Seismitoad can also serve as a slow pivot with Flip Turn to bring Cinderace in more easily. Faster Pokemon like Zeraora and Weavile, Choice Scarf users like Urshifu-R, and Accelerock users like Terrakion and Tyranitar also help Cinderace against faster but frail targets such as Tornadus-T, Aerodactyl, and Alakazam.</p>"

U-turn is good long term for pivoting and dealing small bits of damage, while High Jump Kick and Zen Headbutt hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage. Heatran and Toxapex are the primary targets of those moves, respectively, but both are more risky due to their miss chance and the existence of Ghost-types like Runerigus able to punish the use of High Jump Kick. Choice Band makes Cinderace quite prediction reliant, meaning bulky cores made of Pokemon like Toxapex and Hippowdon can give it some trouble. Future Sight users such as Slowbro and Slowking assist Cinderace greatly, as Pokemon that could switch into Sacred Fire like the aforementioned Toxapex and Hippowdon would then be 2HKOed after taking a Future Sight. Strong wallbreakers like Dragon Energy Latios, Nidoking, and Kyurem can also very easily punch holes in the opposing team after a physically defensive wall like Slowbro is forced to take a U-turn from Cinderace. Without Heavy-Duty Boots, Choice Band Cinderace is very susceptible to opposing entry hazards, especially if a wall like Hippowdon switches in to check it and set them, so entry hazard control from the likes of Corviknight and Clefable also helps greatly.</p>"

Alternatively, the combination of Iron Defense and Body Press can be used to leverage Corviknight's high Defense and deal damage to both offensive Pokemon like Tyranitar and Excadrill and opposing walls like Ferrothorn. Defensive Pokemon like Seismitoad appreciate Corviknight's ability to remove entry hazards and keep them from being worn down by chip damage, while offensive Pokemon like Keldeo, Aerodactyl, and Gengar like its ability to switch into physical hits and pivot them safely in. Corviknight's average Special Defense and weakness to common offensive types Electric and Fire means that it appreciates teammates that are able to absorb hits from common threats like Heatran and Zeraora, such as Thundurus-T, Toxapex, Mudsdale, and Seismitoad.</p>"

Already able to outspeed nearly the entire metagame in sand, including Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Salamence, Dracozolt can outrun nearly any Pokemon with Dragon Dance while boosting its Attack. Dracozolt leverages this massive Speed to double the Base Power of Bolt Beak and tear through walls like Toxapex and Clefable. Dragon Darts hits Dragon-types like Latios and Salamence super effectively, and it hits Ground-types like Seismitoad. Fire Fang allows Dracozolt to threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Excadrill. Substitute can be run instead of Fire Fang to protect Dracozolt from revenge killers and status, making it harder to switch around. If Substitute is run, Leftovers should replace Life Orb to allow Dracozolt more uses of Substitute. Dracozolt is appreciated by slower defensive teammates like Seismitoad and Skarmory for outspeeding and KOing opposing threats. Because Dracozolt relies on sand to perform effectively, a Sand Stream Pokemon like Tyranitar and Hippowdon is necessary. Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Knock Off users like Tyranitar and Tornadus-T can wear down Ground-types, with Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots to rack up Spikes damage, making them easier for Dracozolt to break through. Pokemon like Rillaboom and Rotom-Wash that can switch into Ground-type moves and offensively threaten Ground-types are also valuable, especially since Dracozolt's average defensive stats make it struggle to take hits. Dracozolt is also vulnerable to getting worn down by entry hazards on top of Life Orb recoil, so it appreciates entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Clefable. Excadrill is also a notably good partner for Dracozolt, as they both enjoy sand with Sand Rush and Excadrill can weaken opposing Ground-types for Dracozolt to finish off and vice versa.</p>"

Close Combat lets Urshifu-R threaten Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Melmetal, as well as broadly damaging Water-resistant foes like Hydreigon, Rotom-W, and Seismitoad. U-turn allows Urshifu-R to escape defensive Pokemon it struggles to break through, like Toxapex, while maintaining momentum. No Retreat can be used instead to turn it into a sweeper. However, since Urshifu-R will be unable to switch out after using No Retreat, it is wise to make sure defensive checks like Haze Toxapex have been removed beforehand. Urshifu-R has several options for its last moveslot: Taunt can stop opposing setup sweepers like Reuniclus or prevent Urshifu-R from taking a status move, Aqua Jet allows Urshifu-R to revenge kill weakened foes, notably Aerodactyl, and Thunder Punch gives coverage against Pokemon like Gyarados and Slowking that otherwise don't fear it. Using Protective Pads keeps Urshifu-R safe from chip damage from Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet users, which is especially helpful against Ferrothorn, which could otherwise switch into Surging Strikes and chip Urshifu-R with every hit. Urshifu-R supports teammates like Thundurus-T and Rotom-H that struggle against Tyranitar and Ground-types.
