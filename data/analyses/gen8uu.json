  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is a phenomenal sun sweeper in UU. Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Swampert, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier barring Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence and Azelf or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Scizor. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back. Lastly, priority users such as Zygarde-10%, Scizor, and Mamoswine can pick off a weakened Venusaur. The inconsistency of sun teams because of Hippowdon limits the prominence of Venusaur in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Chansey's Eviolite while also nailing Nihilego and Chandelure, but generally Venusaur benefits much more from its other moves; it can OHKO Nihilego and Chandelure with Earth Power, and after enough boosts from Growth it can damage Chansey with Giga Drain and outheal the damage done by Seismic Toss. Venusaur can run a defensive set with Leech Seed to blank Amoonguss and check Primarina, but generally Amoonguss is the better option thanks to Spore and Regenerator.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: If Venusaur chooses to not run Earth Power, Chandelure can stomach any of Venusaur's hits at +2 and take it out with a Fire-type attack. Rotom-H and Moltres are can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks. Threats who commonly carry Fire-type coverage like Salamence, Hydreigon, and Nidoqueen can take an unboosted hit and KO Venusaur in return.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Special walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Mandibuzz can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns with their recovery moves, with the former wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter two being able to hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. However, Venusaur can outdamage Seismic Toss's damage with Giga Drain if it manages to accumulate enough boosts. Nihilego can take on an unboosted Venusaur but loses if it boosts on the switch-in. Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can take a +2 hit and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, Scizor, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Growth is a powerful setup move under sun, boosting Venusaur's Special Attack by 2 stages and allowing it to 2HKO nearly all the Pokemon in the tier. It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Swampert, and Amoonguss due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Hippowdon, and Lycanroc-D super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Scizor, Skarmory, and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Moltres after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it a powerful force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Hatterene break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Hatterene in particular checks Hydreigon and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey and Flip Turn from Swampert to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Scizor and Azumarill, which are forced out by it under sun.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is a capable entry hazard setter in UU thanks to its offensive potency with Sheer Force and Life Orb, being able to threaten a multitude of UU staples including Hippowdon, Tangrowth, Primarina, and Scizor. Its solid defensive typing also lets it check Pokemon such as Nihilego and Cobalion lacking Iron Head and discourage common Electric-types such as Rotom-H from using Volt Switch. However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would pivot into like Nihilego. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match. Nidoqueen typically faces competition from Hippowdon and Nihilego as Stealth Rock setters thanks to the former's greater bulk and reliable recovery and the latter's greater Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoqueen can utilize Toxic Spikes over Stealth Rock to cripple foes like Hippowdon and Slowking, but Toxic Spikes struggle with the presence of Pokemon who can absorb them like Amoonguss and Nihilego as well as Pokemon immune to them like Salamence, Scizor, and Celesteela. Nidoqueen can run a bulkier set holding Black Sludge, as it can somewhat take advantage of its bulk and defensive typing to better check Cobalion and Rotom-H and do a better job setting up entry hazards, but this set struggles because it is somewhat weak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is the single best answer to Nidoqueen, as it can consistently switch into its attacks without worry, recover any damage away, and chip Nidoqueen with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types and Psychic-type Coverage</strong>: Psychic-types such as Azelf, Necrozma, and Starmie all can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen, with Necrozma being able to live a hit and use it as set up fodder thanks to its high natural bulk. Threats Nidoqueen would normally check like Thundurus-T commonly carry Psychic-type coverage, keeping Nidoqueen from reliably checking them.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: The majority of Water-types in UU can outspeed and OHKO Nidoqueen with ease. Keldeo can outspeed Nidoqueen and OHKO it with Hydro Pump, Rotom-W nearly OHKOes it with Hydro Pump, and Choice Band Crawdaunt and Azumarill OHKO it with Aqua Jet. Slowking and Swampert easily take hits from Nidoqueen and deal heavy damage to it in return.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon tanks Earth Power well and does massive damage with Earthquake.

Fire Blast is an excellent coverage move and the best pick for the last slot, as it wipes out Scizor, almost OHKOes Amoonguss, and cleanly 2HKOes Celesteela.

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent offensive typing, ability in Sheer Force, powerful STAB moves like Sludge Wave and Earth Power, and excellent coverage moves like Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt, Nidoking is a very powerful wallbreaker. It can hit a large portion of the tier for super effective damage, pressuring plenty of Pokemon like Skarmory, Primarina, and Amoonguss. Even though Nidoking is one of the most dangerous threats in the tier, its mediocre Speed tier and bulk mean it can't find many opportunities to wallbreak, mandating pivot support to get it onto the field safely. Nidoking also relies on its Life Orb to do massive damage, so it despises Knock Off from the likes of Nihilego and Thundurus-T. Its typing also doesn't benefit it much defensively, leaving it weak to common attacking types like Ground, Water, and Psychic from Pokemon like Excadrill, Azumarill, and Azelf. Furthermore, despite being a Ground-type, Nidoking doesn't provide a functional Electric immunity for its team, being outsped by Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Thundurus-T and getting hit hard by their other moves. This lack of defensive utility makes it hard to justify over other Pokemon that share its Ground or Poison typing like Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Nihilego. Nidoqueen, while weaker, has more bulk than Nidoking, allowing it to fit Stealth Rock for role compression, and its lower Speed isn't a hinderance in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stealth Rock can be run for role compression thanks to Nidoking preventing common entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Tentacruel from switching into it. While Nidoking's higher Attack might make a physical set worthwhile, it lacks the proper movepool, and most of its Sheer Force-boosted moves are special. Sucker Punch is an option to pick off the likes of Jirachi and Azelf as well as other revenge killers like Lycanroc-D, but forgoing coverage or added utility isn't great for Nidoking. While you forgo the additional power from Life Orb, a Choice Scarf set is a solid revenge killer while still being an effective wallbreaker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Thanks to Chansey's tremendously high special bulk, it is able to switch into any of Nidoking's attacks and can proceed to whittle it down with Seismic Toss, set up Stealth Rock, or recover its HP with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Keldeo and Rotom-W outspeed and threaten Nidoking. Crawdaunt and Azumarill can both effectively revenge kill Nidoking thanks to Aqua Jet. Slowking can tank a Thunderbolt and deal heavy damage with Scald or pivot out into a revenge killer.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon like Diggersby, Excadrill, and Zygarde-10% can comfortably revenge kill Nidoking. Swampert and Hippowdon can switch into most attacks, but must be wary of switching into Earth Power as it can 2HKO. Gastrodon can switch in relatively easily and threaten it.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types and Psychic-type Coverage</strong>: Psychic-types such as Necrozma, Azelf, and Starmie can hit Nidoking super effectively with their STAB moves. Psychic-type Coverage like Psychic on Thundurus-T and Psychic Fangs on Lycanroc-D keep Nidoking from switching into them.</p>",

Earth Power slams Steel- and Poison-types such as Jirachi, Cobalion, and Nihilego. Fire Blast roasts Celesteela, Skarmory, and Scizor. It also OHKOes Amoonguss after Stealth Rock. Thunderbolt allows Nidoking to nail Water- and Flying-types like Slowking, Gyarados, and Mandibuzz. Alternatively, Substitute makes Nidoking much less prediction reliant, giving it free turns against foes that it forces out like Nihilego and Tangrowth. Ice Beam heavily pressures Hippowdon and OHKOes Salamence and Noivern, but these Pokemon get pressured by Nidoking's STAB attacks anyway. A Modest nature should be run to increase Nidoking's damage output against threats like Slowking and Mandibuzz, since it doesn't miss out on any notable Speed benchmarks. Life Orb and Sheer Force pair together to negate the health loss of Life Orb while giving an effective 70% power boost, which is a big factor behind Nidoking's power.</p> <p>Nidoking fits best on offensive teams that are able to bring it in many times to wallbreak and tear through defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Skarmory. As a result, pivots such as Rotom-W, Zarude, and Moltres make for good partners. Zarude forces out Swampert and Hippowdon while Rotom-W lures in Tangrowth for Nidoking and OHKOes Krookodile. Chansey is also a great partner for Nidoking, providing pivot support while beating its common checks like Rotom-W and Hydreigon. Switch-ins to Psychic-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks like Jirachi, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss can be paired with Nidoking on bulkier teams. Jirachi also provides entry hazard support, allowing Nidoking to reliably KO Celesteela, and Healing Wish support to let it wallbreak even more. Tangrowth and Amoonguss are also able to handle Electric-types in the tier much better than Nidoking and can pivot into the likes of Zygarde-10% and Keldeo excellently. Late-game cleaners like Scizor and Cobalion are great teammates to break through Chansey, which Nidoking struggles against. Sticky Web support from Ribombee offsets Nidoking's average Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO threats like Tentacruel, Excadrill, and Lycanroc-D.</p>"

Access to Knock Off alongside Scald and Sludge Bomb make Tentacruel nearly impossible to switch into, threatening foes like Amoonguss with a burn or Slowking with a Sludge Bomb poison. Additionally, it matches up well against common entry hazard setters like Cobalion and Skarmory. Its base 100 Speed lets it outrun and deal heavy damage to offensive threats like Excadrill and Mamoswine. While its Special Defense is excellent, its Defense and HP are fairly poor, making it difficult for Tentacruel to switch into strong physical attackers like Cobalion and Scizor. This is further worsened by Tentacruel's mediocre attacking stats making it difficult to acquire KOs and leaving it overly reliant on status, which worsen its matchup against foes like Azelf, Galarian Slowbro, and Salamence. These weaknesses also put Tentacruel at a disadvantage against other common entry hazard setters like Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Excadrill, which can handle Scald, and make it difficult to remove entry hazards. Tentacruel's lack of recovery severly hinders its ability to check foes it normally would with its typing like Cobalion, Scizor, and even Keldeo, causing other Water-types like Slowking and Primarina to be preffered over it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam hits Dragon-types like Salamence and Hydreigon super effectively. Haze allows Tentacruel to shut down setup sweepers like Calm Mind Primarina, Calm Mind Keldeo, and Autotomize Celesteela, which can take advantage of its passivity.

They all can also easily use Volt Switch on Tentacruel to generate free momentum.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Swampert, and Excadrill easily OHKO Tentacruel with Earthquake, although they don't like having to take a Scald in the process. Seismitoad and Gastrodon are immune to Scald and resistant to Sludge Bomb, which means Tentacruel can only force progress by fishing for poison against them.

Galarian Slowbro is especially troublesome for Tentacruel, as it cannot be poisoned and can easily set up on Tentacruel with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Conkeldurr, Crobat, Zarude, and Gyarados can muscle through Tentacruel due to its poor Defense.

Rapid Spin can provide a boost to Tentacruel's Speed, letting it outspeed common Pokemon like Lycanroc-D, Noivern, and Azelf. Knock Off cripples checks like Chansey, Salamence, and Swampert.

    "overview": "<p>Galarian Slowbro's typing, movepool, and Regenerator give it a very high-value defensive profile while making it deceptively difficult to switch into. Its Poison typing is very useful for avoiding Toxic, while its wide-reaching coverage options like Scald and Flamethrower target Pokemon like Hippowdon, Cobalion, and Scizor. Galarian Slowbro is also very effective at spreading status with Scald and Sludge Bomb, potentially burning foes like Hippowdon and Excadrill or poisoning others like Hydreigon and Slowking. Its Calm Mind set easily sets up on stalwarts like Chansey and Skarmory, sweeping with its solid bulk and multiple boosts. This set's item versatility makes Galarian Slowbro more malleable, as it can use Colbur Berry to improve its matchup against Hydreigon and check Scizor with Flamethrower, Shuca Berry with Scald to lure in threats like Diggersby, and even Safety Goggles to make Amoonguss into setup fodder. Assault Vest sets can scout special attackers such as Primarina and Choice Specs Keldeo, fully stopping them with the help of Water-resistant Pokemon. While it has competition from Slowking as a Future Sight user, it can still support offensive Pokemon such as Zygarde, Thundurus-T, and Lycanroc. However, Galarian Slowbro is plagued with weaknesses to powerful Ground- and Dark-types like Zygarde-10%, Diggersby, and Hydreigon. Its Speed tier means it's almost always the first to take a hit, even from slow Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Conkeldurr. This vulnerability is compounded by its mediocre Special Defense before boosting, which leaves it more open to threats like Choice Specs Primarina and Keldeo. It often relies on its Assault Vest to comfortably pivot into many special attackers, meaning it must be very careful to not switch into Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slack Off + Three Attacks with Colbur Berry is an option to keep Future Sight support while still allowing Galarian Slowbro to check Scizor with Flamethrower. However, this sacrifices the Calm Mind set's ability to clean teams, so it can sometimes be difficult to justify. Grassy Seed on Tapu Bulu teams boosts Galarian Slowbro's Defense, and the Grassy Terrain decreases Earthquake's damage, which makes Galarian Slowbro incredibly difficult to break through reliably. However, it is very committal to switch in and activate the boost, since preserving it means Galarian Slowbro can't escape checks or switch around for Regenerator recovery. Quick Claw alongside Quick Draw can turn Galarian Slowbro into a very dangerous setup sweeper with Nasty Plot, since it can move first in its priority bracket 44 percent of the time. However, this is very inconsistent, and Galarian Slowbro can just as easily provide nothing of value in the match. Trick + Black Sludge over Calm Mind trades Galarian Slowbro's late-game cleaning in exchange for early-game punishment against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Slowking, giving Pokemon like Zygarde-10% and Keldeo an easier time overwhelming them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon threatens to 2HKO Galarian Slowbro and can comfortably tank its attacks. However, it hates status and can even become setup fodder instead if it gets burned. Pokemon such as Excadrill, Diggersby, Mamoswine, and Zygarde-10% can break through Galarian Slowbro even after it sets up, making it difficult to consistently threaten opposing teams. However, Shuca Berry variants can turn the tables on them with a potential Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: Threats such as Choice Specs Hydreigon can blast through Galarian Slowbro's defenses unless it has several boosts. Zarude and Crawdaunt similarly threaten Galarian Slowbro with their physical STAB moves. However, none of them can reliably beat Galarian Slowbro one-on-one due to the risk it gets around them with Colbur Berry and/or status. Assault Vest sets also cannot scout Knock Off users like Nihilego and Azelf, as it values its item heavily.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro's dependence on multiple boosts to be a threat leaves it open to Pokemon such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Conkeldurr, which can weaken it to the point that it won't find adequate opportunities for setup.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Status</strong>: Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro often needs to be at high health to fulfill its role, while Calm Mind sets can struggle to set up properly in the face of residual damage, making both incredibly vulnerable to Spikes, Stealth Rock, and sand chip damage. Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro also heavily dislikes Amoonguss's Spore, as it can struggle even more to find opportunities to burn sleep turns, and sleep increases the already-substantial number of turns it needs to be a significant threat. Being burned while checking Slowking and Primarina also becomes an issue in conjunction with the other forms of residual damage, hindering Galarian Slowbro's ability to check them long-term.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Galarian Slowbro gains opportunities to start boosting from forcing out foes like Tangrowth and Skarmory. Sludge Bomb is Galarian Slowbro's usual STAB move for poisoning Pokemon like Slowking and Mandibuzz. Psyshock can be used instead to KO Amoonguss and Conkeldurr more easily, though it forgoes pressure against foes like Hatterene and Togekiss. Scald complements Sludge Bomb brilliantly because it nails Poison-resistant Pokemon like Hippowdon and Nihilego while threatening to hinder their longevity with burns. Burning Hippowdon is particularly useful, since it becomes setup fodder. Flamethrower complements Psyshock by KOing Scizor and dealing significant damage to Zarude. However, pairing these moves does leave Galarian Slowbro much more open to Hydreigon, which dislikes Sludge Bomb. The combination of Sludge Bomb + Flamethrower is effective at hitting Hydreigon and Hatterene while maintaining coverage against Scizor and Cobalion, but it sacrifices Galarian Slowbro's matchup against foes like Nidoqueen and Hippowdon while giving up a lot of pressure against checks like Zygarde-10% and Diggersby. Colbur Berry helps Galarian Slowbro against foes like Hydreigon and Zarude and lets it offensively check Scizor with Flamethrower. Shuca Berry helps Galarian Slowbro deal with Diggersby with Scald and potentially get a crucial burn against Zygarde-10% or Hippowdon. Safety Goggles lets it ignore Spore and Stun Spore from Amoonguss and use it as setup fodder. Black Sludge can be useful for easier setup and offsetting sand chip damage, but it forfeits some ability to overwhelm Galarian Slowbro's checks. Maximum Defense investment is used to better handle Pokemon like Cobalion and Scizor; Calm Mind will boost Special Defense anyway.</p> <p>Galarian Slowbro functions well on balance, bulky offense, and semi-stall teams, which appreciate its potential to sweep teams while providing solid defensive utility and longevity. Entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Skarmory handle dangerous offensive Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Excadrill, and Mamoswine. Skarmory is also a solid Zarude answer and can be the primary Scizor answer if Galarian Slowbro lacks Flamethrower. Fast Pokemon like Noivern and Keldeo help deal with offensive teams for Galarian Slowbro, revenge killing wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Nidoqueen. Galarian Slowbro helps them out by breaking through bulkier teams, setting up and tearing down walls like Chansey and Skarmory. Other offensive Pokemon like Swords Dance Cobalion and Scizor can set up on Galarian Slowbro checks, like Zarude and Hippowdon, while serving as revenge killers. Galarian Slowbro can deal with Pokemon like Primarina and Togekiss one-on-one but can't switch into them very safely, especially Nasty Plot variants of the latter if lacking Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Rotom-W make for good primary answers to Keldeo, Primarina, and Togekiss, preventing them from overwhelming Galarian Slowbro. Tangrowth also checks Zygarde-10%, while Rotom-W can remove entry hazards for Galarian Slowbro, lure in Pokemon like Tangrowth for easy Calm Mind setup, and beat Hippowdon. Galarian Slowbro has problems dealing with entry hazards over the course of a longer game; removal options like Salamence work well to not only alleviate this, but also helps deal with Pokemon like Excadrill and Diggersby. On semi-stall teams, Articuno is also a very good option, completely stifling Hippowdon's and Skarmory's entry hazards while bleeding their PP with Pressure. Other special walls on defensive teams, like Chansey and Umbreon, help patch up Galarian Slowbro's matchup against wallbreakers like Nidoking, Noivern, and Salamence. Umbreon also checks dangerous threats like Excadrill, Zygarde-10%, and Azelf.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Shell Side Arm targets the Defense stat of Calm Mind users like Hatterene and Primarina, severely damaging them, while retaining good odds to poison enemies. Future Sight amplifies the wallbreaking capabilities of teammates like Keldeo, covering their switch-ins like Amoonguss and Salamence. If the team doesn't need Future Sight support, Scald is an alternative that prevents Pokemon like Excadrill, Hippowdon, and Nidoqueen from easily switching in. Ice Beam hits Pokemon like Thundurus-T, Hydreigon, and Salamence. Psyshock is a STAB option that immediately threatens more foes, like Nihilego and Keldeo. Flamethrower threatens Scizor and Cobalion. Slack Off over Future Sight lets Galarian Slowbro check Nihilego and Tangrowth more reliably after getting its item removed, but this sacrifices a large portion of its offensive utility and is useless before item removal. Assault Vest allows Galarian Slowbro to survive powerful attacks such Nidoking's Earth Power and Hydreigon's Dark Pulse and retaliate. Galarian Slowbro uses a Quiet nature with 16 Special Attack EVs, since the bulk from a Sassy nature and/or 12 more Special Defense EVs is overkill in practice, and the better long-term damage is more valuable. The bulk is still enough to avoid being 2HKOed by Choice Specs Keldeo's Scald and survive Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. Quiet is picked over Modest to not interfere with Shell Side Arm's damage.</p> <p>Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro fits on balance and bulky offense teams. These may heavily value a reliable pivot into special attackers like Salamence and Rotom-W that also doesn't give dangerous Pokemon like Calm Mind Primarina room to set up, as well as scouting what move Keldeo will lock itself into. Entry hazards help build chip damage against checks like Chansey and Hippowdon, and setters like Cobalion and Nihilego check Knock Off users like opposing Nihilego and Thundurus-T. They also greatly appreciate Future Sight support, as it punishes their switch-ins such as Hippowdon and opposing Cobalion, and both can repel Future Sight switch-ins such as Zarude, Hydreigon, and Mandibuzz. Wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Keldeo adore Future Sight heavily punishing their switch-ins like Skarmory and Amoonguss. They also prevent Future Sight switch-ins like Hydreigon and Mandibuzz from entering safely. Cleaners like Zygarde-10% and Diggersby appreciate Galarian Slowbro crippling shared checks like Hippowdon and Celesteela with status, letting them overwhelm them. Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Primarina, and Zarude deal with Ground-types like Zygarde-10%, Mamoswine, and opposing Hippowdon. Hippowdon can also set entry hazards, Primarina counters Hydreigon and provides a safety net for Keldeo's Hydro Pump, and Zarude provides momentum with U-turn for easy Future Sight setups on Amoonguss. Galarian Slowbro enjoys having Water-resistant teammates like Salamence and Primarina because it has issues repeatedly handling opposing Choice Specs Keldeo's and Primarina's Hydro Pump. They also benefit Galarian Slowbro by checking Excadrill and Hydreigon, and the former acts as a great entry hazard remover to keep Galarian Slowbro as healthy as possible.</p>"

Its naturally high Defense lets it set up on physical attackers such as Zygarde-10%, Mamoswine, and Excadrill. After a Shell Smash boost, Cloyster can threaten many top UU threats such as Hippowdon, Salamence, and Amoonguss, with only a select few Pokemon able to revenge kill it at +2. However, Cloyster's lackluster Special Defense stat and initial speed prevent it from setting up against offensive teams with powerful special attackers such as Azelf, Nihilego, and Thundurus-T. Even at +2 Speed, Cloyster is outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Zarude and Hydreigon. Cloyster cannot fit coverage for both Slowking and Primarina, and it just cannot get past checks such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Tentacruel. It is vulnerable to priority moves such as Lycranroc-D's Accelerock and Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, and can have its sweep cut short by status, Life Orb recoil, and entry hazards.</p>",

However, Poison Jab is an option to KO certain Water-types such as Primarina and Azumarill. It also hits Keldeo and Rotom-W for greater damage. Hydro Pump is run to OHKO physically defensive Pokemon such as Cobalion and Skarmory after a boost. Life Orb secures these OHKOs, but it can severely cut into Cloyster's longevity. White Herb is an alternative that restores Cloyster's defenses back to normal after Shell Smash, limiting its vulnerability to Scizor's Bullet Punch and potentially letting it boost again. A Naughty nature gives Cloyster maximum Attack without weakening Hydro Pump, as it does not care about decreasing its already low Special Defense.</p> <p>Cloyster is primarily a late-game cleaner on hyper offense teams, which are great at weakening its checks. Cloyster appreciates a dedicated suicide lead, such as Excadrill or Scolipede, to set up entry hazards and rack up chip damage on threats such as Celesteela and Swampert. Excadrill's Stealth Rock also disables Skarmory's Sturdy, and it can remove hazards with Rapid Spin, alleviating Cloyster's weakness to them.

In addition, Chansey can withstand certain physical attacks from threats like Zygarde-10% and cripple them with Toxic. Chansey is hard to wear down, since it has Soft-Boiled for HP recovery and Natural Cure to remove status ailments, allowing it to be a status sponge into the likes of Amoonguss, Slowking, and Swampert. Chansey possesses a trove of valuable utility moves such as Teleport, Thunder Wave, Aromatherapy, and Stealth Rock to support its team. However, Chansey is rather passive, as it relies on Seismic Toss and Toxic to deal damage. As a result, many Pokemon such as Scizor, Excadrill, Skarmory, and Cobalion easily take advantage of Chansey. Without Teleport, Chansey is a huge momentum drain for non-stall teams. Chansey's typing provides few useful resistances, and Chansey by itself must rely on its bulk to keep threats in check. Chansey is vulnerable to every entry hazard, meaning it gets overwhelmed by them quickly. Chansey is also susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would normally check like Azelf and Thundurus-T, as without Eviolite, it is harder for Chansey to keep threats like Zygarde-10% and Choice Specs Hydreigon in check.</p>",

Toxic helps Chansey wear down the enemy team, especially against bulky foes like Salamence, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth. Teleport is a great support move to bring other teammates safely onto the battlefield and to keep up momentum on more offensive teams. Since Chansey has little to fear from many special attackers, it can force switches and get many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Chansey can use Aromatherapy to act as a cleric; however, this is usually only considered on balance and stall teams. Thunder Wave can be used instead of Toxic to support slow teammates like Conkeldurr and cripple Scizor and Cobalion, but it makes Chansey weaker against bulky Pokemon and has less use overall. Wish is a helpful option to heal teammates, especially those without a reliable recovery move like Mamoswine. Maximum investment in Defense and HP alongside a Bold nature allows Chansey to check Azelf and Hatterene as well as weaker physical attackers such Hippowdon more effectively.</p> <p>Chansey can fit on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams as a sturdy wall for special attackers. Sturdy physical walls such as Tangrowth and Skarmory can check threatening wallbreakers such as Lycanroc-D, Diggersby, and Mamoswine for Chansey. In return, Chansey checks strong special attackers such as Nidoking, Moltres, and Primarina. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Hydreigon and Zygarde-10% appreciate Teleport Chansey's ability to bring them safely onto the battlefield. Since entry hazards limit Chansey's ability to switch into attacks and force it to recover more, entry hazard control from Salamence, Skarmory, and Excadrill is crucial. Umbreon and Quagsire can check threatening setup sweepers like Gyarados, Scizor, and Galarian Slowbro, with Umbreon also offering Wish support to Chansey's teammates and a check to physical threats such as Zygarde-10%, Mamoswine, and Jirachi. Ditto is also an option to keep offensive setup sweepers like Azumarill and Gyarados in check. A good Knock Off absorber such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, or Cobalion is helpful, as Chansey needs Eviolite to better switch into attacks. Amoonguss is also able to check Keldeo and Azumarill. The common presence of Scizor means Chansey needs counters to it in order to function; Defensive Salamence, Iron Defense Skarmory, and Iron Defense Registeel are all helpful in handling it.</p>"

Starmie's wide coverage allows it to force many switches, and its ability Analytic severely punishes nearly all of them. Starmie's access to Recover also allows it to use its typing to check common foes like Celesteela and Keldeo throughout a game. However, while Starmie's Analytic-boosted attacks can hit exceptionally hard, Starmie's unboosted attacks are not too powerful and can be shrugged off by many Pokemon like Scizor, Rotom-W, Chansey, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Furthermore, Starmie is prone to being worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, forcing it to use Recover more than it would like and limiting its effectiveness as a wallbreaker. Starmie's vulnerable typing and frailty causes it to be easily revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users like Diggersby and Hydreigon.

Its Stealth Rock weakness also makes it an unreliable Defogger against the more common Taunt variants of Stealth Rock Krookodile, given Knock Off and Articuno's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, although Krookodile still fears Freeze-Dry when using Taunt. Without a second hazard remover such as Flygon alongside Articuno, Spikes teams often rely on using the overwhelming threat of their own hazards to win the hazards war, forcing the opponent to remove these hazards instead of setting their own. Due to its typing, Articuno can also be exploited or set up on by threats like Scizor, Cobalion, and Nihilego, which only fear a freeze from repeated Freeze-Dry usage, mandating solid defensive support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Haze is an option to check Pokemon such as Calm Mind + Rest Primarina and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro, but Articuno can struggle to fit it over Heal Bell, which is required to beat Hippowdon. Articuno can be run on VoltTurn teams with U-turn over Heal Bell, letting it maintain momentum and generate switch-in opportunities for threats such as Diggersby and Chandelure while Defogging for them. Articuno also provides these teams a key switch-in to Primarina, which they struggle to fit when using Zarude as their Grass-type. Articuno can optionally run Heal Bell instead of U-turn on these structures to reliably Defog against Hippowdon and support teammates such as Scizor, letting it be more aggressive with switching into Slowking's Scald and attacking Moltres, but losing U-turn leaves Articuno much more passive.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Due to its low power and lack of coverage, Articuno can be setup fodder for Steel-types such as Scizor and Cobalion. In addition to this, Steel-types such as Cobalion, Excadrill, and Jirachi are Stealth Rock setters Articuno cannot beat. Celesteela takes little damage from Freeze-Dry despite not resisting it and can pressure Articuno heavily, and Iron Defense Skarmory can boost up against and beat Articuno to keep Spikes up. Skarmory must, however, be wary of Freeze-Dry damage due to its poor Special Defense, and non-Iron Defense variants are unable to keep Spikes up versus Articuno, since they can't threaten it enough with Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Nihilego</strong>: Nihilego can shrug off any damage Articuno can throw at it with its massive special bulk, reliably keeping Stealth Rock up against it, while forcing Articuno out with its Rock-type STAB moves. Nihilego can use the multiple free turns Articuno gives it to either debilitate key teammates with Knock Off + coverage or set up with Meteor Beam.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Stealth Rock</strong>: Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock leaves it uncomfortable against Krookodile, which can remove its Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and potentially stop it from Defogging with Taunt and good prediction, but it must be wary of Freeze-Dry. Pokemon like Azelf and Tangrowth that Articuno can usually check are able to force it out with Knock Off if they are paired with an entry hazard setter that Articuno's team cannot beat.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus-T cannot switch into Articuno safely, given its Ice weakness, but can threaten Articuno with its Electric-type moves and Knock Off. Raikou also pressures Articuno with Thunderbolt. Rotom-H can shrug off anything Articuno can throw at it, but it can't directly harm Articuno without Nasty Plot due to its low Special Attack.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Freeze-Dry lets Articuno threaten Pokemon such as Primarina, Amoonguss, and Zarude. Its 10% freeze chance is low at face value, but adds up over a long game versus threats like Scizor, which commonly switch into it, due to its high PP. Defog alongside Pressure lets Articuno beat entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Chansey one-on-one, and even against teams with other setters, its defensive profile lets it Defog on Pokemon like Primarina and Amoonguss. With Heal Bell and Pressure, Articuno can safely PP stall any one Pokemon's Toxic while offering key cleric support to teammates, opening up superior move options on teammates such as Toxic on Umbreon and Stealth Rock on Chansey. 56 Speed EVs let Articuno outspeed Choice Specs Primarina, and high Special Defense investment with a Calm nature helps it check Pokemon such as Primarina and Salamence. Articuno can opt to run 204 Defense EVs instead with a Bold nature to improve its matchup versus Dragon Dance Gyarados and Salamence, but this should only be done on teams without Umbreon to handle them, as it lowers Articuno's ability to switch into Defog Salamence as reliably.</p> <p>Articuno fits primarily on semi-stall and stall teams that appreciate a Defogger that beats Hippowdon solo while compressing Heal Bell support. Skarmory is a fantastic fit alongside it, checking Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Swords Dance Scizor with Iron Defense. Skarmory values Articuno letting it run Spikes over Defog, as well as bleeding the PP of Defog users such as Salamence and Mandibuzz, helping its Spikes stay up more easily. Defensive wallbreakers such as Taunt Jellicent, Hex Chandelure, and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro appreciate Articuno enabling Spikes Skarmory, helping them break through opposing teams. Jellicent, in particular, provides key defensive value as a check to threats such as Keldeo, Cobalion, and Scizor, and it appreciates Articuno clearing it of status it may pick up from Pokemon like Skarmory and Amoonguss, while Galarian Slowbro can double up as a late-game wincon and appreciates Articuno checking Hippowdon. On full stall teams, secondary Defog users such as Skarmory and Flygon cover entry hazard setters Articuno cannot beat. Iron Defense Skarmory can help beat Excadrill and opposing Skarmory, while Flygon can counter Nihilego and beat pivot Thundurus-T and opposing Skarmory. Primary special walls such as Umbreon and Chansey are important to check threats such as Moltres and Chandelure and not have Articuno overwhelmed by Salamence and Primarina. Umbreon can offer Wish support to Articuno and check threats such as Swords Dance + Knock Off Scizor, while Chansey can provide a Stealth Rock setter. Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Quagsire can check Pokemon such as non-Grass Knot Thundurus-T and Nihilego, and Rotom-H for Articuno. Hippowdon can also provide Stealth Rock support and a Hatterene answer with its Rocky Helmet sets, while Quagsire can reliably counter Pokemon like Swords Dance Cobalion and Scizor and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Moltres stands out as a solid offensive pivot thanks to U-turn complementing its good STAB combination and its ability to check tier staples like Scizor, Amoonguss, Skarmory, and Excadrill. Flame Body makes Moltres great at punishing the many U-turn users of the tier, including Scizor, Crobat, Zarude, and Diggersby. Moltres can also function as a solid support Pokemon with its Mystical Fire + Toxic set, wearing down Pokemon like Slowking, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W to support teammates like Mamoswine. Heavy-Duty Boots greatly improves Moltres's efficiency at its roles, but it is extremely reliant on them, making it very susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would normally check like Mamoswine, Tangrowth, and especially Scizor. Teams with Moltres often have to run entry hazard removal so that Moltres can properly check these threats. Moltres can also be taken advanatage of by pivots it checks like Scizor, Crobat, and Diggersby to bring in threats like Nihilego, Primarina, and Keldeo if it does not proc the Flame Body burn. Salamence gives Moltres heavy competition because of its better typing, Intimidate, and greater resilience to Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moltres can run Defog for role compression thanks to it matching up well against entry hazard setters like Excadrill and Skarmory, but it suffers from poor matchups against other common setters like Nihilego, Hippowdon, and Chansey. Dropping U-turn severely limits Moltres's offensive potential as well. A Substitute + Toxic set with an EV spread of 152 HP / 132 SpD / 224 Spe, a Timid nature, and Pressure can be used to cripple and PP stall many of Moltres's counters, such as Hippowdon, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W, but it makes Moltres very passive in general. Scorching Sands threatens Nihilego for massive damage, but that's it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off and Stealth Rock</strong>: Moltres becomes extremely vulnerable to Stealth Rock upon losing its Heavy-Duty Boots. Pokemon that usually lose to Moltres, such as Scizor, Tangrowth, and Conkeldurr, can take advantage of this by using Knock Off against Moltres as it switches in. The former two do fear getting burned by Flame Body, however.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Nihilego and Rhyperior can easily tank Moltres's STAB moves and blow it away with massive damage, though the latter does have to be wary of Toxic. Lycanroc-D outspeeds and OHKOes Moltres with Stone Edge. Cobalion, a Pokemon that Moltres is supposed to check, often carries Stone Edge, making it hard for Moltres to switch into. Pokemon that Moltres can normally check, such as Excadrill and Tapu Bulu, may sometimes carry Rock-type coverage moves, forcing Moltres to scout these attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Raikou, and Thundurus-T can easily take advantage of Moltres with Volt Switch. The former two are especially good counters thanks to resisting Fire.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Primarina, Swampert, and Slowking can tank Moltres's attacks and deal big damage back with their STAB attacks, though the latter two do not like Toxic. Keldeo can outspeed Moltres and OHKO it with Hydro Pump, but it cannot switch into Moltres safely. Gyarados can take a Hurricane and use Moltres as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Hippowdon, Umbreon, and Chansey easily tank Moltres's STAB attacks and have reliable recovery; however, Hippowdon greatly dislikes Toxic, and Moltres can easily take advantage of Umbreon and Chansey via U-turn.</p>",

Cobalion is a particularly good partner for Moltres, as it acts as a secondary check to Scizor, potentially forms a VoltTurn core with it, and checks Nihilego and Chansey. Toxic Cobalion luring in Hippowdon creates opportunities for Moltres to get past it. Zarude, Swampert, and Slowking deal with Pokemon like Hippowdon and Keldeo for Moltres while also forming momentum cores with it. Scizor also creates a momentum core and pressures Moltres checks like Chansey, Slowking, and Nihilego. Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and the aforementioned Zarude take on threatening Water- and Electric-types like Primarina, Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T for Moltres. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Nihilego is useful for helping Moltres break through Slowking. These Pokemon can also check Thundurus-T and Rotom-H.

  "Crobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Crobat acts as a fast offensive pivot thanks to its incredible natural Speed, allowing it to outspeed fast offensive Pokemon like Azelf, Zygarde-10%, Keldeo, and Noivern. Crobat can make use of its high Speed and offensive pivoting with STAB Brave Bird and U-turn to outlast checks such as Nihilego and Rotom-W, making it threatening to many common team styles. Taunt prevents would-be checks like Salamence, Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Chansey from recovering while also preventing the latter two and Amoonguss from using status moves. While Crobat's Poison / Flying typing allows it to switch in on Grass- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Zarude, Amoonguss, and Conkeldurr, it must beware switching directly into a status move like Stun Spore or Spore from Amoonguss, or strong attacks like Darkest Lariat from Zarude and Knock Off and Facade from Conkeldurr. Furthermore, Crobat's average bulk makes it struggle to switch in on strong attacks from offensive Pokemon like Hydreigon, Azelf, and Zygarde-10%. Crobat's lack of relevant resistances also makes it fear moves from Pokemon it would otherwise check, such as Facade from Conkeldurr and Hydro Pump from Keldeo. Lastly, Crobat is dependent on Heavy-Duty Boots to be effective, forcing it to play carefully against Knock Off users like Diggersby and Scizor. This flaw also forces Crobat to think twice about switching into Knock Off users it would otherwise counter like Tangrowth.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Inflitrator can be used instead of Inner Focus to allow Crobat to bypass Substitute, preventing Pokemon like SubCM Keldeo and Primarina from getting a safe hit on Crobat from behind a Substitute. Defog can be used over Taunt to make Crobat an entry hazard remover. However, foregoing Taunt limits Crobat's offensive potency and stops it from keeping Stealth Rock off the field against some common setters, like Cobalion, Hippowdon, and Nihilego. Hypnosis can be used in the final moveslot to cripple switch-ins, although it suffers from low accuracy and opportunity cost in not using the more reliable Taunt. A set of Nasty Plot, Sludge Bomb, Heat Wave, and Roost can be used to break through Crobat's usual Steel-type checks, and it provides excellent Fire / Poison coverage against most of the UU tier. This set is particularly effective against bulkier teams due to the aforementioned coverage, Crobat's reliable recovery, and its Toxic immunity. However, this set can be hard to justify over Crobat's usual utility. In addition, Crobat's base Special Attack is low, so this set usually requires multiple Nasty Plot uses to break through its targets. Finally, Super Fang could be used over U-turn and alongside Taunt to weaken sturdy Crobat checks like Celesteela for its teammates. This turns Crobat into a dangerous stallbreaker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Celesteela, Skarmory, and Jirachi take very little damage from Brave Bird and can hinder Crobat. Skarmory can lose one-on-one against Crobat due to Taunt preventing it from healing with Roost, but it would still damage Crobat significantly in the process, especially if Skarmory is holding a Rocky Helmet. Cobalion does not resist Brave Bird, but it's never 2HKOed thanks to its great physical bulk, and it can threaten Crobat with Stone Edge or Volt Switch and chip it with Rocky Helmet as well. Scizor also does not resist Brave Bird and does not like switching into it, but it can revenge kill a weakened Crobat with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Crobat's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots makes Knock Off a giant threat to its longevity, making it dangerous to switch into Pokemon like Tangrowth and Krookodile, which would otherwise be less threatening.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Raikou, Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H resist Crobat's Brave Bird and threaten heavy damage or OHKOs on it. They can be worn down over time with repeated hits, however, and are not safe switch-ins at low HP.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Nihilego, Lycanroc-D, and Rhyperior resist Brave Bird and threaten heavy damage on Crobat. Rhyperior in particular stonewalls Crobat. While Lycanroc-D and especially Nihilego take more damage from Brave Bird and must be more careful about switching into Crobat, they can survive a hit from it and revenge kill in return. Lycanroc-D also has priority Accelerock to prevent Crobat from hitting it first.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Hippowdon and Swampert can take repeated hits from Crobat without fearing a KO. Swampert can use Flip Turn to pivot into a Pokemon that can threaten Crobat, while Hippowdon mandates Taunt use with Slack Off and forces sand chip damage. Both can also hit Crobat with a super effective Earthquake if it is forced to use Roost, and Hippowdon can potentially punish Brave Bird and U-turn with Rocky Helmet. Hippowdon will usually fail to beat Taunt Crobat one-on-one, but Rocky Helmet and sand can significantly chip Crobat in the process. Slowking can also comfortably take a Brave Bird and threaten heavy damage with Psychic.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Brave Bird allows Crobat to maintain offensive presence with a strong STAB attack, threatening heavy damage on fast, frail offensive Pokemon like Azelf, Zygarde-10%, and Keldeo. U-turn lets Crobat escape Pokemon it cannot meaningfully damage, like Jirachi and Celesteela. U-turn also wears down switch-ins and offensive checks like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, Raikou, and Nihilego, allowing Crobat to beat them long-term. Roost keeps Crobat healthy, allowing it to last in long games, beat bulky threats like defensive Salamence and Chansey one-on-one, and utilize its typing to switch into Zarude. Roost can also be used to remove Crobat's Flying typing for a turn, reducing its damage from moves like Volt Switch from Rotom-W and Rotom-H and Stone Edge from Cobalion. Roost also helps compensate for the recoil damage Crobat takes from using Brave Bird. Taunt lets Crobat shut down status moves from Pokemon like Amoonguss and Chansey, as well as healing attempts from Pokemon like Salamence and Skarmory. Even if Crobat itself does not fear Toxic from Pokemon like Chansey and Hippowdon, its teammates may appreciate Taunt shutting down the threat of Toxic after they switch in. Taunt can also prevent Defog attempts from Pokemon like Salamence and Mandibuzz. Inner Focus is the preferred ability, as it prevents Salamence from lowering Crobat's Attack with Intimidate upon switch-in, and it additionally makes Crobat immune to flinches from attacks like Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse and +1 Speed Jolly Gyarados's Waterfall. Maximum Speed investment and Jolly are necessary to keep Adamant Dragon Dance Gyarados and Adamant Choice Scarf Diggersby in check.</p> <p>Crobat pairs well with other pivots like Zarude, Thundurus-T, Rotom-H, and Rotom-W to keep momentum up. These can also bring Crobat in safely against targets like Amoonguss, reducing Crobat's need to use Roost often. Rotom-H and Rotom-W make particularly good partners, as Crobat appreciates them checking Mamoswine and Steel-types like Scizor and Celesteela. Ground-type teammates like Hippowdon and Excadrill absorb Electric- and Rock-type moves aimed at Crobat from Pokemon like Rotom-H and Nihilego, respectively. Knock Off absorbers like Amoonguss and Tangrowth prevent Crobat from losing its Heavy-Duty Boots. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can also check Electric-types like Thundurus-T and Raikou for Crobat. Wallbreakers like Choice Specs Hydreigon and Keldeo pair well with Crobat, as Crobat can bring them in against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Celesteela with U-turn.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Lanturn's typing, Volt Absorb, and Heal Bell make it one of the most reliable Rotom-W and Rotom-H counters for stall teams, and an excellent switch-in to Celesteela and Salamence. It blocking Volt Switch from the former two, while checking Thundurus-T very reliably, mitigates the damage VoltTurn teams can output versus defensive teams. Heal Bell is a crucial tool for stall teams and frees up moveslots on teammates like Umbreon and Chansey. Volt Switch lets Lanturn maintain momentum when checking Pokemon such as Rotom-W and worry less about predicting switch-ins. Lanturn can alternatively run Thunderbolt, leveraging its typing and special bulk for a fantastic matchup versus a premier stallbreaker in Nasty Plot + Heal Bell Togekiss. The momentum from Volt Switch and status spreading from Scald + Toxic makes Lanturn difficult to safely switch into: checks such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Hydreigon easily get crippled. However, its lack of reliable recovery leaves it reliant on Wish support from teammates like Umbreon and occasional Volt Absorb recovery, limiting how easily it can switch in to use Heal Bell throughout the match. Lacking recovery also stops Lanturn from being a primary check to Pokemon such as Primarina. Lanturn lacks significant immediate damage against Nasty Plot Thundurus-T variants, often having to trade itself for a Toxic and some Scald damage so its teammates can take it down. Similarly, it can't meaningfully hurt Zarude, limited to a Volt Switch pivot on the switch or forcing the occasional Jungle Healing with status. Finally, Lanturn's physical bulk leaves a lot to desired, preventing it from checking Pokemon such as Cobalion, Keldeo, and Scizor outside of emergencies, typically forcing Water-type teammates such as Slowking and Jellicent alongside it.</p>",

Zarude's Jungle Healing allows it to shrug off anything Lanturn can throw at it although long-term, though it may waste more Jungle Healing PP than it would like against Lanturn and teammates such as Scald Slowking and Toxic Umbreon. Amoonguss can threaten Lanturn with Spore and Sludge Bomb; Tangrowth can likewise win one-on-one comfortably, but it must be more wary of Toxic and Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While they cannot comfortably switch into Lanturn's Scald, Ground-types such as Excadrill, Mamoswine, Zygarde-10%, and Diggersby can all force Lanturn out with their powerful STAB moves.

Thunderbolt is an alternative if one fears the matchup versus Nasty Plot + Heal Bell Togekiss, but it should not be used otherwise. Scald punishes switch-ins such as Amoonguss with burns and prevents Ground-types like Excadrill and Diggersby from safely switching in. It also directly damages Thundurus-T. Heal Bell lets Lanturn reliably counter Toxic Rotom-W and support its teammates. Toxic lets Lanturn punish switch-ins such as Tangrowth and offensively pressure Pokemon it checks such as Rotom-W and Thundurus-T. Volt Absorb lets Lanturn block Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Thundurus-T, potentially offsetting its lack of recovery when doing so. Due to said lack of recovery, Leftovers is preferred over Heavy-Duty Boots. Even with Stealth Rock up, Lanturn will still break even on HP when switching into a Pokemon and forcing it out. 124 Speed EVs allow Lanturn to outspeed Adamant Azumarill and Conkeldurr and land Volt Switch. The rest of the EVs are put into its special bulk to improve its matchup versus Thundurus-T.</p> <p>Lanturn fits on stall teams that appreciate the cleric support and reliable answer to Volt Switch users it provides. Wish support is mandatory alongside Lanturn to offset its lack of reliable recovery. Umbreon is a prime teammate for this, capable of checking Ground-types such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Zygarde-10% for Lanturn, as well as Pokemon like Nasty Plot Azelf. Lanturn should be paired alongside other checks to dangerous special attackers such as Hydreigon, Nihilego, and Primarina, as its lack of recovery leaves it as a last-resort option in this role. Chansey is an ideal option that appreciates Lanturn running Heal Bell, which lets it run Stealth Rock to help wear down Pokemon switching into Lanturn's Volt Switch, and being a primary switch-in to Volt Switch users like Rotom-W, which could wear Chansey down over time alongside entry hazards. Due to Lanturn not running Heavy-Duty Boots, it greatly appreciates having reliable entry hazard removal. Teammates such as Salamence and Skarmory can offer this while dealing with bad matchups such as Zarude, Cobalion, and opposing Skarmory. Skarmory can also check threats such as Conkeldurr and Azumarill with Iron Defense. Slowking can reliably answer Keldeo for Lanturn and provide a dangerous potential wincon with Calm Mind. Lanturn's Heal Bell support lets Slowking more freely check Pokemon such as Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro, and it can more readily take status, such as Toxic from Hippowdon, to make progress more easily. Celesteela can reliably answer Calm Mind Hatterene and check Ground-types like Diggersby.</p>"

Access to great coverage moves such as Knock Off and Ice Punch lets Azumarill break past Pokemon like Tentacruel and Amoonguss that would otherwise check it by resisting its STAB combination, while Aqua Jet allows it to also be a great revenge killer against top threats like Zygarde-10% and Azelf that have taken chip damage. Azumarill also has decent natural bulk and a great defensive typing, which allows it to blanket check threats such as Hydreigon and Salamence. Unfortunately, Azumarill is quite slow, so it is easily forced out by faster Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Thundurus-T when it is not boosted with Belly Drum. Additionally, Rotom-W and faster Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Zarude can revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill, as they can stomach a +6 Aqua Jet. This gives Azumarill limited opportunities to fire off an attack due to its only decent bulk. Belly Drum Azumarill is restricted to only getting one setup opportunity, which usually forces it to be preserved until late-game. Azumarill faces large competition from Primarina as it offers more defensive utility with its bulk and doesn't have to deal with Rocky Helmet damage from physical walls like Skarmory and Amoonguss.</p>",

Protective Pads lets Azumarill not worry about being chipped by Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Amoonguss, but its wallbreaking prowess is significantly hindered.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Faster Grass-types like Zarude and Tapu Bulu are the biggest threats to Azumarill because even a Belly Drum Azumarill cannot OHKO them with Aqua Jet and they OHKO back. Defensive Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth can usually switch into Choice Band Azumarill and threaten it with their own STAB moves as well as scout and switch out with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: An unboosted Azumarill is easy prey for Thundurus-T and Raikou. Without being at +6, Azumarill cannot come close to KOing them with Aqua Jet, and both will in turn OHKO Azumarill. Rotom-W resists Aqua Jet and can also outspeed and cripple Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp or pressure it with an Electric-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Faster Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Anything faster that resists Aqua Jet is bound to pressure Azumarill. These Pokemon include Gyarados, Tentacruel, and Rotom-W. Salamence can also pressure Azumarill, but it is also pressured by Azumarill with Play Rough, so Azumarill would have to be significantly chipped for Salamence to KO it.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Liquidation lets Azumarill muscle past Hippowdon, Celesteela, and Chansey. Play Rough is Azumarill's main attack to remove foes like Zarude, Primarina, and Slowking. Aqua Jet becomes a very powerful STAB priority move when bolstered by Huge Power and a Choice Band, allowing it to OHKO Nihilego and revenge kill Thundurus-T and Rotom-H after they have taken sufficient chip damage. Ice Punch allows Azumarill to break through Amoonguss by 2HKOing it on the switch. It also hits Tangrowth hard. Knock Off can be used to burden anything that switches in, such as Tangrowth and Tentacruel, by removing their item. A Choice Band allows Azumarill to maximize the wallbreaking potential its STAB attacks have to offer. Adamant is the preferred nature to make it as strong as possible, notably 2HKOing Skarmory with Liquidation after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill fits best on bulky offense teams as a powerful early-game wallbreaker. Pivots like Thundurus-T and Scizor can bring Azumarill in against their checks like Nihilego and Moltres to fire off an attack. Nidoking, Moltres, and Salamence can remove bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Tapu Bulu for Azumarill to fire off its STAB attacks easier. Keeping entry hazards up is important to ease Azumarill's ability to break through Tangrowth and Skarmory, so partners such as Excadrill and Nihilego are essential. The former provides entry hazard removal to keep Azumarill from getting worn down while the latter offensively checks Thundurus-T. Tapu Bulu and Zarude threaten to revenge kill Azumarill, as they are faster and resist Aqua Jet, so partners like Salamence and Amoonguss that can comfortably switch into them are ideal. Having a good Electric-immune teammate, such as Swampert or Hippowdon, helps deal with Electric-types like Rotom-W and Thundurus-T.</p>"

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>A +6 Aqua Jet will KO almost anything that doesn't resist it, so it is very hard for anything to revenge kill Azumarill. Play Rough pressures slower threats like Slowking and RestTalk Primarina after a boost, as it can OHKO anything that does not resist it, including a fully defensive Tangrowth. A boosted Knock Off will OHKO Amoonguss and defensive Celesteela. Sitrus Berry allows Azumarill to set up more reliably and puts it at a comfortable amount of HP after a Belly Drum. 4 HP is needed to activate Sitrus Berry after Belly Drum. Adamant is the preferred nature to guarantee an OHKO on Amoonguss with Knock Off.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill fits best on hyper offense teams due to its nature as a late-game cleaner and need for dedicated support. Krookodile and Excadrill provide entry hazard support to put threats like Tentacruel and Skarmory in range of Azumarill's attacks while also providing an Electric immunity. Similarly, Ribombee can provide Sticky Web support to offset Azumarill's vulnerable Speed tier, allowing it to now outpace Tentacruel and Tapu Bulu. Once Azumarill is boosted with Belly Drum, it typically will not get another chance to do so, so removing faster Water-type resists is key. Good offensive teammates include Salamence and Gyarados to help take out foes like Zarude and Keldeo. Thundurus-T pressures Skarmory, Scizor, and Mandibuzz for Azumarill and provides a valuable Electric immunity. Early-game sweepers like Scizor and Azelf can pave the way for an Azumarill sweep by removing threats to Azumarill like Tangrowth and Keldeo.</p>"

A Water / Ground typing allows Quagsire to act as a Volt Switch absorber while also checking Pokemon such as Rotom-H and Lycanroc-D. As such, these attributes make Quagsire a staple on stall teams. However, Quagsire's 4x weakness to Grass makes it unable to check Pokemon such as Nihilego, Gyarados and pivot Thundurus-T, as they commonly carry Grass-type coverage. Quagsire's bulk only goes so far, as very strong wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt and Azumarill can break through it with minimal effort. Finally, Quagsire's poor special bulk leaves it unable to take on special attackers well, leaving it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Keldeo.</p>",

It provides fantastic team utility as a Wish passer, getting plenty of opportunities to heal up its teammates versus Pokemon like Azelf and Salamence. While unable to pressure some defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Teleport Chansey at all, Umbreon can freely use them to pass Wish, and Foul Play + Toxic greatly punishes many offensive checks switching in and prevents Umbreon from being too passive. However, it can offer a lot of opportunities to dangerous Fairy- and Fighting-types like Primarina, Cobalion, and Conkeldurr that can greatly threaten bulkier teams. Umbreon also struggles versus some of the stronger special attackers in the tier like Thundurus-T and Meteor Beam Nihilego, and chip damage can bring it into 2HKO range of Pokemon it checks like Mamoswine and Nidoking.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm nature is an option to prevent Nidoking from 2HKOing Umbreon after Stealth Rock. This, however, makes Umbreon unable to check Mamoswine and more damaged by Pokemon like Excadrill and Dragon Dance Gyarados. Heal Bell is an option that lets Umbreon clear status from itself and its teammates. However, dropping Toxic for it makes Umbreon noticeably more passive and invites offensive Pokemon in, giving it far fewer opportunities to safely pass Wish. Therefore, it should only be used on teams with absolutely no better options against status.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Cobalion, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr are some of the biggest threats to Umbreon. Conkeldurr can be deterred by Umbreon stalling for burn damage, but Drain Punch variants can easily regain their HP versus Umbreon's teammates, forming a long-term threat. Cobalion's Toxic immunity and ability in Justified let it safely switch into Umbreon as well.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Defensive Primarina variants can easily wall Umbreon and sponge Toxic while pressuring its teammates. For non-defensive sets, Umbreon can outspeed and poison Substitute + Calm Mind variants or scout Choice Specs variants, but the former sets up for free if not immediately poisoned, and the latter poses a serious threat to Umbreon's teammates. Hatterene can easily set up on Umbreon, bouncing back Toxic. While Togekiss cannot beat Umbreon without Heal Bell due to Inner Focus, Heal Bell + Nasty Plot variants can set up provided they have enough Heal Bell PP remaining.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Crawdaunt is a huge threat to Umbreon thanks to its titanic damage output and resistance to Foul Play. Zarude's resistance to Foul Play and ability to sponge Toxic with Jungle Healing make it a great pivot into Umbreon; however, it cannot easily beat Umbreon itself unless Umbreon has wasted a lot of PP, and Zarude must be careful to not waste too much Jungle Healing PP if it needs check a teammate like Slowking. Choice Specs Hydreigon can easily overwhelm Umbreon if it switches into Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Nidoking can easily get the edge versus Umbreon if it has been chipped by entry hazards, lost its Leftovers to Knock Off from a Pokemon like Nihilego or Mamoswine itself, or statused. While Umbreon still avoids being 2HKOed by Life Orb Mamoswine without its Leftovers, Stealth Rock makes the 2HKO decently likely. Modest Nidoking can 2HKO Bold Umbreon with Stealth Rock up, forcing it to waste passive turns on Protect, which can be easily predicted.</p>",

Wish alongside Protect keeps Umbreon and its teammates healthy. Protect is also useful to scout Choice-locked Pokemon, like Primarina and Keldeo, and absorb attacks from Pokemon like Cobalion and Conkeldurr paired with Future Sight from Slowking. Inner Focus lets Umbreon avoid flinches from Pokemon it checks, like Mamoswine, Gyarados, and Jirachi, and check non-Heal Bell variants of Togekiss. Maximum Defense investment with a Bold nature lets Umbreon avoid the 2HKO from Mamoswine's Earthquake after Stealth Rock while improving its matchup versus Pokemon like Excadrill.</p> <p>Umbreon predominantly fits on balance, semi-stall, and stall teams as a fantastic check to threatening Pokemon like Azelf and Gyarados, as well as key team support through Wish. Hippowdon and Skarmory can check threats like Conkeldurr and Tapu Bulu for Umbreon. Skarmory can also provide an additional Excadrill check, Spikes support, and an Azumarill check. Slowking can check Keldeo and Primarina for Umbreon, while Umbreon checks Zarude and Hydreigon for it. Cleric support is vital, as Umbreon gets easily statused by Pokemon it checks like Hippowdon. Togekiss is a great option that can help check Hydreigon and provide an extra wincon with Nasty Plot versus the bulkier teams Umbreon struggles to make progress against, as well as checking Conkeldurr.

These traits, combined with Teleport, allow Slowking to consistently force progress against many teams by allowing wallbreakers such as Thundurus-T and Zygarde-10% to enter the field safely. Due to its incredible bulk and typing, Slowking can easily come in on threats like Keldeo, Cobalion, Celesteela, Excadrill, and Nihilego and then pivot to a revenge killer with Teleport. However, as a result of its somewhat below average physical defense, Slowking is unable to consistently wall strong physical attackers such as Conkeldurr and Swords Dance Excadrill. Slowking also gets forced out by threats such as Zarude, Hydreigon, and Thundurus-T quite easily due to its initial passivity and can get overwhelmed by status from Pokemon it checks like Toxic from Moltres and Sludge Bomb poisons from Nihilego. Slowking's typing also holds it back, as it is weak to U-turn as well as Knock Off. Slowking competes with Chansey for the role of a defensive pivot, as Chansey isn't weak to foes such as Hydreigon. Slowking also competes with Primarina, which has a better defensive typing and a better matchup against Hydreigon.</p>",

Counter is another option over Teleport that can punish Pokemon like Zarude and reflect damage from U-turn users. Thunder Wave cripples common answers such as Hydreigon as well as Meteor Beam Celesteela while still punishing Keldeo. However, running it instead of Psyshic STAB leaves Slowking vulnerable to Primarina and Conkeldurr. Running Thunder Wave over Teleport is also fine, as long as the team has enough pivot support. This can open some doors for teammates like Conkeldurr and SubToxic Jirachi, as Conkeldurr is faster than paralyzed Hydreigon and Zarude, and Jirachi outspeeds revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Zarude if they are paralyzed. A Trick Room + Teleport Slowking set can be used as a teammate for slow wallbreakers like Alolan Marowak and Conkeldurr on semi-Trick Room teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Zarude and Hydreigon wall Slowking due to their Psychic immunity and Scald resistance. Zarude is an especially good answer to Slowking, as it can heal off Scald burns via Jungle Healing.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth threaten Slowking immensely with their supereffective attacks. In particular, Tapu Bulu can OHKO Slowking or use it as setup fodder, but it should be wary of Scald.

Electric-type coverage like Thunderbolt on Starmie and Thunder on Reuniclus keep Slowking from switching into them.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status forces Slowking to use Slack Off more often. Chansey is difficult for Slowking to overcome, as it can cripple Slowking with Toxic and shrug off Scald burns with Natural Cure. Slowking is also vulnerable to status from Pokemon it checks, such as Toxic poison from Excadrill and Moltres, Sludge Bomb poisons from Nihilego, and Scald burns from Primarina.</p>",

Additionally, Psychic discourages Conkeldurr from staying in to use Knock Off. Future Sight can be used instead to support Slowking's wallbreaking teammates. In addition to being an excellent pivot move, Teleport works well with Future Sight to bring in an offensive teammate such as Conkeldurr to capitalize on Future Sight absorbers, which are mainly Dark-types. Psyshock can be used over Psychic or Future Sight to prevent Slowking from becoming setup fodder for Calm Mind + Substitute Primarina and Meteor Beam Nihilego, though it makes Slowking more vulnerable to Conkeldurr. Colbur Berry allows Slowking to avoid an OHKO from Conkeldurr's Knock Off, improve its matchup against Mamoswine, and give it the ability to pivot against Hydreigon with Teleport. However, Heavy-Duty Boots can instead be used to keep Slowking from getting worn down by Spikes and Stealth Rock. 0 Speed IVs let Slowking underspeed opposing Slowking and gain momentum with a slower Teleport. 56 Special Defense EVs with a Sassy nature improve Slowking's matchup against foes such as Primarina and Moltres; however, it should be noted that this worsens Slowking's matchup against Zygarde-10%.</p> <p>Slowking fits best on bulky offense, VoltTurn, and balance teams that appreciate its ability to tank special attacks and pivot in strong wallbreakers. Frail wallbreakers such as Zygarde-10% and Thundurus-T appreciate Slowking's ability to safely pivot them onto the field via Teleport. These teammates also enjoy Future Sight pressuring Amoonguss and Nihilego. Slowking forms an excellent defensive core with Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth, which appreciate its ability to switch into Fire-type attacks and check Poison-types such as Tentacruel. In return, they can come in on Grass- and Electric-types like Tapu Bulu, Zarude, and Thundurus-T that force out Slowking. Slowking forms a strong pivot core with Moltres, with Moltres pressuring Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu and Slowking checking foes such as Keldeo. Slowking appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Excadrill, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-H. Skarmory is also a good teammate for Slowking, as it checks Zarude easily and helps against Mamoswine, Conkeldurr, and Scizor.

Scald helps Slowking threaten switch-ins such as Hydreigon and enemy Slowking with burns. Psyshock helps against Chansey, opposing Slowking, Calm Mind Primarina, and Galarian Slowbro.

Nihilego is more offensively potent and provides Knock Off support, whereas Chansey has more longevity and can also provide cleric support instead of setting Stealth Rock. However, while teams using Calm Mind Slowking want cleric support, keeping Slowking burned helps it set up in front of Chansey and Swampert without fear of Toxic. Quagsire provides an Electric immunity and checks Pokemon like Swords Dance Scizor and Belly Drum Azumarill.Defensive Salamence and Skarmory are great assets for their ability to answer Grass-types like Zarude and Zarude while providing Defog support.

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor's potent defensive typing, amazing utility in Knock Off and U-turn, reliable recovery in Roost, and useful ability in Technician for Bullet Punch make it one of UU's scariest cleaners and best pivots. Scizor's dominance stems from its set versatility and ability to fit on nearly every playstyle, ranging from hyper offense to balance. Scizor's 3 Attacks + Roost set provides near-unmatched utility as a pivot that can nearly always make progress by crippling switch-ins like Salamence and Celesteela with Knock Off and enabling threats like Azelf with U-turn, all while having Roost to check threats like Tangrowth and Zarude throughout a game.  Meanwhile, Scizor's bulky Swords Dance set is notorious for being a strong late-game cleaner that can take advantage of common Pokemon like Zarude, Chansey, and Hippowdon to boost its Attack while also being a great revenge killer against Zygarde-10% and Nihilego, as well as having the longevity to outlast checks like Celesteela and sweep when the time is right. Scizor's offensive Swords Dance set focuses on going all out and steamrolling past defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth and Chansey while easily sweeping past Hydreigon and Mamoswine with its boosted attacks. All of these factors make Scizor quite tough to handle in the builder, possibly exploiting Skarmory and Cobalion with U-turn as well as potentially outlasting hard checks like Salamence, opening up its team. However, Scizor is not without its flaws. Its poor Speed and average Special Defense leave it susceptible to strong special attackers like Keldeo and Thundurus-T. Cleaning with Bullet Punch isn't always easy due to the prevalence of faster Steel-resistant Pokemon like Cobalion, Rotom-W, and the aforementioned Keldeo and Thundurus-T. This relegates Scizor to item displacement and pivoting for the early- to mid-game, as it is unable to immediately make progress on its own. Scizor also has a horrific weakness to Fire-type attacks, leaving it limited by common coverage moves from threats such as Galarian Slowbro, Celesteela, Azelf, and Salamence. Common defensive Pokemon like Skarmory and Amoonguss can be used to scout nearly all of Scizor's attacks, making it easier to distinguish what set it is running. Scizor struggles to fit all the moves it would like, wanting Swords Dance to sweep late-game, Knock Off to cripple switch-ins like Salamence, and U-turn to pivot away from unfavorable matchups.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scizor can use a Choice Band set for great power right from the get-go, wearing down threats like Amoonguss and Keldeo with powerful a U-turn and revenge killing Azelf easier with a strong Bullet Punch, but it requires extensive support to keep it from getting worn down by entry hazards and Rocky Helmet chip from Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Cobalion. Superpower on the bulky Swords Dance set allows Scizor to heavily damage a common counter in Cobalion, but Scizor prefers the utility Knock Off or U-turn provides. Defog is an option for bulky Scizor sets on stall teams as a secondary entry hazard remover due to it outlasting entry hazard setters like Swampert and providing valuable defensive utility with its Steel typing, but this set is very passive, and stall generally prefers Defoggers like Salamence and Articuno instead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory and Cobalion are great switch-ins to Scizor, as they resist Bullet Punch and U-turn and can wear it down with Rocky Helmet. Both Iron Defense Skarmory and Swords Dance Cobalion can overcome bulky variants of Scizor by boosting alongside it. Celesteela hates Knock Off but OHKOes Scizor with Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Moltres and Rotom-H outspeed and OHKO Scizor, but they have to watch out for Knock Off removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Fire-type coverage on the likes of Salamence, Azelf, Hydreigon, Nidoqueen, and Colbur Berry Galarian Slowbro wipes out Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus-T, Rotom-H, and Raikou all resist Bullet Punch and can hit Scizor hard in return. Rotom-W can cripple Scizor with Will-O-Wisp but loses to bulky Swords Dance variants.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types like Keldeo and Starmie resist Bullet Punch and can revenge kill Scizor by hitting it hard with their STAB attacks, though the latter needs Scizor to be decently chipped at risk of getting hit hard by Knock Off. Gyarados also resists Bullet Punch and can boost with Dragon Dance as it forces Scizor out.

It also allows Scizor to threaten Chansey and removes Rocky Helmet from Cobalion and Skarmory that would wear Scizor down, though it has to worry about giving free Justified boosts to Cobalion. Dual Wingbeat is an option over U-turn that lets Scizor lure in and nail Amoonguss and Keldeo. Roost gives Scizor the longevity to handle Zarude, Hippowdon, and Nihilego.

Other pivots like Azelf and Zarude make for solid teammates; the former threatens Steel-types like Skarmory and Cobalion, while the latter can help overwhelm Amoonguss and counter Rotom-W and enjoys Rocky Helmet being removed from Skarmory. Hippowdon, Nihilego, and Nidoqueen provide Stealth Rock support for Scizor to wear down Amoonguss and Rotom-W easier. Scizor's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from checks like Salamence and the Stealth Rock setters' ability to keep Stealth Rock up against nearly every form of entry hazard removal dramatically increases Scizor's potency. Hippowdon and Nihilego also handle threats to Scizor like Thundurus-T and Salamence. Defensive walls like Amoonguss and Slowking can take on threats to Scizor like Keldeo and Salamence while also being helpful for keeping Scizor from getting overwhelmed by Zarude and Nihilego. The latter can also provide a slow pivot with Teleport to get Scizor in safely against Pokemon like Tangrowth.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance + Bullet Punch turns Scizor into a potent revenge killer and late-game sweeper capable of taking out fast threats like Nihilego, Zygarde-10%, and Azelf with a strong priority attack. Knock Off is essential in crippling the likes of Celesteela, Moltres, and Salamence, causing them to lose out on passive recovery or take damage from Stealth Rock, allowing Scizor to possibly overcome them in the long run. U-turn can be used over Knock Off for powerful pivoting while still retaining sweeping abilities, being able to pressure Amoonguss a lot more easily as well as bring in teammates like Azelf to handle counters like Skarmory and Cobalion. However, Scizor must be paired with another Knock Off user such as Tangrowth or Diggersby to cover for Scizor dropping it. Moreover, Swords Dance + U-turn is walled by dangerous threats like Celesteela and Salamence, which no longer fear Knock Off crippling them and can handle Scizor more easily. Roost maintains Scizor's longevity, letting it check Nihilego, Zarude, Tangrowth, and Mamoswine throughout a game while preparing itself to sweep. It also has benefits in PP stalling Amoonguss out of Foul Play. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Scizor from getting worn down by entry hazards and being forced to use Roost. Meanwhile, Rocky Helmet is an option to chip threats like Zarude, Cobalion, and Diggersby, while Safety Goggles lets Scizor act as a switch-in to Amoonguss by denying it Spore or Stun Spore and beating it one-on-one, though this has few other applications. Heavy investment in HP and Defense allows Scizor to set up against and take on physical attackers like Zarude, Excadrill, and Zygarde-10%. It also decreases the damage taken from Amoonguss’s Foul Play and allows Scizor to take advantage of Cobalion lacking Swords Dance.</p> <p>Bulky Swords Dance Scizor best fits on bulky offense, VoltTurn, and balance teams that appreciate a late-game sweeper that provides integral defensive utility against threats like Tangrowth and Mamoswine. Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego and Hippowdon are valuable teammates; not only do they provide entry hazards to wear down the likes of Amoonguss and Celesteela, they also beat checks to Scizor like Moltres, Rotom-H, and Salamence. Special attackers like Hydreigon and Keldeo appreciate Scizor countering Chansey and can shatter Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Skarmory that stand in Scizor's way. Rotom-W and Thundurus-T are solid teammates that can pressure Flying-types like Celesteela, Mandibuzz, and Skarmory. Fast pivots like Azelf, Crobat, and Raikou take on revenge killers that threaten Scizor like Keldeo and Cobalion, especially appreciating U-turn bringing them in. These Pokemon provide useful revenge killing utility to Scizor's team in general because of how weak Bullet Punch is without setting up.</p>"

      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Bullet Punch covers Scizor's usual targets like Nihilego, Togekiss, and Mamoswine. After a Swords Dance, it can easily pick off faster threats like Hydreigon and Zygarde-10% as well as bulkier foes like Hatterene and offensive Salamence after the latter has taken slight chip. The rest of the moves can be tailored to the needs of Scizor's team. Knock Off nails the likes of Slowking and Thundurus-T while being a good midground against Hippowdon and opposing Scizor. It also punishes Moltres and Rotom-H attempting to switch into Scizor. Alternatively, Technician-boosted Quick Attack lets Scizor pick off faster Pokemon resistant to Bullet Punch like Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Rotom-W, though they do have to be fairly worn down. Dual Wingbeat does heavy damage against Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Zarude, OHKOing them after a boost. It also covers Hippowdon well. However, Superpower lets Scizor break past Steel-types like Celesteela, Cobalion, and Skarmory, while Bug Bite retains super effective damage on Tangrowth and Zarude while also hitting Slowking and Umbreon hard, though it leaves Scizor walled by Cobalion as a result. Life Orb allows Scizor to maximize its wallbreaking potential, since it has limited longevity anyway.</p> <p>This set best fits on hyper offense teams that appreciate Scizor's potent late-game cleaning potential and ability to revenge kill faster threats like Azelf even when low on HP. It also has the ability and the prowess to prevent fast threats such as Lycanroc-D, Zygarde-10%, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon from running over hyper offense teams. Entry hazard support from Excadrill, Froslass, and Scolipede is key in softening up Celesteela and Primarina for Scizor to get past. Excadrill can also remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, while Scolipede can heavily chip threats like Cobalion with Endeavor. Gyarados makes a great partner for Scizor, taking advantage of Scizor luring in Keldeo and Moltres for free setup. Similarly, Meteor Beam Nihilego can wipe out annoyances to Scizor like Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-H. Necrozma is able to use common Scizor counterplay such as Cobalion, Skarmory, and even Rotom-H as setup bait. Early-game wallbreakers and sweepers like Thundurus-T and Autotomize Celesteela can overwhelm Mandibuzz, Salamence, and Hippowdon for Scizor. Azelf, in particular, revenge kills many threats to Scizor like Cobalion and Keldeo.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Skarmory is one of the key defensive pillars of UU thanks to its sky-high Defense, reliable recovery, and amazing defensive typing, checking dangerous offensive threats like Excadrill, Zarude, Scizor, and Gyarados with ease. Skarmory has a bevy of utility moves. Spikes wears down defensive threats like Hippowdon and Chansey for its team, and Skarmory can set Spikes easily thanks to its defensive utility and good matchup versus Excadrill. Furthermore, Whirlwind prevents Pokemon like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance Scizor from setting up, while Iron Defense alongside Body Press allows Skarmory to improve its matchup versus threats like Azumarill, Swords Dance Scizor, and Conkeldurr. Skarmory can even run Defog on stall teams thanks to its great matchup against entry hazard setters like Excadrill and Hippowdon. These traits, in addition to its synergy with top defensive picks like Amoonguss, Slowking, and Chansey, allow Skarmory to fit on a wide range of archetypes ranging from bulky offense to stall. However, Skarmory has an extremely vulnerable Special Defense stat, making it a Steel-type that can't check specially offensive Fairy- and Psychic-types like Hatterene, so it faces competition from other Steel-types like Celesteela. Common threats like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Moltres also limit Skarmory's consistency due to its passivity. Skarmory also often struggles to fit all the moves it likes at once. For example, it wants Iron Defense to be reliable in a 1v1 last Pokemon scenario versus Scizor, but it then becomes extremely passive and unable to punish Defog users such as Moltres and Salamence without Toxic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Skarmory can compress both Spikes and Defog on more defensive teams, acting as an emergency Defog option and opening up moveslots for other teammates. Skarmory can replace its attacking moveslot to fit both, or even other combinations of utility moves. It is still able to beat Excadrill as long as it keeps Rocky Helmet. However, these sets are very team specific. Skarmory can attempt to compress entry hazards by running both Spikes and Stealth Rock, but it struggles to fit Stealth Rock over more valuable options like Whirlwind or Toxic and pairs well with Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Common Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H all are unbothered by Skarmory and can use it to gain momentum with Volt Switch. Thundurus-T can also boost with Nasty Plot as it forces Skarmory out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Fire-types like Chandelure and Moltres come in easily on Skarmory and force it out. Skarmory must also be wary of Pokemon like Celesteela, Salamence, and Azelf due to them commonly running Fire-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers like Keldeo, Primarina, and Hydreigon can all break through Skarmory due to its poor special bulk. Hatterene in particular completely walls Skarmory, denying its entry hazards and ignoring Whirlwind and Toxic with Magic Bounce.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Iron Defense allows Skarmory to better check Pokemon such as Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Scizor by boosting its Defense, and it increasing Body Press's damage makes Skarmory more threatening in front of foes such as Hippowdon and Mandibuzz. Roost maintains Skarmory's health and keeps it steadfast against strong attackers like Conkeldurr and Zygarde-10%. Spikes allows Skarmory to support its team, easily setting them up against common Pokemon such as Amoonguss, and the additional chip damage is helpful against Pokemon like Keldeo. Alternatively, since Skarmory has great matchups against entry hazard setters like Excadrill and Hippowdon, Defog is useful to consistently remove their hazards while forcing them out. Rocky Helmet is helpful to punish Excadrill's Rapid Spin and other physical attackers like Zarude and Diggersby. Safety Goggles is an alternative option to allow Skarmory to fully counter Amoonguss, setting up Iron Defense or Spikes without needing to use a teammate as sleep fodder. However, this forces Skarmory to avoid taking Knock Off from foes like Mamoswine and Scizor in order to ignore Spore. 96 Speed EVs allow Skarmory to outspeed Azumarill.</p> <p>Iron Defense Skarmory fits on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams for handling physical threats such as Scizor while either setting Spikes to wear down foes for its teammates or reliably negating common entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Swampert. Spikes Skarmory complements other hazard setters like Nihilego and Hippowdon excellently. Both teammates check dangerous threats like Thundurus-T and Moltres, and they also help maintain hazards against hazard removers Skarmory cannot handle, like Salamence. Teammates such as Slowking and Chansey form excellent defensive cores with Skarmory thanks to their ability to check dangerous special attackers like Keldeo and Hydreigon. Slowking can act as a wincon on stall teams with Calm Mind, while Chansey can act as a cleric. Tangrowth provides additional support for Skarmory to ensure Zygarde-10% or Rotom-W does not overwhelm it. Tangrowth also absorbs Knock Off so Skarmory does not have to risk its own Rocky Helmet or Safety Goggles. Articuno can be paired with Skarmory on hazard stacking semi-stall teams to bleed the PP of hazard removers such as Salamence and Mandibuzz. Alternatively, Articuno can pair up with Defog Skarmory in a double Defog core, keeping entry hazards off almost indefinitely. Quagsire can check Rotom-H while providing backup against Dragon Dance Salamence. In return, Skarmory helps Quagsire against the Grass-types in the tier and threats like Gyarados. Hatterene enjoys Spikes pressure chipping Pokemon like Excadrill and Skarmory being a reliable check to Scizor. Hatterene's Magic Bounce also helps Skarmory avoid being worn down by opposing entry hazards. Other offensive teammates include Calm Mind Slowking and Galarian Slowbro, which enjoy Spikes support wearing down threats like Amoonguss and Hippowdon while checking foes like Zarude and Diggersby.</p>"

It also keeps Hydreigon from coming in freely. Alternatively, Brave Bird lets Skarmory hit Conkeldurr, Keldeo, and Amoonguss super effectively and deal solid damage to Azumarill and Gyarados. Spikes wears down common defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Amoonguss, and Hippowdon. Skarmory has plenty of opportunities to set Spikes up against Pokemon that typically cannot threaten it, like Jirachi and Tangrowth. Toxic cripples threats like Moltres and Thundurus-T that typically have free entry on it, and hinders Defoggers like Salamence and Mandibuzz from removing Spikes in the long run. Alternatively, Whirlwind can be used due to its great synergy with Spikes, forcing chip damage on switch-ins like Primarina. It also prevents setup sweepers like Gyarados and Belly Drum Azumarill from setting up. Skarmory can run Defog on stall teams thanks to its ability to handle entry hazard setters like Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Swampert. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to punish pivoting attempts from Swampert, Diggersby, and Zarude, prevent Excadrill from freely using Rapid Spin, and wear down threats like Azumarill and Gyarados quickly. The given Speed EVs allow Skarmory to outspeed Azumarill and Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Skarmory best fits on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams that appreciate its Spikes support and walling capabilities. Chansey makes an excellent partner for Skarmory, taking on dangerous special attackers like Hydreigon, Moltres, and Thundurus-T, while Skarmory handles physical attackers like Excadrill and Diggersby. Slowking similarly checks Moltres and special Salamence, and it also acts as a secondary check to Conkeldurr and Mamoswine with Colbur Berry. Additionally, its Future Sight alongside Skarmory's Whirlwind can hinder offensive Pokemon like Thundurus-T. Stealth Rock setters like Hippowdon, Nihilego, and Excadrill form great entry-hazard stacking cores with Skarmory. Nihilego beats Moltres and Thundurus-T and can hinder Scizor with Knock Off to make it vulnerable to Spikes, while Excadrill can pressure Hatterene and remove opposing entry hazards without compromising Skarmory's own Spikes. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth make good secondary checks to Tapu Bulu and Conkeldurr so Skarmory doesn't get overwhelmed checking them. They also can absorb Knock Off for the team, allowing Skarmory to preserve Rocky Helmet and chip down Diggersby. Zarude and the aformentioned Grass-types can help take on strong Electric- and Water-types like Rotom-W and Primarina as well. Powerful wallbreakers like Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Zygarde-10% all appreciate Skarmory's Spikes wearing down checks like Tangrowth and Chansey. On stall teams, Quagsire can provide an Electric immunity to block Volt Switch and check Thundurus-T. It also can handle setup sweepers that can bypass Skarmory like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Scizor. Umbreon acts as a primary check to Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados, secondary check to Mamoswine, and way to beat Chandelure.</p>"

Being a fast pivot makes Raikou hard to wear down and allows it to bring in threatening Pokemon like Keldeo to wallbreak. It has multiple coverage moves that hinder switch-ins; Scald chips Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Swampert and threatens them with a potential burn, while Aura Sphere nails Zarude and Hydreigon. However, Raikou has limited defensive utility due to its average bulk and typing. Its frailty is also worsened by its offensive limitations, as it has a hard time breaking through foes like Hippowdon and Nihilego and gets completely stopped by Amoonguss, Chansey, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. It also struggles to trade with common offensive threats, such as Nidoqueen and Zarude. Because of this, Thundurus-T is generally the superior choice, being stronger, having more versatile coverage, and also providing better typing that can make up for it being slower than Raikou.</p>",

Calm Mind + Substitute makes it a late-game sweeper that can also stall out Pokemon like Amoonguss with Pressure, but the presence of Hippowdon, Zarude, and Assault Vest Tangrowth makes this set unreliable and hard to get going. Calm Mind + Volt Switch is another set Raikou can run, but it is usually overshadowed, as the extra damage isn't enough to break through Raikou's counters while also keeping up good momentum.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Nidoqueen block Volt Switch from Raikou and can take a Scald, though they hate risking a burn from Scald.

With Pressure, Calm Mind, and its superb bulk, Suicune is able to stall out threatening walls such as Amoonguss, Chansey, and even Assault Vest Tangrowth if it gets burned by Scald, allowing it to take many unsuspecting teams by surprise if it gets a few free turns. However, Suicune is held back by the prevalence of Grass- and Electric-types that can limit it from boosting like Tangrowth, Thundurus-T, and Zarude, the latter of which can cure Scald burns with Jungle Healing and use Power Whip to break past it. Powerful wallbreakers like Keldeo and Choice Specs Hydreigon are able to force Suicune into using Rest before it sets up, limiting its offensive presence and exploiting its somewhat limited defensive value as a Water-type. Rest is also unreliable recovery, forcing Suicune to rely on Leftovers alongside Rest in order to regain HP. This makes Suicune susceptible to Knock Off, as losing Leftovers would require Suicune to use Rest more often, limiting its ability to face threats like Scizor. In addition, its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't great either, as you rely on RNG to choose the ideal move. Suicune faces competition from Calm Mind Primarina, which sports an additional Fairy-typing to better threaten foes with neutral damage, but Suicune's ability to potentially turn Assault Vest Tangrowth into setup fodder is an important niche.</p>",

Cobalion is an excellent teammate for Suicune, countering Zarude and breaking past Chansey and Slowking. Cobalion also absorbs Knock Off from Scizor and Nihilego, offensively checks Thundurus-T, and can potentially set Stealth Rock to wear down Chansey and Tangrowth. Nihilego also sets Stealth Rock and can remove Chansey's Eviolite with Knock Off. Salamence can check threats like Keldeo and Zarude and provide Defog support for Suicune to keep entry hazards like Spikes from wearing it down. Suicune appreciates Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and Hippowdon to take on Electric-types like Thundurus-T and Raikou. Fast threats like Crobat and Choice Scarf Diggersby can offensively pressure threats to Suicune like Keldeo, Tapu Bulu, Zarude, and Choice Specs Hydreigon. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, and Assault Vest Tangrowth check dangerous foes like Keldeo and Zarude, with the latter two being solid Thundurus-T answers as well. Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain support also gives Suicune additional passive recovery, allowing it to not be forced into Rest as much. Umbreon provides Wish Support to keep Suicune healthy and takes on wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Mamoswine.

    "overview": "<p>An excellent typing, a plethora of utility moves such as Toxic, Yawn, and Stealth Rock, and good matchups against the tier's entry hazard removers like Excadrill, Tentacruel, and Salamence make Swampert a solid hazard setter. Good matchups against notable threats like Rotom-W, Cobalion, and Raikou contribute to Swampert's great defensive utility. Flip Turn also lets it be a slow pivot, limiting its passivity, making progress against walls such as Chansey, and bringing in slower teammates like Thundurus-T to wallbreak. However, the plethora of Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Zarude is incredibly hindersome to Swampert, scaring it out with 4x super effective attacks. Moreover, powerful wallbreakers like Hydreigon, Keldeo, and Primarina take advantage of its lack of reliable recovery to break through it. Swampert is very vulnerable to status and Knock Off, especially from Pokemon it should check like Excadrill and Nihilego, which make it much less effective as a tank. Swampert also faces severe competition from Hippowdon as a Ground-type Stealth Rock setter, which possesses reliable recovery to let it consistently check Zygarde-10% and Cobalion throughout a game. However, Swampert's access to Flip Turn and ability to blank Rotom-W gives it a solid niche over Hippowdon on more offensive VoltTurn teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set with Liquidation, Earthquake, Ice Punch, and Flip Turn takes advantage of Swampert's solid Attack while also dealing with the Dragon- and Grass-types of the tier more effectively. Scald can potentially burn foes like Skarmory and Scizor that Swampert otherwise struggles against, but it is hard to slot into Swampert's moveset over its other utility moves. High Horsepower is a good alternative to Earthquake if Swampert is being run alongside Tapu Bulu, since Grassy Surge weakens Earthquake, but is an inferior pick otherwise. Rest allows Swampert to offset its lack of recovery, but Swampert misses out on a utility move like Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Zarude, Tangrowth, and Tapu Bulu can easily scare Swampert out with their 4x super effective STAB moves, though the latter two do not like the potential of being inflicted by Toxic. Swampert similarly fears Grass-type coverage, leaving it unable to deal with Gyarados's Power Whip and properly check Thundurus-T and Nihilego until it scouts for Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Pokemon like Excadrill and Rotom-H that struggle to deal with Swampert otherwise can use Toxic to cripple it, drastically worsening its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Thanks to Swampert's lack of reliable recovery, Pokemon like Choice Specs Hydreigon, Choice Specs Primarina, and Keldeo can overwhelm it and take it out easily.</p>",

Yawn instead can shut down offensive powerhouses like Primarina that may threaten Swampert's teammates and force switches, allowing Swampert to generate even more momentum. Ice Beam lets Swampert threaten Dragon- and Grass-types like Salamence, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth.

    "overview": "<p>Torkoal is the primary sun setter in UU, using its great physical bulk to switch into Pokemon like Scizor and Zarude and set up sun while also providing role compression as a Stealth Rock setter and entry hazard remover. Torkoal serves as a great partner for sun wallbreakers like Venusaur, Darmanitan, and Chandelure by providing utility with moves such as the previously mentioned Stealth Rock alongside Yawn, Toxic, and Rapid Spin. However, Torkoal struggles with longevity, as it needs to use Heat Rock over Heavy-Duty Boots to provide more sun turns for its teammates, meaning every time it comes in it risks taking significant chip from entry hazards like Stealth Rock. It also has a lack of recovery, making it vulnerable to common enemy leads like Excadrill and Krookodile. Torkoal is also a momentum sink, meaning that the player will have to either switch directly into their sun sweepers like Venusaur and Darmanitan, potentially forcing them to take damage, or sacrifice Torkoal to bring them in safely. Torkoal is quite passive, often requiring status to stop Pokemon like Gyarados from setting up on it. It is also weak to common Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Nihilego, and Nidoqueen, meaning Torkoal appreciates defensive support from other Pokemon like Chansey to help it set sun more reliably throughout the game. Lastly, the presence of Hippowdon and its ability to set sand means Torkoal struggles to reliably keep up sun.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thanks to its low Speed, Torkoal can also be run on Trick Room teams, utilizing a powerful sun-boosted Eruption. However, Torkoal is weak to chip and entry hazard damage caused by switching in too many times if it is running Choice Specs over Heavy-Duty Boots, weakening Eruption as a result. Lastly, when Trick Room is over, Torkoal can be easily used as setup fodder or KOed by an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Nihilego, Rhyperior, and Lycanroc-D can all hit Torkoal for super effective damage, with the latter two not caring about its sky-high Defense, limiting the ability to set sun in the future due to Torkoal's lack of momentum or reliable recovery. The former two can also set up Stealth Rock, limiting the amount of times Torkoal can come in.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Krookodile, Nidoqueen, and Diggersby also can hit Torkoal for super effective damage, limiting Torkoal's ability to set sun in the future. The former two are also able to set up Stealth Rock against Torkoal, limiting the amount of times it can come in. Krookodile can also hinder Torkoal with Taunt, preventing it from punishing setup sweepers with Toxic or Yawn. Hippowdon is Torkoal's biggest enemy, being able to reset sun with its Sand Stream and easily set Stealth Rock in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Primarina, Keldeo, and Azumarill all can threaten Torkoal with their powerful Water-type attacks. However, if the sun is up, the power of these moves will be halved, and Torkoal will be able to switch out into Venusaur, forcing them out in return.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Torkoal's average Special Defense, strong special attackers like Moltres, Hydreigon, and Salamence all can nail Torkoal for heavy damage.

Lava Plume limits Torkoal's passivity thanks to its Base Power boosted by the sun and 30% chance to burn the foe. Rapid Spin prevents Pokemon like Darmanitan from being heavily chunked by Stealth Rock. Toxic puts Pokemon like Rotom-H, Swampert, and Hydreigon on a timer, forcing them out. Yawn allows Torkoal to force opposing Pokemon out such as setup sweepers like Gyarados that can attempt to set up on it while also giving a free switch for a teammate, but Toxic is preferred for its ability to inflict more damage throughout the game. Rest + Sleep Talk can be used to boost Torkoal's longevity, especially when paired with Stealth Rock setters like Swampert to free up the moveslot. Heat Rock should always be run to maximize the amount of sun turns, allowing sun sweepers like Venusaur and Darmanitan to break through opposing teams more easily.</p> <p>Powerful sun sweepers like Venusaur, Darmanitan, and Chandelure all act as great partners to Torkoal, as they appreciate its entry hazard support and removal as well as sun boosting their moves to clean through teams. Venusaur in particular is a fantastic partner for Torkoal, as sun activates Chlorophyll and turns its Weather Ball into a strong Fire-type attack for Steel-types like Scizor, Jirachi, and Celesteela. Venusaur also appreciates Torkoal's ability to put answers to it like Moltres and Chandelure on a timer with Toxic. In return, Torkoal appreciates Venusaur breaking through Rock-types like Lycanroc-D, Ground-types like Hippowdon, and Water-types like Primarina and Slowking. Meanwhile, Darmanitan can use the sun to boost its incredibly powerful Flare Blitz and revenge kill threats like Nihilego and Nidoking that threaten Torkoal. It can also bring in Torkoal safely with U-turn. Chansey can provide a defensive stop to Pokemon that threaten Torkoal such as Nihilego and Chandelure while also being able to provide momentum with Teleport to bring in Pokemon like Venusaur and Chandelure safely. Swampert also acts as a defensive stop to threats like Salamence and Nidoqueen and frees up Stealth Rock for Torkoal. Hatterene can act as a secondary entry hazard control option, alleviating the pressure from Torkoal while also dealing with Pokemon like Salamence. It also appreciates its Mystical Fire being boosted by the sun, allowing it to break through Pokemon like Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth more easily. Skarmory and Celesteela provide intergral defensive support against Hippowdon for sun teams.

However, Crawdaunt is extremely slow, being outsped and KOed by common threats such as Cobalion and Keldeo. This, combined with its poor bulk and weaknesses to common typings, leaves it with limited opportunities to switch in and forces Crawdaunt to rely on pivots to facilitate its wallbreaking attempts.Crawdaunt faces competition as a Water-type wallbreaker from Keldeo, Primarina, and Azumarill, all of which sport superior defensive utility.

Lash Out is an option to crush defensive Salamence attempting to switch into Crabhammer while being a solid alternative STAB to Knock Off.</p> <p>Crawdaunt is intended to be used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker on more offensive teams, tearing open defensive cores to allow its teammates to clean late-game. Pivots are essential to give Crawdaunt as many wallbreaking attempts as possible. Slowking is not only one of Crawdaunt's favorite targets, but an amazing teammate as well, defensively checking Keldeo and Noivern while also giving Crawdaunt safe entry with Teleport. Slowking also can provide Future Sight support to help Crawdaunt KO Pokemon like Salamence and Amoonguss that attempt to switch into it. Noivern, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Choice Scarf Diggersby can revenge kill faster threats like Cobalion, Zarude, and Raikou for Crawdaunt as well as bring it in against Hippowdon with U-turn. Scizor can bring in Crawdaunt with U-turn against threats like Celesteela as well as wear down Tangrowth and Salamence with Knock Off. It also answers Zarude. Entry hazard support is essential in wearing down bulky Pokemon due to Crawdaunt's inability to take a hit if it fails to KO its target.

Salamence can utilize its solid Special Attack, decent Speed tier, and powerful moves like Hurricane and Draco Meteor as a strong special attacker, or it can sweep teams with Dragon Dance and Moxie. That, coupled with coverage in Flamethrower and Earthquake, makes Salamence difficult to predict and revenge kill. However, its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots means Salamence does not appreciate Knock Off from Pokemon it’s supposed to check, such as Tangrowth and Scizor. Bulky Fairy-types like Hatterene and Primarina can easily take a hit and KO Salamence, while many other threats like Keldeo, Gyarados, and Nidoking carry Ice-type coverage. Offensive threats such as Thundurus-T and Nihilego outspeed it, and Dragon Dance sets are also vulnerable to revenge killers with priority such as Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D. Salamence also faces fierce competition from Hydreigon; Hydreigon's higher Special Attack stat alongside Dark-type STAB moves lets it better deal with popular defensive stalwarts such as Slowking, and it has greater item versatility by virtue of its neutrality to Stealth Rock. However, Salamence has a far better matchup against Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Scizor, and it's able to outspeed and revenge kill opposing Hydreigon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Intimidate Dragon Dance set using Roost over Outrage can work on Magneton teams to check problematic answers to Excadrill such as Zarude while remaining offensively potent, but this set fails to get past Hippowdon. Fire Blast over Flamethrower on the special attacking set gives Salamence more power against Steel-types like Celesteela; however, it is less reliable and the additional power is often unneeded. Lum Berry can give Salamence more room to set up on Pokemon like Swampert and Tangrowth, but it doesn't carry as much consistent utility as Life Orb. Choice Scarf alongside Moxie can give Salamence surprising sweeping potential, as it doesn't require a setup turn to outspeed targets such as Keldeo and revenge kills sweepers such as Gyarados. Choice Specs improves Salamence's wallbreaking ability and can lure Hippowdon in to nail it with Hydro Pump.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Azumarill, Togekiss, Primarina, and Hatterene take advantage of Salamence's lack of coverage for them, having the bulk to take a hit and either set up or KO Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Without Draco Meteor, special Salamence struggles to relieve Stealth Rock pressure from Nihilego, though it must be wary of Earthquake. Lycanroc-D can OHKO offensive variants of Salamence with -1 Stone Edge after minimal chip damage and easily revenge kill it with Accelerock, though Lycanroc-D cannot switch into Salamence safely.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Chansey and Slowking can handle special Salamence with their massive special bulk and use it for momentum with Teleport. However, the two cannot reliably tank hits from Dragon Dance sets. Umbreon and Mandibuzz have the natural bulk to survive Salamence's special attacks and take advantage of Dragon Dance sets with Foul Play. Celesteela is an especially detrimental defensive threat because it completely walls Dragon Dance sets without Fire Blast. Hippowdon can take hits from both physical and special sets and cripple Defog Salamence with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Mamoswine</strong>: Mamoswine is the most consistent revenge killer against Salamence, as Ice Shard OHKOes any set.</p>",

Defog can be used over either STAB move, though this sacrifices neutral coverage against Pokemon like Nihilego and Azumarill. Flamethrower is solid coverage against Pokemon such as Scizor and Skarmory and can finish off weakened targets such as Tangrowth and Conkeldurr without risking a Hurricane miss. Roost alongside Heavy-Duty Boots makes Salamence harder to wear down by threats like Scizor and Zarude. Intimidate makes Salamence a more reliable switch-in to threats such as Conkeldurr, Scizor, and Excadrill while making them easier to pivot around.</p> <p>This set fits on bulky offense and balance teams for its wallbreaking capabilities against Pokemon like Amoonguss and important defensive utility against other foes like Scizor. Swampert, Nidoqueen, and Excadrill are able to break through Salamence's checks like Nihilego, provide Stealth Rock support to soften up defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, and capitalize on support against Tangrowth. Excadrill also pressures Hatterene and Togekiss and provides Rapid Spin support so Salamence can drop Defog. Scizor and Mamoswine takes advantage of Salamence removing potential roadblocks such as Amoonguss and Skarmory, and they threaten Stealth Rock setters Salamence has troubles against like Chansey and Nihilego. Zarude, Slowking, and Cobalion are effective pivots to safely bring Salamence into foes such as Hydreigon and Tangrowth. Slowking in particular provides slow pivoting with Teleport so Salamence can safely enter on Grass-types, as well as providing a stronger backbone against Conkeldurr with Colbur Berry. Rotom-W also acts as a pivot to bring Salamence in on Tangrowth and can check Mamoswine and Celesteela. Azelf can handle faster Pokemon such as Nihilego and Lycanroc-D.

Fire Blast can be used instead to lure in and break through Skarmory and increase Salamence's chances for a Moxie sweep. Life Orb can be used to OHKO Pokemon such as bulky Moltres with +1 Outrage and Primarina with +2 Dual Wingbeat. It can also be used alongside a Naive nature to ensure that Fire Blast OHKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock. However, Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness and Life Orb recoil will quickly put it into range for Lycanroc-D's Accelerock. Moxie helps Salamence get multiple boosts to KO bulky targets like Hippowdon and makes it more difficult to revenge kill.</p> <p>This set fits on offense and hyper offense teams as a wallbreaker or late-game cleaner with Moxie. Excadrill is an excellent lead that sets Stealth Rock to wear down bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-W and provides Rapid Spin. Sticky Web from Ribombee lets Salamence outspeed foes such as Nihilego. Celesteela walls this set, so early-game wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Thundurus-T and Azelf are decent options. They also appreciate Salamence's ability to threaten Chansey. Other teammates that overwhelm physically bulky Pokemon such as Quagsire and Skarmory, such as Gyarados and Autotomize Celesteela, are valuable assets to this set. They also heavily benefit Salamence by overwhelming checks like Amoonguss and Primarina. Pivots such as Diggersby and Zarude can position Salamence to set up on Pokemon like Tangrowth. Zarude also blanks Hippowdon and Rotom-W for Salamence. Mamoswine is a consistent revenge killer against Salamence, so teammates that take it on such as Slowking and Scizor are appreciated.

Flamethrower nails Steel-types like Excadrill and Scizor, though Earthquake can be used to KO Nihilego while retaining coverage for the former. Intimidate alongside the additional HP investment makes Salamence a more sturdy switch-in to Conkeldurr, Zarude, and Scizor. Maximum Speed investment is needed to make Salamence less passive against offensive threats such as Hydreigon and Krookodile.</p> <p>This set is suited for balance and stall teams to relieve entry hazard pressure from setters like Excadrill and Skarmory and check dangerous Pokemon like Scizor and Zarude.

Umbreon can check Pokemon Salamence can't handle by itself like Mamoswine and Gyarados, and it heavily appreciates Salamence’s support against Fighting-types like Keldeo. Quagsire keeps Salamence from being overwhelmed by opposing Dragon Dance Salamence and Lycanroc-D and benefits from Salamence checking Grass-types. Knock Off support from teammates such as Nihilego is very beneficial so that Salamence can outlast threats such as Swampert. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth are useful switch-ins into special attackers such as Primarina and Thundurus-T.

  "Registeel": {
    "overview": "<p>Registeel serves the purpose of a bulky ChestoRest + Double Dance sweeper, as its bulk, combined with its amazing Steel typing, gives it the edge in a multitude of matchups. It is able to set up on common UU staples such as Nihilego, Chansey, and Scizor and bait offensive threats that hit it super effectively, such as Zygarde-10%, Conkeldurr, and pivot Thundurus-T, using them as setup fodder to start a sweep. Because of its ability to boost its physical and special bulk, Registeel has multiple opportunities to set up and can potentially steamroll teams lacking a Ghost-type, Taunt, or certain sweepers that don't take much from Body Press. It also has a good amount of PP on Iron Defense, Amnesia, and Rest combined, so it is able to stall out defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Amoonguss. Registeel is also a solid defensive Stealth Rock setter for many teams, checking various offensive threats, including Nihilego, Zarude, and Starmie. It also has access to status in Thunder Wave and Toxic, which makes it less passive against offensive teams. However, while Registeel's defensive profile is phenomenal, its passivity leads to inviting common wallbreakers and setup sweepers in, like Keldeo and Nidoking. It also faces stiff competition as a Steel-type Stealth Rock setter from the likes of Excadrill and Cobalion, both of which have an actual offensive presence. Registeel faces competition as a defensive Steel-type from Skarmory and Scizor; both have reliable recovery and Skarmory can check Pokemon like Gyarados and Diggersby. Registeel also greatly fears Knock Off because of how reliant it is on its item to stay healthy throughout a game. It's also often forced to use Rest between boosting, which gives wallbreakers like Keldeo and Nidoking chances to fish for critical hits to KO it through its boosts.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy Slam is an option on Stealth Rock sets over Seismic Toss to better deal with Hatterene and Togekiss, but you sacrifice consistent damage on other targets like Scizor and Zarude.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers like Nidoking, Chandelure, and Mamoswine can keep Registeel from setting up freely due to their attacks forcing it to use Rest. However, they can struggle to take on Registeel if it accumulates enough boosts. Chandelure, in particular, is troublesome due to its immunity to Body Press; it almost effortlessly beats Double Dance Registeel.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Trick</strong>: Taunt users such as Crobat annoy both Registeel. Trick users are extremely problematic as well, namely Choice Scarf Jirachi and Rotom-W, as they cripple Registeel and make it virtually useless.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type coverage</strong>: Fighting-types like Keldeo and Conkeldurr can immediately threaten Registeel with big damage and force it to use Rest, leaving it exploitable. Common users of Fighting-type coverage such as Iron Defense Skarmory, Nasty Plot Thundurus-T, and Swords Dance Scizor also immediately threaten Registeel. However, all of these Pokemon must come in before Registeel boosts the correct stat, or else they lose to it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-Resistant Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers resistant to Body Press, including Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro, Calm Mind Hatterene, Nasty Plot + Flamethrower Togekiss, and Swords Dance Tapu Bulu, force Registeel out before it is able to start sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Quagsire</strong>: Quagsire staves off Body Press with no issue due to its Unaware allowing it to ignore Registeel's boosts. It can come in freely and use Haze, putting a stop to any sort of sweep.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Maximum Defense investment with a Bold nature is needed to fully strengthen Body Press and increase its damage output, allowing Registeel to more freely set up on Azumarill, Zygarde-10%, and Excadrill. Iron Defense, in particular, makes Body Press's power skyrocket to exceptional levels. At +6, Registeel becomes incredibly powerful and is able to 2HKO even physically defensive Slowking with a favorable damage roll or minor chip damage. With Amnesia and Iron Defense, it is able to set up on multiple Pokemon, including Hippowdon, Salamence, and Tangrowth. This gives Registeel room to boost its unboosted stat as well. After a single Iron Defense, for example, Conkeldurr cannot 2HKO Registeel. Amnesia leaves Pokemon that would otherwise counter Registeel such as Moltres and Nidoking unable to 2HKO it, forcing them to fish for a critical hit in order to KO. Rest, along with Chesto Berry, allows Registeel to rid itself of status that would otherwise get in the way of a sweep. Rest also gives Registeel longevity to last throughout a game and stay healthy versus the likes of Excadrill, Scizor, and Cobalion.</p> <p>Registeel fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that provide it many opportunities to boost and sweep. Ghost-types are a massive problem for Registeel, as they are immune to Body Press and are usually able to power through it, so Hydreigon is a valuable teammate that can shut them down. Salamence and Slowking can check offensive Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Conkeldurr for Registeel. Registeel appreciates Knock Off absorbers like Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, and Rocky Helmet Tangrowth to ensure safer setup. Tapu Bulu also provides Grassy Terrain support to give it passive recovery and weaken Earthquake from Mamoswine and Diggersby. Nihilego is a solid partner for Registeel, as it removes common Fighting-resistant Pokemon such as Hatterene and Togekiss, and provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support that can aid in wearing down the opposition. It is also a reliable counter to Chandelure. Rotom-W threatens offensive Ground-types like Nidoking and Mamoswine, as well as Skarmory for Registeel. It can also provide valuable Defog support to clear the field of entry hazards. Calm Mind Hatterene is a good partner, due to countering Skarmory, which can KO Registeel after boosting alongside it with its own Body Press. It also prevents Skarmory from laying Spikes that would wear down Registeel a lot faster. Chansey can handle special attackers like Nidoking for Registeel while also providing Aromatherapy support to wake it up after Rest.</p>"

Toxic cripples switch-ins, including Slowking and Hippowdon, and puts a timer on common Defog users like Salamence and Mandibuzz. Thunder Wave is also an option that cripples faster offensive threats including Azelf, Keldeo, and Gyarados. Earthquake allows Registeel to threaten various Toxic-immune Pokemon, including Nidoqueen and Galarian Slowbro. Most importantly, it OHKOes Nihilego. Maximum Special Defense with a Careful nature allows Registeel to better check Salamence and Meteor Beam Nihilego.</p> <p>Registeel fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate the solid defensive utility it provides. Checks to Fire- and Fighting-type like Salamence and Slowking pair well with Registeel, taking on threats like Keldeo and Moltres. Thundurus-T and Rotom-W threaten common entry hazard removers, such as Salamence and Mandibuzz. Tentacruel, Mandibuzz, and the aforementioned Salamence can also remove Spikes, which cut into Registeel's longevity.

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's wide movepool, great utility options like Healing Wish, and amazing ability in Serene Grace make it a versatile force in UU. Serene Grace gives Iron Head a high chance to flinch slower foes like Hydreigon, making Choice Scarf Jirachi difficult to deal with for unprepared offensive teams. Additionally, Jirachi's above average bulk and great defensive typing allow it to check threats like Nihilego and Hatterene. Jirachi can fulfill a wide variety of roles on teams, whether it's revenge killing threats like Azelf with Choice Scarf, serving as a potent progress maker with its SubToxic set that can get through typical checks such as Amoonguss and Hippowdon, or healing its team with Wish. However, Jirachi's reliance on Leftovers for checking Pokemon like Salamence and Hatterene makes it susceptible to Knock Off from Nihilego and Tangrowth. Jirachi has only average offensive stats, making it very reliant on Iron Head flinches to make progress against foes it lacks coverage for, with common defensive staples like Skarmory, Excadrill, and Amoonguss walling it regardless. Jirachi, while jack of all trades, is master of none, and faces competition from Pokemon like Hydreigon as a revenge killer, Cobalion as a Steel-type Stealth Rock setter, and Umbreon as a Wish user, making its roles more specific.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jirachi can utilize a Stealth Rock set to support its team thanks to the switches it forces against foes like Nihilego. It can also run Healing Wish on this set to give sweepers like Calm Mind Keldeo another shot in the game. However, this set is quite passive and invites many threatening foes like Cobalion, Scizor, and Hippowdon in for free. Hippowdon, Nihilego, and Cobalion are often preferred as Stealth Rock setters instead due to their better matchups against common removers as well as the broader metagame. Jirachi can utilize a special attacker set with Meteor Beam to lure in and remove common switch-ins like Moltres and Rotom-H. However, this set struggles to cover everything. Jirachi can use Calm Mind sets to sweep on hyper offense teams, but these also struggle to choose their coverage. Jirachi can utilize a mixed set, which can notably KO Amoonguss with Psychic while nailing Hatterene with Iron Head, but it lacks in power compared to other offensive Psychic-types like Azelf. Jirachi can run Stored Power sets with Calm Mind and Weakness Policy to accumulate many boosts and sweep, but these sets struggle to get past Swords Dance Scizor and defensive Celesteela and can be ineffective without many boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure take very little from Jirachi's attacks and can force it out with their powerful STAB attacks. Jirachi especially dislikes a burn from Moltres's Flame Body. However, none of them like Jirachi using Trick to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Celesteela takes very little from Jirachi's attacks and can wear it down with Leech Seed + Flamethrower. Scizor walls Jirachi without Fire Punch and can use it as setup fodder or force it out. Excadrill also walls Jirachi and can devastate it with Earthquake. Cobalion and Skarmory can set entry hazards in front of Jirachi and chip it with Rocky Helmet recoil, though they dislike Trick.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W, Slowking, and Swampert take very little from Jirachi's attacks and can cripple it or decently damage it. However, they hate taking a Toxic from the SubToxic set. Offensive Water-types like Keldeo and Crawdaunt pressure Jirachi hard.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Zarude, Krookodile, and Hydreigon offensively threaten Jirachi and force it out. Zarude and Choice Scarf Hydreigon can revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Jirachi, with Choice Scarf Zarude outspeeding Choice Scarf variants as well. Mandibuzz and Umbreon don't mind Iron Head much and can wear it down with Foul Play. The latter also uses Inner Focus to block flinches and freely pass Wish to its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Pokemon carrying Knock Off like Tangrowth and Azelf can remove Leftovers to cripple defensive Jirachi, especially sets without Wish. Choice Scarf Jirachi becomes a much worse revenge killer without its item and can struggle to use Trick and Healing Wish effectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status</strong>: Due to Jirachi lacking reliable one-turn recovery, it is prone to getting worn down by entry hazards like Spikes as well as Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Jirachi also hates burns and paralysis from Pokemon like Moltres and Chansey, with paralysis making it hard to outspeed threats like Excadrill and leverage U-turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Jirachi is a potent revenge killer, outspeeding threats like Zygarde-10%, Azelf, and +1 Dragon Dance Gyarados. Iron Head can OHKO Pokemon like Nihilego and Lycanroc-D and, in conjunction with Serene Grace, possibly break through Pokemon like Hydreigon and Primarina with flinches. U-turn gets momentum against switch-ins like Skarmory and Excadrill as well as Pokemon it may not have coverage for like Gyarados and Thundurus-T. Trick lets Jirachi cripple Scizor and defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Slowking, but losing Choice Scarf compromises Jirachi's ability to revenge kill Pokemon like Azelf and Zarude, so it should be used wisely. Ice Punch is an option to nail Thundurus-T and Salamence, while Thunder Punch more reliably beats Gyarados and Azumarill. Fire punch does massive damage to Scizor, and Zen Headbutt lets Jirachi slam Amoonguss, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr. However, locking into coverage moves leaves Jirachi open to threats like Cobalion and Excadrill. Jirachi can utilize Healing Wish late-game to give a teammate another chance to sweep or defensively answer a threat.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi fits on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its revenge killing capabilities and Healing Wish. Zarude makes an excellent partner for it, completely blanking Slowking and Hippowdon, threatening Excadrill, and absorbing status and Knock Off. Amoonguss can also absorb Knock Off and can check faster threats like Choice Scarf Zarude. Wallbreakers like Thundurus-T, Conkeldurr, and Hydreigon can be brought in via U-turn on checks like Moltres, Excadrill, and Tangrowth. They all can benefit from Healing Wish too. Moltres forms a solid pivoting core with Jirachi, with each bringing the other in on their answers. Moltres also helps check Celesteela, Excadrill, Scizor, and Amoonguss, while Jirachi can revenge kill threats like Nihilego and Lycanroc-D. Moltres and Excadrill can provide entry hazard control to keep Jirachi from getting worn down. Entry hazard support from Nihilego and Hippowdon helps Jirachi wear down Pokemon like Primarina and Hatterene more easily. Nihilego and Hippowdon can also help check threats like Moltres and Salamence.</p>"

      "SubToxic": {
        "description": "<p>Jirachi can set up Substitute against Pokemon that are either unable or unlikely to break through it, such as Chansey and Slowking, and Pokemon that it can force out such as Hatterene and Nihilego. Substitute provides Jirachi with a safe opportunity to use Toxic against its checks like Hippowdon, Moltres, and Swampert, or a safety net to repeatedly use Iron Head against Pokemon like Tangrowth and Amoonguss without risk. Fire Punch offers coverage against Steel-types such as Scizor, Cobalion, and Skarmory while boasting a significant 20% burn chance via Serene Grace, which can be used to stack up damage alongside Iron Head flinches to better pressure Toxic-immune Pokemon like Skarmory and Amoonguss. On top of this, a burned Amoonguss is unable to break Jirachi's Substitute in a single hit, turning it into setup bait for later in the game. Toxic pairs fantastically with Substitute and Iron Head, letting Jirachi wear down and break through Pokemon it would otherwise struggle with such as Slowking and Mandibuzz, as well as crippling offensive checks such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Maximum HP investment provides Jirachi with 101 HP Substitutes, preventing Chansey's Seismic Toss from breaking them, while reducing the chance for Slowking to break them with Scald to a low 12.5%. This HP investment also prevents Rotom-W and Rotom-H from breaking Jirachi's Substitute with Volt Switch.</p> <p>SubToxic Jirachi fits best on balance teams that can defensively assist it against Pokemon like Scizor, Moltres, and Keldeo, which it can let in short-term, and provide other forms of support such as additional Toxic users and Heal Bell. Teammates that use Toxic reduce the number of setup turns Jirachi requires to break through checks such as Hippowdon. Celesteela and Skarmory are perfect candidates for this role, encouraging Pokemon like Hippowdon, Slowking, and Moltres to switch into them and be poisoned while providing key defensive support against Pokemon like Scizor, Zarude, and Excadrill. Skarmory can also provide Spikes support to further wear down switch-ins to Jirachi like Amoonguss and Excadrill. SubToxic Jirachi mandates partners such as Scizor and Krookodile that can remove Rocky Helmet from common users of it such as Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Scizor is also able to remove the items of other notable Jirachi checks, such as Celesteela and Hippowdon's Leftovers and Moltres's Heavy-Duty Boots, while Krookodile can provide Stealth Rock support. Hippowdon and Excadrill are also fantastic options for Stealth Rock setters that pair well with Jirachi, switching into Knock Off variants of Nihilego so Jirachi can maintain its Leftovers. Hippowdon can help check Cobalion, Excadrill, and Zygarde-10% for Jirachi, while Excadrill can provide Rapid Spin support and a safer initial switch into an potential unrevealed Grass Knot Nihilego. Slowking is also fantastic due to checking various Steel-types such as Celesteela, Cobalion, and Excadrill, which Jirachi struggles with, and various other offensive threats such as Moltres and Salamence. Offensive teammates such as Keldeo and Moltres greatly appreciate Jirachi's ability to overwhelm their shared checks such as Amoonguss and Slowking, and in return they can provide Jirachi with useful pivots into these Pokemon. SubToxic Jirachi also fits well on more defensive balance and semi-stall teams, greatly appreciating Wish support from Umbreon letting it use Substitute more freely, and Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Chansey and Articuno lets it more aggressively switch into Slowking and freely attack Moltres. Umbreon and Chansey can also help check threats to Jirachi such as Moltres and Noivern, while Articuno can keep the field clear of entry hazards from Jirachi's checks such as Skarmory and Hippowdon.</p>"

      "Wish + Protect": {
        "description": "<p>Wish keeps Jirachi healthy throughout a match, allowing it to check threats like Salamence and Hatterene more reliably. Jirachi can pass Wish to teammates that lack reliable recovery like Swampert. It distinguishes itself from Umbreon in this role thanks to U-turn, which makes passing Wishes easier. U-turn also allows Jirachi to pivot out against threats like Excadrill and Mandibuzz. Protect ensures Jirachi will receive its Wish and nets more Leftovers recovery. It also lets Jirachi scout Choice-locked threats like Zygarde-10% and Hydreigon. 240 Speed EVs let Jirachi outspeed Choice Specs Hydreigon, with the remaining EVs put in Special Defense and HP to better check Pokemon like Salamence and Nihilego.</p> <p>This set best fits on balance teams, which appreciate Jirachi healing the team with Wish while bringing teammates in safely with U-turn. Wallbreakers that get worn down easily like Mamoswine, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr greatly enjoy Wish, and U-turn can bring them in on targets like Celesteela and Excadrill. Hippowdon, Rhyperior, and Nihilego check threats like Moltres, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-H. The latter two enjoy Jirachi offsetting their lack of recovery with Wish support in return. They can also act as primary checks to Salamence and Noivern to lessen the load on Jirachi. Amoonguss can check Zarude and absorb Knock Off for Jirachi. Moltres also checks Zarude and can beat Steel-types like Scizor and Skarmory that Jirachi lures in. Zarude can bring Jirachi in safely to use Wish against Zarude's checks like Togekiss while also removing Slowking. Rotom-W forms a great defensive core with Jirachi, being able to check threats like Moltres, Autotomize Celesteela, and Starmie. It also enjoys having the freedom to run Defog or Will-O-Wisp over Pain Split. Tentacruel and Excadrill can clear Spikes, while Jirachi can offset their lack of recovery.</p>"

Its solid STAB moves in Leaf Storm and Sludge Bomb allow it to hit a plethora of staples such as Rhyperior, Primarina, and Tangrowth super effectively while also threatening others with Sludge Bomb poisons. Its typing lets Roserade check key Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Primarina, and Amoonguss. Roserade's Defense and Speed leave much to be desired, though, making it easy to revenge kill by many offensive Pokemon such as Krookodile, Lycanroc-D, and Salamence. It is also unable to touch Steel-types such as Celesteela, Jirachi, and Aegislash, barring Sleep Powder. Roserade faces competition with other Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth, which offer better defensive utility against threats like Keldeo, Azumarill, and Krookodile but lack Spikes and are passive, and offense threats like Zarude, Nihilego, and Nidoking, which are more threatening due to better coverage and Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more specially defensive spread can be used to better check foes such as Keldeo, Raikou, and Primarina. Life Orb makes Roserade a greater offensive threat and lets it OHKO threats such as Buzzwole and Necrozma with entry hazard support; this does, however, severely worsen its longevity. Leaf Storm is a powerful move it can run; however, the Special Attack drop makes it easier to take advantage of. Toxic Spikes aids wallbreakers such as Keldeo and Zygarde-10% in breaking down checks like Tangrowth, Primarina, and Buzzwole and generally annoys the opposing team, but Spikes is usually better due to the abundance of Poison-immune Pokemon and Poison-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Roserade cannot touch Aegislash, Celesteela, and Jirachi, aside from an inaccurate Sleep Powder, and gives them a free switch or opportunity to set up.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Entei, Rotom-H, and Moltres threaten to OHKO Roserade with powerful Fire-type moves and force it out; however, they do not appreciate switching in on Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Galarian Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Azelf are able to threaten Roserade with their STAB moves and force it out or set up on it.

Sleep Powder is preferred to cripple switch-ins such as Aegislash and Galarian Slowbro, although Synthesis can be used to better check threats such as Primarina, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth and more comfortably set Spikes on walls such as Chansey and Mantine. Black Sludge helps Roserade better check Primarina and Rotom-W while also allowing it to passively heal up residual damage. The EV spread allows it to survive two Secret Swords from Choice Specs Keldeo.</p> <p>Roserade's ability to set up Spikes makes it an excellent partner for powerful wallbreakers such as Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, Salamence, and Gyarados. Krookodile and Nihilego can form an entry hazard stacking core with Roserade, pairing up its Spikes with Stealth Rock. Krookodile also becomes able to switch into a slept Aegislash without getting punished by Toxic, while Nihilego is able to threaten Fire-types like Moltres and Rotom-H. They also remove items like Eviolite on Chansey and Leftovers on Aegislash with Knock Off, letting Roserade wear them down more easily. Due to its weakness to foes like Moltres and Mamoswine, Roserade appreciates Water-types such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Primarina; in return, Roserade resists Grass- and Electric-type moves for them.

    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon is an incredible mixed wall for balance teams due to its incredible typing and access to Recover. Its ability in Storm Drain gives it an important Water immunity that allows it to switch into threats such as Rotom-W and scout Keldeo with a Choice item, while Gastrodon's stellar typing lets it reliably switch into most Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon not running specific coverage for it such as Rotom-H, Thundurus-T, and Chandelure. It additionally serves as a consistent answer to Nidoking. Gastrodon, however, carries a quadruple weakness to Grass, leaving it taken advantage of by Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Zarude in particular is very problematic as Jungle Healing prevents it from being crippled by Toxic or a Scald burn. Gastrodon is also vulnerable to coverage from threats such as Nihilego with Grass Knot and Gyarados with Power Whip. Gastrodon is also rather passive due to its mediocre attacking stats, it relies heavily on status to make progress in games against bulkier teams, and struggles to stop setup sweepers such as Kommo-o and Gyarados. Gastrodon is also crippled by status, as it bleeds into its longevity, with Toxic specifically forcing it to leave the field often to avoid being taken out by chip.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gastrodon can utilize a Curse set to attempt to be on the more offensive end, but it's highly niche due to how hard it is to set up, as well as threats such as Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth being able to easily make work of it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss take advantage of Gastrodon's 4x weakness to make quick work of it, as it has little to no way to answer them offensively and it folds to their STAB attacks. Zarude counters Gastrodon as it can easily pivot into it and heal off status. Gastrodon also has to be careful of Grass-type coverage on Pokemon like Gyarados, Nihilego, and Azelf.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Breakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Mienshao, Diggersby, and Mamoswine can overpower Gastrodon with their powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Galarian Moltres, Gyarados, and Autotomize Necrozma can threaten to break through Gastrodon's defenses after setup but must be wary to not get hit by status in their attempt to set up.</p>",

Ice Beam pressures Salamence while catching Grass-types off guard, but due to Gastrodon's relatively weak attacking power, it is unable to 3HKO Amoonguss or Zarude. Dropping Scald also gives Gastrodon no way to punish Rotom-H. Toxic allows Gastrodon to passively chip bulkier targets such as Rotom-W and Salamence which otherwise don't care too much for Gastrodon's STAB attacks. Clear Smog is useful for stopping setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro, but it makes Gastrodon painfully passive. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Gastrodon to repeatedly switch in without being worn down by hazards, as they remove a large part of Gastrodon's functionality as a defensive Pokemon. Leftovers is an optional item to give Gastrodon passive recovery, but Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred due to how great ignoring hazard chip is. The spread allows Gastrodon to avoid being 3HKOed by Salamence's Hurricane and Nidoking's Earth Power while having enough defense investment to take on physical attackers such as Rhyperior and Barraskewda reliably. Gastrodon can also run a physically defensive spread, allowing it to better check Lycanroc-D, but powerful wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Diggersby can still overwhelm it easily.</p> <p>Gastrodon belongs on balance and bulky offense teams, where its defensive capabilities shine the most. Grass-types such as Amoonguss are incredible for covering Gastrodon's one weakness, while Gastrodon checks the Fire-types like Moltres that would otherwise threaten them. Both Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth can also take on problematic Pokemon like Keldeo and Primarina for Gastrodon, as their powerful attacks can overwhelm it quickly. Zarude in particular enjoys the presence of Gastrodon, as it can bring Gastrodon in on annoying checks to it like Moltres. In return, Zarude can revenge kill wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Diggersby that threaten Gastrodon. Buzzwole and Celesteela can stomach physical attacks for Gastrodon while being solid Grass-resistant Pokemon. Togekiss appreciates Gastrodon taking on Electric-types like Thundurus-T and can take on Grass-types like Zarude in return. It also can function as a cleric to remove status from Gastrodon that would otherwise hinder it. Fire-types such as Chandelure and Rotom-H appreciate Gastrodon's immunity to Water-type moves, as it can switch into those attacks for them. If Gastrodon chooses to run Leftovers, entry hazard removal from the aformentioned Rotom-H and Salamence can help keep Gastrodon from getting worn down by entry hazards.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon is an extremely potent mixed wall in UU thanks to its amazing bulk, solid typing, and reliable recovery. Its naturally high Defense allows it to invest in Special Defense to check Salamence and Thundurus-T while still answering physical attackers like Excadrill, Zygarde-10%, and Cobalion. Its bulk even lets it trade with threats that hit it super effectively like Tangrowth and Rotom-W and cripple them with Toxic. Hippowdon is a great Stealth Rock setter due to matching up well against common entry hazard removers like Salamence, Mandibuzz, Excadrill, and Tentacruel and easily setting Stealth Rock against Pokemon it walls like Excadrill, Cobalion, and Nihilego without Grass Knot. Utility options, like Toxic to cripple Tangrowth and Rotom-W and Whirlwind to keep setup sweepers like Scizor from setting up on it, limit Hippowdon's passivity. However, Hippowdon is still quite passive, relying on Toxic to cripple the common Grass- and Water-types that beat it; even then, threats like Zarude and RestTalk Primarina don't mind it. Certain setup sweepers like Bulky Swords Dance Scizor and Autotomize Celesteela can use Hippowdon as a free entry point, as well as setup fodder if it forgoes Whirlwind, which usually happens due to Toxic being very difficult to drop. Even Pokemon Hippowdon should check, like Nihilego, Thundurus-T, Rotom-H, and Moltres, can get around it by using coverage moves like Grass Knot or crippling it with Toxic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hippowdon can run a Curse set, but the presence of common Water- and Grass-types keeps this set from succeeding. Ice Fang can hit Salamence and Thundurus-T without Hippowdon relying on Toxic, while Fire Fang threatens Scizor. However, these moves fail to provide the utility Toxic provides. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used on teams without entry hazard removal to stop Spikes from wearing down Hippowdon, but it typically gets hit by Knock Off from switching into threats like Nihilego and Thundurus-T.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Zarude completely walls Hippowdon, ignoring Toxic thanks to Jungle Healing and threatening to KO it. Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu hate Toxic but can threaten Hippowdon with heavy damage. Grass-type coverage on Nihilego, Thundurus-T, and Azelf means Hippowdon must scout their movesets before switching in.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types like Keldeo, Azumarill, and Gyarados deal massive damage to Hippowdon with their attacks. Rotom-W, Slowking, and RestTalk Primarina can switch into Hippowdon well, though the former two hate Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Hippowdon gets worn down more easily if crippled by Toxic, with many common threats like Chansey and Swampert carrying this move. Even Pokemon Hippowdon is supposed to check like Moltres, Rotom-H, and Zygarde-10% can fit Toxic to cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Setup Sweepers</strong>: Sweepers like Autotomize Celesteela, Iron Defense Skarmory, and Swords Dance Scizor use Hippowdon as setup fodder unless it fits Whirlwind, exploiting its low damage output and their immunities to Toxic.</p>",

Hippowdon's naturally high Attack also prevents Amoonguss from switching in for free, especially with additional sand damage and Stealth Rock, wearing it down despite Regenerator. Toxic cripples switch-ins like Slowking, Rotom-W, and Tangrowth. It also makes Hippowdon less passive against wallbreakers like Thundurus-T and Hydreigon and lets it beat Defoggers like Salamence and Rotom-W. Whirlwind is an option to phaze setup sweepers like Swords Dance Scizor and Autotomize Celesteela, but Toxic crippling so many answers to Hippowdon makes it too good to pass up most of the time. However, Whirlwind and Toxic can be run together if Hippowdon is used alongside another Stealth Rock setter like Nihilego. Slack Off gives Hippowdon reliable recovery to consistently handle threats like Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Zygarde-10%. Sand Stream helps chip down threats like Chansey and Thundurus-T, though Sand Force can be used if sand damage is detrimental to Hippowdon's team. Leftovers gives Hippowdon passive recovery and lets it spend fewer turns using Slack Off, while Rocky Helmet chips down threats like Cobalion, Scizor, and Diggersby. Rocky Helmet also lets Hippowdon counter lead Excadrill by preventing it from using Rapid Spin, allowing itself to set Stealth Rock. The given EV spread alongside an Impish nature lets Hippowdon OHKO Excadrill with Earthquake, avoid the 2HKO from Zygarde-10%'s Outrage if it has Leftovers, and better check special attackers like Salamence and Thundurus-T. If running Rocky Helmet, 112 Defense EVs are needed to avoid the 2HKO from Outrage.</p> <p>Hippowdon best fits on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams that appreciate a reliable Stealth Rock setter that is also a sustainable wall. Skarmory forms a great entry hazard-stacking core with Hippowdon, providing Spikes to complement its Stealth Rock while also beating Zarude, Mamoswine, and Scizor; in return, it appreciates Hippowdon beating Defoggers it loses to like Salamence. Nihilego makes a solid partner due to it beating Autotomize Celesteela and serving as a potent Stealth Rock setter, allowing Hippowdon to run both Toxic and Whirlwind. Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss check Water-types like Keldeo, Primarina, and Azumarill for Hippowdon, with the latter also handling opposing Tangrowth. Zarude can counter Rotom-W and Slowking and switch into a predicted Grass Knot from Thundurus-T. Entry hazard removers like Mandibuzz and Tentacruel remove Spikes, which wear down Hippowdon. Mandibuzz also acts as a secondary check to Zygarde-10% and can discourage Swords Dance Scizor from boosting with the threat of Foul Play. Moltres and Salamence like Hippowdon's entry hazards and sand chip damage wearing down Slowking, and they remove Scizor, Skarmory, and Zarude for it in return. On stall teams, Umbreon can be used to increase Hippowdon's longevity with Wish and answer Mamoswine and Gyarados, while Articuno can remove status with Heal Bell.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior stands out as an Electric-immune Pokemon and Stealth Rock user, as it is one of the few defensive Ground-types available, while also having the benefit of being a Flying-type resist. It has a stronger offensive presence than Swampert and more defensive utility than Nidoqueen and Krookodile with its typing that allows it to switch into Rotom-H, Crobat, Togekiss, and Salamence. Its unique Solid Rock ability also allows it to blanket check a good portion of the metagame, stomaching strong super effective hits like Bullet Punch from Scizor and Earthquake from Diggersby. Its STAB moves have reliable coverage for a majority of the metagame, covering Pokemon like Thundurus-T, Crobat, and Galarian Slowbro hard and threatening common entry hazard removers such as Salamence and Rotom-H. However, it remains vulnerable to common Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types such as Zarude, Primarina, and Keldeo, which threaten to KO it with little to no chip. Regenerator users like Tangrowth, Slowking, and Amoonguss are annoying too, as they can take a majority of Rhyperior's attacks just to heal off with a switch or immediately pressure it with a STAB attack. Powerful wallbreakers like Nidoking, Mamoswine, Conkeldurr, and Hydreigon can muscle past Rhyperior easily, taking advantage of its reliance on Leftovers for recovery. Rhyperior faces severe competition from other Stealth Rock setters like Excadrill and Nihilego who provide better defensive utility because of their typings and check more relevant threats. Hippowdon in particular largely outclasses Hippowdon thanks to its access to Slack Off, allowing it to consistently check foes like Salamence, as well as offset Spikes damage. It only being 2x weak to Grass- and Water-types means it can afford to stay in against foes like Tangrowth and Rotom-W and cripple them with Toxic, something Rhyperior cannot do.</p>",

Megahorn can improve Rhyperior's matchup against Psychic-types like Reuniculus while OHKOing Zarude. High Horsepower can be used over Earthquake to avoid being weakened by Grassy Terrain but is only worth the decreased power and accuracy when Tapu Bulu is on the same team.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Primarina, Azumarill, and Rotom-W all have the bulk to switch into Rhyperior and can OHKO it with a STAB move.

Keldeo can threaten Rhyperior out with 4x super effective STAB moves and proceed to set up or use Flip Turn. Conkeldurr can stomach a hit and regain lost health with Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Amoonguss and Tangrowth can sponge anything Rhyperior throws at them and heal back with Regenerator or threaten it with a STAB move. Tapu Bulu weakens Rhyperior's Earthquake with its Grassy Terrain and can switch into its moves. Zarude can outspeed and OHKO Rhyperior with Power Whip. Rhyperior also has to be careful of Grass-type coverage from Pokemon like Nihilego, Thundurus-T, and Azelf as well.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Pokemon that Rhyperior frequently pivots against such as defensive Salamence and Rotom-H can wear it down with Toxic and make it hard to deal with them throughout the match.</p>",

  "Tangrowth": {
    "overview": "<p>Tangrowth's stellar ability in Regenerator, massive defense stat, good defensive typing, and solid offensive presence makes Tangrowth one of the best walls in the tier. Tangrowth typically operates with an Assault Vest set, becoming a mixed wall that can check threats like Primarina and Thundurus-T on the special end and Excadrill and Zygarde-10% on the physical end. Meanwhile, full investment in physical defense lets it check Zygarde-10%, Zarude, and Conkeldurr more reliably. Access to coverage moves like Knock Off, Focus Blast, and Sludge Bomb let Tangrowth severely cripple defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Cobalion, and Salamence, with physically defensive sets even utilizing Sleep Powder to shut down Scizor. However, Tangrowth is still incredibly vulnerable to types like Poison, Flying, and Fire, causing it to run from threats like Amoonguss, Crobat, and Salamence. Tangrowth faces competition from Amoonguss as a defensive Grass-type, as the latter's Poison typing lets it check threats like Primarina, Keldeo, and opposing Tangrowth more reliably; it can also put foes to sleep more reliably thanks to Spore. However, Tangrowth's huge Defense, generally lower passivity, and ability to cripple walls like Chansey with Knock Off are invaluable. Tangrowth hates being setup fodder for Pokemon like Scizor and Galarian Slowbro, which often force it to switch out against them, and its abysmal Special Defense means its physically defensive set struggles against special attackers like Primarina and Thundurus-T. Finally, Assault Vest Tangrowth is prone to Knock Off from Pokemon it would check, like Azelf, which defeats its role as a special wall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leech Seed is an option to wear down switch-ins like Scizor, but it is easily avoided by switching out and by pivoting from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Moltres. Other Pokemon like opposing Tangrowth, Hatterene, and Amoonguss are not affected by Leech Seed, making it hard to justify using over Giga Drain's immediate recovery. Stun Spore can be considered to slow down and cripple Pokemon like Nidoking, Salamence, and Tentacruel, but its accuracy is shaky and common Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Amoonguss are immune to it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Many of the tier's Steel-types can switch directly into Tangrowth. Skarmory completely blanks Tangrowth and can set Spikes against it for free. Celesteela forces physically defensive Tangrowth out with Flamethrower and cripples Assault Vest variants with Toxic, but hates taking Knock Off. Scizor can use both Tangrowth sets as setup bait, though it hates a possible Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Nidoqueen, Nihilego, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel can hit Tangrowth with their respective STAB moves, and Tentacruel can also damage Tangrowth with Liquid Ooze if it ever uses Giga Drain. Since they force Tangrowth out with offensive pressure, the former two can use it to set Stealth Rock. Amoonguss takes little from Tangrowth's moves and only dislikes Knock Off, forcing Tangrowth to switch out; this gives Amoonguss a free opportunity to put one of Tangrowth's teammate to sleep via Spore. Tentacruel can remove Tangrowth's Assault Vest with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Tangrowth is extremely pressured by Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure and is almost always forced out.

Leaf Storm is another option to deal massive damage to Hippowdon, which otherwise can afford to stay in on Power Whip and cripple Tangrowth with Toxic. Knock Off is extremely useful for crippling common Tangrowth answers like Salamence and Crobat. Sludge Bomb has a decent chance to poison foes like Salamence and is also Tangrowth's best way to hit Zarude and opposing Tangrowth. Focus Blast hits Hydreigon and Cobalion for heavy damage.

A full utility set with Heal Bell, Thunder Wave, and Roost trades Togekiss's offensive potential for a more defensive role as a cleric and speed control user. It can also choose to drop one of the two utility moves for Defog, but its bad matchup against most Stealth Rock users, such as Nihilego, makes the Defogger role better fulfilled by Togekiss's teammates, and it is better off being paired with better entry hazard removal options. Choice Specs is an option to let Togekiss lure in Pokemon such as Nihilego and Cobalion and KO them with Psyshock and Fire Blast, respectively, but it loses defensive utility without Roost, fails to break through defensive Pokemon such as Chansey without Air Slash flinches, and struggles with its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus-T, Raikou, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H resist Air Slash, are immune to Thunder Wave, and take little from Fire Blast, forcing Togekiss out and making its job much harder.

Other Ground-type wallbreakers like Excadrill and Zygarde-10% offer better defensive utility and greater Speed, respectively. Mamoswine is prone to wearing itself down between Life Orb recoil and entry hazards, limiting its ability to wallbreak throughout a game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band can be used for more power without the recoil created by Life Orb, but Mamoswine prefers to be able to switch up its moves. Heavy-Duty Boots is another viable option for Mamoswine's item that prevents it from being worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil while still retaining some wallbreaking power. Mamoswine can be used as a Stealth Rock setter but removing any of Mamoswine's four main moves severely limits its wallbreaking potential. Freeze-Dry is an option to OHKO Quagsire and nearly OHKO Swampert with Life Orb as well as better pressure Rotom-W. The utility offered by Knock Off is generally better, though, as it does nearly the same amount of damage as Freeze-Dry to Rotom-W, and Mamoswine can already nearly 2HKO Gastrodon and Quagsire with Earthquake. A Choice Scarf set allows Mamoswine to outspeed its typical fast checks like Zarude and Lycanroc-D, but this set faces a lot of competition from Diggersby, which also has access to U-turn to pivot out of unfavourable matchups.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Mamoswine struggles to break through Skarmory, as it can stomach multiple Icicle Crashes and recover any lost health with Roost while also forcing it out with Body Press. However, Skarmory does need to be careful of taking on Mamoswine if it has taken lots of chip, as a flinch from Icicle Crash can lead to it being KOd. Colbur Berry Slowking also is a strong answer to Mamoswine, being able to take Knock Off and Earthquake well and KO it back with Scald. Swampert and Umbreon can trade damage with Mamoswine, but they can get overwhelmed between having their Leftovers removed and switching in and taking entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-H and Rotom-W</strong>: Both Rotom-W and Rotom-H are immune to Earthquake and resist Ice, making it difficult for Mamoswine to break through them. Additionally, both of these Pokemon can typically force Mamoswine out with STAB attacks or status moves, though they need to be wary of Knock Off on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: UU has many threats like Cobalion, Gyarados, and Keldeo that are faster than Mamoswine and threaten to KO it with super effective attacks. Mamoswine is also weak to multiple priority attacks, allowing Scizor, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr to KO it after minimal chip.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Since Mamoswine typically needs Life Orb to be effective, it will get worn down quickly, especially if it has to switch into Stealth Rock or Spikes.</p>",

Ice Shard can threaten many faster threats like Thundurus-T and Zarude, and it can also OHKO offensive Salamence and Zygarde-10%. Knock Off is used to punish and cripple switch-ins like Rotom-H and Rotom-W, allowing Mamoswine or another teammate to break past them more easily later. Oblivious keeps Mamoswine from having its Attack lowered by Intimidate Salamence. Thick Fat in an option that offers better protection against Rotom-H and ensures it can take a Flamethrower from Moltres. Life Orb is preferred, as it allows Mamoswine to safely 2HKO almost anything in the tier, including Celesteela and Chansey. However, Never-Melt Ice also is an option to retain a powerful Icicle Crash while not wearing itself down with Life Orb, but this comes at the cost of a much weaker Earthquake, missing out on a 2HKO on Slowking, even after Stealth Rock. An Adamant Nature maximizes Mamoswine's wallbreaking potential.</p> <p>Mamoswine best functions on offensive teams that provide it many opportunities to wallbreak. Late-game cleaners like Azelf appreciate Mamoswine's early-game wallbreaking and can deal with faster threats like Cobalion and Keldeo as well as walls like Skarmory. Azelf also wears down Slowking, allowing Mamoswine to break through it easier. Pivots like Zarude, Rotom-W, and Slowking lure in Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss and then pivot to Mamoswine for a more favorable matchup; Slowking in particular provides slow pivoting with Teleport to get Mamoswine in safely. Mamoswine is vulnerable to priority moves from Conkeldurr, Scizor, and Azumarill; Amoonguss can switch into most of their attacks. Entry hazard support from Cobalion and Nihilego can wear down Pokemon like Skarmory and Umbreon for Mamoswine to break past them more easily. Counterplay against Scizor is essential to keep Mamoswine from being revenge killed by Bullet Punch; the aformentioned Cobalion and Rotom-H serve as solid checks to it. Similarly, entry hazard control from Excadrill and Tentacruel can remove opposing entry hazards that would wear Mamoswine down. Primarina helps overwhelm Celesteela and Slowking for Mamoswine and takes on Keldeo.</p>"

As an Electric-type pivot, it distinguishes itself from Rotom-W and Thundurus-T thanks to its ability to immediately threaten and wipe out common Grass-type walls like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Its typing also gives it the resistances to check Pokemon like Celesteela, Moltres, Scizor, Mamoswine. However, Rotom-H lacks reliable recovery, meaning it can get overwhelmed when trying to check multiple foes like Thundurus-T + Mamoswine. Pokemon it wants to switch into like Scizor and Tangrowth can remove its Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, and most entry hazard setters, including Swampert, Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Nihilego, can beat it, though Swampert and Hippowdon fear Toxic. It's also outsped and KOed by various common threats such as Keldeo, Hydreigon, and Zygarde-10%. Rotom-W gives Rotom-H massive competition due to its ability to immediately threaten Ground-types like Hippowdon and Nidoking, allowing it to have a nearly unblockable Volt Switch.</p>",

However, Rotom-H has an only average Speed tier and is subject to being overwhelmed by common Pokemon like Keldeo, Nihilego, and Hydreigon. Defog can be used against Pokemon Rotom-H forces out like Amoonguss, Jirachi, Celesteela, and Moltres, but Rotom-H loses to common Stealth Rock setters like Hippowdon and Nihilego. Furthermore, it must forego Pain Split, leaving it with limited longevity taking on Pokemon it should check like Scizor and Mamowswine. Choice Scarf + Trick cripples common Rotom-H answers like Chansey and Swampert and revenge kills +1 Gyarados. However, Trick sacrifices another valuable moveslot, and using Choice Scarf hampers Rotom-H's longevity by leaving it vulnerable to Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey walls Rotom-H with its enormous special bulk, wears it down with Toxic, and keeps itself healthy with Soft-Boiled, but it has to be wary of Pain Split due to the huge amount of HP Rotom-H receives.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Lycanroc-D and Nihilego outspeed and OHKO Rotom-H, the latter of which being a reliable switch-in. Rhyperior can take Overheat with relative ease and OHKO back with Stone Edge. Nihilego and Rhyperior can also set Stealth Rock in front of Rotom-H.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Swampert, Hippowdon, and Nidoqueen all block Volt Switch and can threaten Rotom-H with massive damage or status, although the former two hate Toxic while the latter doesn't like taking Overheat. Zygarde-10% and Excadrill are both notable for outspeeding and OHKOing Rotom-H by getting past Levitate, the former using Thousand Arrows and the latter utilizing Mold Breaker Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Keldeo, Starmie, and Tentacruel all outspeed and threaten Rotom-H. Rotom-W, Slowking, and Primarina take Volt Switch well and threaten Rotom-H back with super effective damage. Crawduant and Azumarill can pick off Rotom-H with priority Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Rotom-H hates Knock Off, as it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots and becomes susceptible to Stealth Rock. Pokemon Rotom-H normally would check like Mamoswine, Scizor, and Tangrowth can heavily hinder it, allowing them to overcome Rotom-H in the long-term as it takes additional damage from Stealth Rock.</p>",

Slowking is a slow pivot that can switch into offensive checks like Keldeo and Nihilego for Rotom-H. Additionally, Amoonguss, Tangrowth and Zarude make for great partners, destroying Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types like Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, Zygarde-10%, and Hippowdon that trouble Rotom-H.

Hydro Pump brilliantly complements Volt Switch, wiping out Ground-types like Hippowdon and Excadrill that attempt to block Volt Switch, giving it nearly unblockable momentum. Its utility moves can also greatly aid its team with certain roles; Will-O-Wisp can let it punish Amoonguss and Scizor, while Defog lets it remove entry hazards thanks to its strong matchup against common entry hazard setters like Skarmory and Hippowdon. Choice Scarf sets can also provide great role compression to a team, providing insurance against +1 Gyarados and +2 Celesteela and an entry hazard remover in one slot. However, Rotom-W's low HP and reliance on Leftovers and Pain Split for recovery limit its role as a pivot due to its susceptibility to Stealth Rock, leaving it vulnerable to Knock Off users like Scizor and Mamoswine.

It also faces competition from Primarina and Slowking, which can check Hydreigon, Azelf, and Cobalion, foes that Rotom-W cannot.

However, losing out on the passive recovery of Leftovers makes them hard to justify. Toxic can be used to punish Tangrowth further than Will-O-Wisp, but it is often not worth it over that or Defog, since it leaves Rotom-W unable to touch Amoonguss at all. A Nasty Plot set with Pain Split can exploit bulkier teams and annoy its checks with Discharge paralysis, but it can't hit Grass-types and is greatly outclassed by Thundurus-T as a Nasty Plot user due to the latter's much higher Speed, greater power, and better coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type coverage</strong>: Tangrowth and Amoonguss stonewall Rotom-W completely, but they don't appreciate Will-O-Wisp, and must be careful of Trick on Choice Scarf variants; however, they can give it a detrimental item like Assault Vest or Black Sludge.

    "overview": "<p>Azelf is a premier offensive threat in UU due to its elite Speed, high Special Attack, and large movepool. U-turn and Knock Off make it a great offensive pivot that cripples checks like Mandibuzz and Chansey, while coverage moves like Flamethrower, Energy Ball, and Dazzling Gleam allow it to threaten staples like Celesteela, Slowking, and Hydreigon. Meanwhile, Nasty Plot Azelf is a dangerous wallbreaker that threatens specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Celesteela, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. It's fast enough to outspeed and KO many other speedy Pokemon like Keldeo and Nihilego, only being naturally outsped by Noivern, Crobat, and the niche Salazzle. Though Azelf is powerful, its frailty means that it has to pivot out or make outright KOs if it wants to last long-term. Common Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Diggersby can KO or use U-turn against Azelf, and Azelf is quite vulnerable from priority attacks such as Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Scizor's Bullet Punch. Azelf's great coverage is limited by its moveslots, as a pivot set will have to often choose between Knock Off for support, Energy Ball to threaten Hippowdon, Swampert, and Primarina, and Dazzling Gleam to better handle Dark-types like Hydreigon and Mandibuzz. Nasty Plot faces a similar conundrum, often choosing between Energy Ball and Dazzling Gleam. Thundurus-T gives Azelf stiff competition as both an offensive pivot and a Nasty Plot sweeper. While Azelf is faster and is better equipped to handle threats like Nihilego, Thundurus-T has a better defensive typing, higher Special Attack, and Electric-type STAB moves for threatening common defensive Pokemon that Azelf struggles to beat like Mandibuzz and Slowking.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs gives Azelf immense power behind its attacks, threatening to OHKO Assault Vest Tangrowth after Stealth Rock as well as deal more damage to bulky foes like Primarina. A Choice Band set takes advantage of Azelf's high Attack stat to act as an incredibly strong pivot with U-turn, Knock Off, and solid options in Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, Explosion, and Trick. While this can be effective on some teams, other Choice Band users like Zygarde-10% and Crawduant offer more spammable high-power attacks in Thousand Arrows and STAB Knock Off. Choice Scarf can be used to surprise other Choice Scarf users like Zarude and Hydreigon, as well as faster threats like Crobat. However, this set is very situational and will oftentimes not have much utility compared to other Choice Scarf users like Jirachi, which can spam Iron Head and use Healing Wish in addition to pivoting. Azelf is also naturally fast and doesn't need Choice Scarf to outspeed most unboosted foes. Azelf can act as a Stealth Rock setter, but it should only be used if the team has no other viable options. While Azelf also gets Taunt to prevent Defog, the prevalence of Pokemon like Excadrill that can both spin on Azelf, threaten it with Earthquake thanks to Mold Breaker, and also set up Stealth Rock itself, makes Stealth Rock Azelf less optimal. A Pokemon like Cobalion, Nihilego, or the aforementioned Excadrill is generally a better option for setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Pokemon like Umbreon and Mandibuzz stop most Azelf sets and can easily threaten to KO it in return, although having their item removed with Knock Off makes them much less effective in their defensive roles. More offensive Pokemon like Choice Scarf Zarude and Hydreigon outspeed and OHKO Azelf, and Hydreigon can also switch into non-Pivot Azelf if it is not running Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Zarude, Hydreigon, Jirachi, and Diggersby deal significant damage to Azelf with U-turn or simply OHKO it with a strong attack. Noivern, Crobat, and Salazzle outspeed Azelf naturally and also threaten heavy damage. Priority move users like Scizor, Mamoswine, and Azumarill can pick off a chipped Azelf.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon with high Special Defense like Chansey, Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Slowking can withstand Azelf's attacks and hinder it with chip damage or status, and Chansey and Slowing can often use Teleport to bring in an offensive check. However, the former two hate Knock Off and the latter three fear coverage options like Flamethrower and Energy Ball. Even Chansey is 2HKOed by +2 Psyshock with Life Orb.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Psychic is Azelf's strongest and usually preferred STAB move, dealing big damage to the likes of Thundurus-T and Amoonguss, but Psyshock is an option to OHKO Nihilego and deal more damage to Tentacruel and Calm Mind users like Primarina and Keldeo. Flamethrower hits a wide range of defensive Pokemon like Scizor, Skarmory, and Tangrowth, while Fire Blast is a stronger option to help finish off Celesteela and Tangrowth, but the difference in damage is often not worth the accuracy drop. U-turn is Azelf's key move on this set, as its high Speed allows it to pivot out of danger from Pokemon like Mandibuzz and bring in a teammate safely. Azelf's last moves usually depend on the item it is running. If running Expert Belt, Energy Ball or Dazzling Gleam should be used. Energy Ball is the preferred final move to wipe out common foes like Slowking, Hippowdon, and Mamoswine, notably 2HKOing the former two and OHKOing the latter with the Expert Belt boost. Meanwhile, Dazzling Gleam is an option for Dragon-types and bulky Dark-types like Hydreigon, Salamence, Mandibuzz, and Umbreon. If using Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid Stealth Rock damage as Azelf pivots throughout the battle, Knock Off is the preferred final move to remove items from common switch-ins such as Chansey and Mandibuzz so Azelf can attempt to outlast them. Timid is the preffered nature as Azelf is not concerned about U-turn chip damage, though Naive can be used if running Knock Off for extra power as the loss in Special Defense barely affects Azelf and maintaining chip damage from U-turn and Knock Off can be beneficial. 4 Defense EVs ensure Azelf takes a Thousand Arrows from Zygarde-10%.</p> <p>This set fits best on fast-paced balance and offense teams, where its pivot support can assist in getting other hard-hitting Pokemon like Mamoswine onto the field. Azelf is already a strong offensive presence, but wallbreakers like Keldeo, Hydreigon, Conkeldurr, and Mamoswine overwhelm shared checks such as Slowking, Chansey, and Mandibuzz. Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego and Spikes users like Skarmory put even more stress on the opposing team. Nihilego also can pressure Mandibuzz and wear down Slowking. Excadrill compresses setting and removing entry hazards, enabling Expert Belt Azelf to come in and break through the enemy team more easily. Azelf works best in combination with other pivots such as Zarude, Thundurus-T, and Slowking; all of which appreciating Azelf taking on Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Zarude can counter Hippowdon and Slowking and bring Azelf in against Skarmory, Thundurus-T can threaten Mandibuzz and Crobat, and a Slowking of your own can be used as a slower, defensive pivot to bring in Azelf against Pokemon like Tangrowth. Scizor can lure in Cobalion and Skarmory and use U-turn to give Azelf opportunities to wallbreak while also picking off priority users that threaten Azelf like Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine. Tangrowth and Amoonguss help check dangerous revenge killers like Diggersby and Zarude for Azelf, while Azelf can threaten Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela. Primarina can handle many threats to Azelf, including Mandibuzz and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, while Azelf can threaten Grass-types like Amoonguss. In addition to Primarina, bulky Pokemon like Slowking and Salamence can make up for Azelf's frailty by defensively answering threats to it.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>+2 Azelf can dismantle nearly the entire tier, depending on what coverage moves it chooses. Psyshock is usually preferred for STAB to OHKO Nihilego and Tentacruel before a boost and better threaten Chansey and Calm Mind Primarina. However, Psychic is an option to do more neutral damage to Pokemon like Salamence and Mamoswine if Azelf is not running super effective coverage for them. Fire Blast covers Grass-types like Tangrowth and Steel-types like Celesteela, OHKOing all after Nasty Plot. Azelf's other coverage depends on the team's needs. Energy Ball wipes out Swampert, Hippowdon, and Slowking. Dazzling Gleam hits Dark- and Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Umbreon, Mandibuzz, and Salamence. Substitute is an option over either of these moves to give it a safety net to either set up easier or take a hit and retaliate back. Azelf can often get up Substitute against who rely on hindering it with status like Hippowdon as well as Pokemon it forces out like Keldeo. Expert Belt is usually the preferred item on this set, as it allows Azelf to fire off attacks without consequence while still dealing enough damage to OHKO defensive Pokemon like Celesteela after Nasty Plot. Life Orb can be used for even more damage, in particular against Pokemon Azelf lacks coverage for like Chansey and Hatterene. Unfortunately, Life Orb wears down Azelf fairly quickly and leaves it susceptible to priority attacks like Bullet Punch from Scizor. Focus Sash allows Azelf to safely take a hit and boost or avoid being revenge killed, though this item is unreliable as it can easily be broken by Stealth Rock.</p> <p>This set fits best on hyper offense teams, whose teammates can support Azelf. An entry hazard setter like Scolipede helps facilitate an Azelf sweep, and Excadrill can both set hazards and remove them. Azelf is naturally fast, but a Sticky Web setter like Ribombee invalidates Choice Scarf users like Diggersby and Zarude, letting Azelf easily sweep most teams. Sticky Web also allows Azelf to attack Starmie and Zygarde-10% without risking a Speed tie. Strong physical sweepers, like Gyarados and Diggersby, can work as secondary sweepers against teams that carry multiple stops to Azelf. Azelf can set up on most checks to these physical sweepers, including Tangrowth and Skarmory. A wallbreaker like Mamoswine can break through many checks to Azelf, such as Mandibuzz and Chansey, to allow Azelf to more easily sweep. Thundurus-T can also help threaten Pokemon like Mandibuzz, as Azelf struggles to break through it even with Dazzling Gleam. Nihilego can serve as a secondary sweeper with Meteor Beam and important coverage in moves such as Sludge Wave and Thunderbolt, while Azelf can assist in removing or weakening Nihilego's checks like Slowking, Chansey, and Jirachi.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill has valuable role compression in UU as an Electric-immune entry hazard remover and potential Stealth Rock setter. It has the typing to check many threatening foes like Nihilego, Togekiss, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro. Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to bypass abilities like Levitate from Rotom-W and Magic Bounce from Hatterene to KO them or set Stealth Rock. Excadrill can also utilize a suicide lead set on hyper offense teams to pave the way for dangerous sweepers like Celesteela and Thundurus-T. Excadrill can also be a potent late-game cleaner with a Swords Dance + Rapid Spin set, boosting up to break through walls like Chansey and Amoonguss and clean through weakened teams. However, Excadrill is extremely vulnerable to the tier's Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-type Pokemon like Keldeo, Zarude, and Conkeldurr, all of which can easily take advantage of it due to their higher Speed or access to priority. Excadrill struggles to bypass common threats like Skarmory, Hippowdon, Moltres, and Celesteela. Skarmory and Hippowdon are especially troublesome, as Excadrill struggles to keep entry hazards removed against the most prevalent setters in the tier. Furthermore, Excadrill's defensive stats are lackluster without investment, which hinders its role as a Steel-type when checking threats like Hatterene and Hydreigon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On Hippowdon teams, Excadrill can use Sand Rush over Mold Breaker to be the fastest threat in the tier, though sand isn't a prominent archetype in UU and Excadrill fails to beat Celesteela and Skarmory anyway. Choice Scarf allows Excadrill to revenge kill threats like Azelf and be the fastest entry hazard remover in the tier, but it is typically undesirable to be locked into any of its moves. Sand Force alongside Choice Band on Sand teams turns Excadrill into a very dangerous wallbreaker, but like Choice Scarf this set struggles because Excadrill hates being locked into any of its moves. Assault Vest lets Excadrill better tank hits from Hydreigon and Galarian Slowbro, though it misses out on the passive recovery Leftovers provides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Skarmory, Celesteela, and Moltres resist Excadrill's STAB combination, with the former two also being immune to Toxic. However, Moltres dislikes getting hit with Rock Tomb from suicide lead variants. Thundurus-T outspeeds Excadrill and nails it with Focus Blast. Salamence can switch into Excadrill and lower its Attack with Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Swampert and Slowking can take a hit from Excadrill and retaliate with a super effective attack. Gyarados can use variants without Toxic as setup fodder. Azumarill and Keldeo can revenge kill Excadrill easily.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth's massive physical bulk allows it to wall most Excadrill variants, though it has to be careful when taking on Swords Dance sets, as they can break through it with an Iron Head flinch, and Tangrowth needs chip damage to KO Excadrill back. Zarude's natural bulk lets it pivot into Excadrill; it does not fear Toxic because of Jungle Healing and forces it out due to its higher Speed. Dhelmise can block Rapid Spin attempts from Excadrill and threaten it back with heavy damage.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Cobalion and Keldeo outspeed and force out Excadrill. Conkeldurr has enough physical bulk to take an Earthquake and recover its health with Drain Punch or OHKO Excadrill with Mach Punch if at full health.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Faster threats like Krookodile, Zygarde-10%, Hydreigon, and Lycanroc-D all outspeed and threaten Excadrill. However, none of these Pokemon want to switch into it, barring Krookodile, which can in a pinch.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Earthquake and Iron Head provide fantastic coverage for Excadrill, slamming common threats like Galarian Slowbro, Nihilego, and Mamoswine. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill clear entry hazards thanks to matching up well against other entry hazard setters like Nihilego and Chansey. Toxic burdens defensive checks like Tangrowth, Slowking, and Hippowdon, allowing Excadrill or a teammate to get past them in the long-term. However, Toxic is useless against certain answers like Skarmory. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be run for more role compression thanks to Excadrill pressuring entry hazard control like Rotom-W and Hatterene and being able to set up Stealth Rock against Pokemon like Nihilego and Jirachi thanks to its typing. Moreover, finding another Pokemon to run Stealth Rock can strain teambuilding, though Excadrill becomes unable to cripple and wear down threats like Hippowdon. Magnet Rise is an option over Iron Head to completely shut down Hippowdon from setting up Stealth Rock, being immune to Earthquake and punishing it with Toxic, though Excadrill's offensive capabilities become more limited. Mold Breaker bypasses Levitate from Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Hydreigon, allowing Excadrill to severely damage them with Earthquake while also allowing Excadrill to circumvent Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Maximum Attack investment lets Excadrill threaten Amoonguss and Primarina as much as possible, though maximum investment in Special Defense in an option to better check threats like Hatterene, Rotom-W, and Galarian Slowbro via directly switching in.</p> <p>Excadrill both removing and setting entry hazards gives it a place on many bulky offense and balance teams. Thundurus-T is a great partner that can remove Flying-types like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Moltres that hinder Excadrill. Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can switch into Water- and Grass-types like Azumarill and Zarude for Excadrill. They also scare out Hippowdon. Fighting-type checks like Salamence and Slowking provide great support against threats like Cobalion and Conkeldurr, with Salamence also beating Grass-types like Zarude and Tangrowth as well as helping Excadrill keep entry hazards off the field thanks to it beating entry hazard setters it struggles with like Skarmory and Swampert. Salamence also beats bulky variants of Swords Dance Scizor. Other entry hazard setters like Nihilego and Cobalion can cover setting Stealth Rock for Excadrill, freeing up a moveslot to run Toxic. Fast offensive threats like Zygarde-10%, Azelf, and Salazzle appreciate Excadrill's support and can deal with faster threats like Thundurus-T and Hydreigon. The latter two also check Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Skarmory.</p>"

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Excadrill is a great suicide lead for hyper offense teams thanks to Mold Breaker, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock against Hatterene and pressure Rotom-W with Earthquake. Rapid Spin supports its team against opposing Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego and Swampert. Excadrill also keeps Sticky Web off the field thanks to its amazing matchup against Ribombee, which normally hinders many hyper offense teams. Rock Tomb heavily damages Thundurus-T and Moltres and slows down faster threats like Zarude for its teammates to set up on. Steel Beam is an option that allows Excadrill to retain momentum after setting up Stealth Rock, preventing Defoggers like Salamence from removing Stealth Rock. A Focus Sash guarantees Excadrill can survive a hit and get up Stealth Rock before fainting.</p> <p>This Excadrill set fits best on hyper offense teams, allowing teammates to come in and sweep after setting up Stealth Rock. Deadly setup sweepers like Thundurus-T, Gyarados, and Celesteela all appreciate entry hazard support wearing down checks like Chansey, Skarmory, and Nihilego. Thundurus-T takes advantage of the Flying-types Excadrill lets in like Skarmory and Celesteela, while the latter two also appreciate Excadrill removing opposing Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, preventing chip damage so they can sweep more easily. Rapid Spin support also allows Gyarados to run items like Mystic Water instead of Heavy-Duty Boots. Spikes leads like Scolipede can form an entry hazard stacking core with Excadrill.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance boosts Excadrill's Attack to sky-high levels, letting it overwhelm the sturdiest of physical walls like Tangrowth and Amoonguss with its STAB moves if Stealth Rock is up. In conjunction with Mold Breaker, it can break through Quagsire's Unaware. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill compress entry hazard removal alongside boosting its Speed, making it a dangerous late-game threat, as faster threats like Zygarde-10% can no longer revenge kill it. Rock Slide is an option to slam Moltres, which otherwise counters this set, and hit Thundurus-T and Celesteela, but it only should be used if the team can fit entry hazard removal elsewhere. Leftovers makes Excadrill harder to wear down, further facilitating its sweeping attempts.</p> <p>Excadrill best fits on offensive teams that give it ample opportunities to wallbreak. Pivot support from Zarude, Thundurus-T, and Slowking can bring Excadrill in safely to set up against their checks like Togekiss and Chansey. Notably, Slowking is a slow pivot, providing Excadrill with a free switch with Teleport. Slowking and Thundurus-T are also great at taking advantage of Celesteela and Skarmory, both of which wall Excadrill. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can provide a key defensive backbone for Excadrill, taking on threats like Conkeldurr, Hippowdon, and Azumarill. Entry hazard support from Nihilego and Swampert is key in helping Excadrill break through physical walls like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Early-game wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Conkeldurr can weaken walls like Celesteela and Moltres for it to cleanly sweep late-game. Other Steel-types like Celesteela and Jirachi can make up for Excadrill's frailty by checking threats it normally would like Hydreigon and Hatterene.</p>"

  "Conkeldurr": {
    "overview": "<p>Guts Conkeldurr is one of UU's most devastating wallbreakers. Once burned by Flame Orb, it can evade status from defensive staples like Amoonguss and Chansey. Knock Off and Ice Punch or Facade offer virtually perfect coverage alongside its powerful Drain Punch or Close Combat, allowing it to dismantle defensive cores like Chansey and Quagsire. STAB Mach Punch is also a great tool, functioning as a strong priority attack that can threaten faster Pokemon like Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Hydreigon. Conkeldurr is a bit weighed down by its proneness to being worn down from Flame Orb, however. This is made a larger problem by its poor Speed, which allows the tier's many faster threats like Keldeo and Salamence to overwhelm it, as well as its iffy defensive typing, which doesn't give it many notable resistances and leaves it open to Pokemon like Moltres, Togekiss, Primarina, and Salamence. Moreover, sand chip from Hippowdon wears down Conkeldurr. Conkeldurr also faces competition from Fighting-types like Keldeo, who offers comparable power in addition to greater Speed and an additional Water-typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Bulk Up set with investment in Special Defense can function as a solid bulky sweeper that can absorb status. Conkeldurr could hold Assault Vest to more easily switch into Scald from Pokemon like Raikou and Quagsire while also checking special attackers such as Nihilego. However, this often prevents it from being able to maximize its offensive potential, and it is still quite prone to being worn down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Defensive Salamence is a particularly good check to Conkeldurr because of its ability to always take a hit from full HP thanks to Intimidate, allowing it to switch into Conkeldurr and threaten it with Dual Wingbeat. Skarmory's massive physical bulk lets it switch into a weaker attack from Conkeldurr and nail it with Brave Bird. Togekiss and Crobat can also be a solid checks, 4x resisting Conkeldurr's STAB moves and revenge killing it. Moltres resists Mach Punch and can power through Conkeldurr with Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Slowking and Galarian Slowbro can take Knock Off from full HP while severely damaging Conkeldurr with STAB Psychic-type attacks. Necrozma and Azelf outspeed and pressure Conkeldurr with their powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Although it takes hefty damage from Facade, bulky Primarina can restore its health as it dents Conkeldurr with Draining Kiss, while its Choice Specs sets can outrun and OHKO it outright. Azumarill outspeeds Conkeldurr, resists Mach Punch, and can KO it with Play Rough. Hatterene can trade with Conkeldurr and restore health with Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Conkeldurr's low Speed and Flame Orb use leave it quite vulnerable to being overwhelmed by faster Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Nidoking, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T.</p>",

However, Close Combat is also an option for its massive damage output, crushing defensive staples like Celesteela and Skarmory. Facade heavily damages various Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, including Nidoqueen, Amoonguss, and Primarina. Ice Punch KOes Conkeldurr's most common counter in defensive Salamence while hitting threats like Hippowdon and Tangrowth super effectively. However, Conkeldurr becomes walled by Primarina. Knock Off nails foes such as Galarian Slowbro, Chandelure, and Slowking. It also removes items from switch-ins like Salamence, Togekiss, and Moltres, crippling them heavily. Mach Punch is a strong priority move that can pressure faster foes like Hydreigon, Excadrill, and Zarude while picking off weakened threats in general. An Adamant nature is preferred in order to maximize Conkeldurr's wallbreaking potential.</p> <p>Conkeldurr generally fits well on more offensively oriented builds. Some balance teams appreciate the offensive pressure it offers, too. Due to Conkeldurr's tendency to wearing itself down, it appreciates Grassy Terrain support from Tapu Bulu for passive recovery. Tapu Bulu also checks faster threats to Conkeldurr like Primarina and Azumarill. Conkeldurr struggles to break through physical walls like Tangrowth and Hippowdon in the short term, so teammates who can threaten these like Moltres and Zarude are appreciated. Entry hazard setters like Nihilego and Swampert can wear down checks like Skarmory with Stealth Rock for Conkeldurr to muscle through easier. Nihilego can also check many revenge killers to Conkeldurr like Togekiss, Salamence, and Crobat. Slow pivots like Chansey, Slowking, and Mandibuzz can help bring Conkeldurr into play against threats like Excadrill, Zarude, and Lycanroc-D. Slowking can also provide Future Sight support to further amplify Conkeldurr's wallbreaking power. Late-game cleaners like Thundurus-T and Scizor are able to clean up after Conkeldurr softens up the opposing team. In return, it can pressure Flying-types like Togekiss and Salamence.

Seismitoad has a positive matchup against some of the entry hazard removers of the tier, such as Rotom-W, Salamence, and Excadrill, through potent utility moves like Toxic and Knock Off. However, Seismitoad's lack of reliable recovery outside of Leftovers makes it vulnerable to status effects and Knock Off. Seismitoad's crippling weakness to Grass-types gives Pokemon like Amoonguss and Zarude free entry and bad matchups against threats that carry Grass-type coverage moves such as Nihilego and Gyarados. Seismitoad also faces massive competition from Swampert, who shares the same typing, is bulkier, and has Flip Turn to not be a momentum sink. However, Seismitoad's access to Knock Off gives it an important niche over Swampert on bulkier teams that need the role compression. Seismitoad also has to compete with other Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon and Cobalion, which offer greater offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seismitoad can run an offensive Stealth Rock set on rain teams that enjoy its immunity to Electric-type attacks. With moves like Hydro Pump, Earth Power, and Sludge Wave, it can tear through many teams. However, even with a Life Orb and a rain boost, 85 Special Attack may not cut it at times. Rain teams generally prefer Kingdra as a wallbreaker as well due to its better typing. A physical Seismitoad on rain teams can open the door for teammates like Kingdra by blowing through Chansey, Salamence, and Swampert with Earthquake, Ice Punch, and Power Whip, respectively, though this gives Seismitoad a worse matchup against Skarmory and Tangrowth. Seismitoad can run more offensive EV spreads on its traditional Stealth Rock set with good coverage options such as Sludge Wave. However, this considerably cuts into Seismitoad's bulk, which is often less than ideal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves</strong>: Seismitoad's defensive set often invites in Pokemon like Tangrowth and Amoonguss, which are difficult to outlast due to Regenerator. Zarude has Jungle Healing to remove status, making it a complete counter to Seismitoad. Dhelmise can force Seismitoad out as it removes Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. This weakness to Grass also means that Pokemon such as Gyarados, Thundurus-T, and Nihilego can threaten Seismitoad with coverage moves like Power Whip and Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Offensive threats like Azelf, Hydreigon, Diggersby, and Conkeldurr greatly hinder Seismitoad's ability to act as a defensive wall because of their powerful secondary STAB attacks, taking advantage of its passivity and lack of recovery. However, they do not appreciate switching into Seismitoad due to its STAB moves or fear of status.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Seismitoad greatly fears Toxic from common Pokemon like Chansey and Swampert, including Pokemon it would normally check like Celesteela, Salamence, and Cobalion, as its already limited longevity becomes worsened.</p>",

Krookodile can also run a Choice Scarf set to be a decent revenge killer to the likes of Azelf and Raikou, but this set faces competition from other Choice Scarf users like Diggersby and Hydreigon due to them being stronger and having access to U-turn. Krookodile can opt for a more offensive Choice Scarf set with Moxie, letting it accumulate Attack boosts as it KOes enemies. However, the utility that Intimidate offers is more worth it to weaken Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, and Krookodile can't break past Grass-types and Hippowdon without enough boosts.

Amoonguss can check Pokemonn like Primarina and Zarude for Krookodile, and together they can keep Lycanroc-D in check. Salamence forms a double Intimidate core with Krookodile, weakening Pokemon like Zarude and stopping setup sweepers like Gyarados from getting out of control. Krookodile is vulnerable against Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Togekiss so partners like Scizor, Rotom-W, and Tentacruel are valuable.</p>"

  "Darmanitan": {
    "overview": "<p>Darmanitan is a great wallbreaker and revenge killer on sun teams, with its sun-boosted Flare Blitz being extremely difficult to switch into. Under sun, even the sturdiest of Water-types like Slowking and RestTalk Primarina cannot switch in without risking a 2HKO. Its coverage moves also hit most Fire-resistant Pokemon for good damage, with Rock Slide hitting Moltres and Rotom-H, while Earthquake OHKOes Nihilego and lets Darmanitan revenge kill Tentacruel. Both coverage moves also don't have recoil damage. Darmanitan can be difficult to revenge kill, as it resists Scizor's Bullet Punch and many faster threats are unable to switch in safely. However, its poor bulk and Stealth Rock weakness severely limit its entry points, and it is still forced out by revenge killers such as Lycanroc-D, Azumarill, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon once they are in. Flare Blitz, its main STAB attack, has substantial recoil damage that racks up over time, which reduces Darmanitan's overall longevity. It also struggles to break past Fire-resistant Pokemon with recovery if it lacks sun support, like Primarina and Salamence. Darmanitan faces competition as a Choice Scarf user with Diggersby, which has better longevity due to its Stealth Rock resistance and lack of recoil damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trick is an option to debilitate defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Chansey, and Primarina. However, it sacrifices the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, so it should only be used when Choice Scarf is no longer necessary, and has to replace a coverage move. Choice Band can further increase Darmanitan's power, but it becomes more vulnerable to revenge killers like Nihilego and Cobalion, and the additional power is mostly unnecessary. Heavy-Duty Boots grants Darmanitan more longevity, letting it fit on different team archetypes, but the loss of Speed and inability to avoid recoil from being forced into using Flare Blitz prevents it from fulfilling an offensive pivot role that well compared to other options like Azelf.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to not commonly running Heavy-Duty Boots, Darmanitan takes substantial entry hazard damage upon switching in. With that and Flare Blitz recoil, Darmanitan gets worn down very quickly. Hippowdon's summoned sand also wears down Darmanitan and removes sun.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Salamence, Hydreigon, and Zygarde-10% all present problems for Darmanitan. Defensive Salamence is the best counter available, resisting Flare Blitz and also lowering Darmanitan's Attack with Intimidate. Salamence can also use Roost to heal any damage that Darmanitan inflicts. Zygarde-10% and Choice Scarf Hydreigon revenge kills Darmanitan, and they can potentially predict Darmanitan switching out to wallbreak.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Primarina, Slowking, Swampert, and Rotom-W are solid checks that can tank a hit and heavily damage Darmanitan with their STAB moves. However, if sun is active, they might struggle to switch in on Flare Blitz. Keldeo acts as an offensive check, but it doesn't like to directly switch in, and Azumarill can revenge kill Darmanitan with Aqua Jet.</p>",

U-turn allows Darmanitan to take advantage of the switches it forces and pivot out on Pokemon that aren't 2HKOed by Flare Blitz, like Primarina and Slowking. Rock Slide hits Flying-types such as Salamence and Moltres, and Earthquake OHKOes Nihilego while also hitting Cobalion, Zygarde-10%, and Excadrill without incurring recoil. Choice Scarf ensures that Darmanitan can outspeed Pokemon such as Azelf, Zygarde-10%, and Crobat.</p> <p>Darmanitan best fits on sun teams, which appreciate its revenge killing while strengthening its nuclear Flare Blitz. Torkoal is the cornerstone of sun teams, providing Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and sun. Venusaur sets up on foes that threaten Darmanitan, such as Keldeo and Primarina lacking Psychic. In exchange, Darmanitan can break through Celesteela and trade with Noivern, as well as pivoting out of bad matchups like Primarina and Keldeo to give Venusaur setup opportunities. Defensive Celesteela checks Hydreigon and Excadrill, while Darmanitan breaks through Celesteela checks like Chansey. Hatterene checks Dragon-types such as Salamence and Hydreigon, provides Magic Bounce support, and can heal Darmanitan's chip damage from Stealth Rock with Healing Wish. Swampert and Chansey are great pivots that can bring in Darmanitan safely against Excadrill and Krookodile, with Swampert checking Rotom-W and Chansey checking Hydreigon. Skarmory can provide Spikes support, which is valuable in providing chip damage for Darmanitan. It also handles many physical attackers that threaten Darmanitan, such as Diggersby and Hippowdon, well.</p>"

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus is a unique Pokemon that serves as a slow yet bulky and powerful wallbreaker with good longevity. Its ability, Magic Guard, allows it to completely ignore passive damage, such as Toxic from Chansey and Hippowdon, as well as sand damage from the latter. Magic Guard also negates Life Orb recoil, which, in tandem with its high natural Special Attack stat, makes it extremely difficult to switch into, and its coverage options in Focus Blast and Thunder are able to wipe out checks like Zarude, Hydreigon, Mandibuzz, and Celesteela. Reuniclus's bulk allows it to trade with and KO common Pokemon such as Moltres, Salamence, and Zygarde-10% with enough prior chip damage. However, Reuniclus is terribly slow and often relies on prediction. It is also prone to getting overwhelmed by offensive teams, which give it very few chances to use Recover. Psychic is also a fairly mediocre defensive typing because it doesn't resist common attacks and is weak to the omnipresent Knock Off and U-turn, which means Reuniclus is often forced into using Recover more than it would like to, further limiting its offensive presence. Furthermore, Focus Blast and Thunder's poor accuracies make using an attack that isn't Psychic a gamble. Reuniclus also faces heavy competition from Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Azelf; the former has more expansive coverage and a better defensive typing, while the latter is faster, generating momentum with U-turn and progress with Knock Off. Reuniclus is stronger than both, however, and can ignore passive damage like sand and entry hazards, making it harder to overwhelm.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Calm Mind sets with maximum Defense investment make Reuniclus a potent stallbreaker thanks to its immunity to Toxic, turning traditional checks like Chansey and Hippowdon into setup bait. However, this set is largely outclassed by Galarian Slowbro, which has a more useful typing to set up more easily and greater offensive potency. Calm Mind + Trick + Sticky Barb sets can take switch-ins like Zarude and Scizor out of commission, but this set still struggles into Dark-types and requires extensive team support. Stored Power sets with Calm Mind and Acid Armor allow Reuniclus to boost its defenses and potentially snowball enemy teams, but this set is largely unreliable because it cannot touch Dark-types and Reuniclus will be a dead weight if it fails to safely boost. Assault Vest Reuniclus makes use of Regenerator by scouting powerful special attackers like Keldeo and Primarina, while setting itself apart from Galarian Slowbro with its access to Knock Off. However, Galarian Slowbro is usually better in this role as well, having much more of an offensive presence by virtue of its great coverage. As a defensive pivot, Assault Vest Reuniclus also faces competition from Slowking and Chansey, both being much safer options due to their access to Teleport. Offensive Trick Room Reuniclus is an option that turns its horrible Speed stat into an advantage. However, it usually isn't favored, as Reuniclus has to give up Recover to use Trick Room, severely cutting into its longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type coverage</strong>: Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Zarude are extremely threatening for Reuniclus, though they hate taking Focus Blast. Mandibuzz can pivot into most of Reuniclus's attacks and slowly rack up chip damage with U-turn; it can't switch in on Thunder, though. Knock Off from Tangrowth, Scizor, and Diggersby is also particularly dangerous for Reuniclus, as it hates losing its item and taking massive damage from the latter two.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Chandelure, Mamoswine, and Keldeo can force out Reuniclus to an extent, as it does not want to take chip damage that forces it into using Recover more often. Its terrible Speed makes it difficult to find chances to Recover against offensive teams as well.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Bulky special walls, including Slowking and Chansey, give Reuniclus an extremely hard time, as both can pivot in on its STAB move and use it for easy momentum into a dangerous threat with Teleport. However, Slowking must be wary of Thunder.</p>",

      "Life Orb + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<p>Psychic nails threats like Hippowdon, Amoonguss, and Salamence. Thunder allows Reuniclus to severely threaten Pokemon resistant or immune to Psychic, such as Celesteela, Slowking, and Mandibuzz, whilst also hitting Primarina super effectively. Focus Blast allows Reuniclus to OHKO common Steel- and Dark-types including Excadrill, Hydreigon, and Zarude. Recover increases its longevity to give it more wallbreaking opportunities; Reuniclus can have several opportunities to heal in front of passive walls such as Skarmory and Slowking. Life Orb is used to further bolster its wallbreaking potential, as it suffers none of its drawbacks due to Magic Guard. The given EVs allow Reuniclus to maximize its bulk in order to trade versus threats like Keldeo and Salamence while hitting as hard as possible. It also guarantees that Reuniclus survives Fire Blast from Azelf after a Nasty Plot boost and avoids a 2HKO from Nihilego's Sludge Bomb.</p> <p>Reuniclus fits on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its solid offensive profile and coverage that threatens a multitude of Pokemon, like Slowking, Amoonguss, and Skarmory. Cobalion is a solid partner for it, as it can switch into Dark-types like Zarude and Mandibuzz, as well as threaten Chansey. It can also absorb Knock Off and counter Scizor. Hippowdon, Nihilego, Skarmory, and Cobalion are all good entry hazard setters for Reuniclus, as they help wear down threats like Hydreigon, Chansey, and opposing Hippowdon. Hippowdon, in particular, can also soften up Assault Vest Tangrowth with Toxic, making it much easier to break through, while Skarmory can completely counter Scizor. Primarina can pivot in on Dark-types like Hydreigon, as well as prevent Reuniclus from being overwhelmed against the likes of Moltres, Keldeo, and Salamence. Pivots, such as Rotom-W, Zarude, and Mandibuzz, are appreciated to bring in Reuniclus safely against Pokemon like Amoonguss, Nihilego, and Hippowdon. Mandibuzz can also check Dark- and Ghost-types like Hydreigon, Zarude, and Chandelure. Various late-game cleaners, such as Scizor, Raikou, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, are good alongside Reuniclus due to how much pressure it puts on the opposing team, allowing its teammates to clean up after.</p>"

  "Vanilluxe": {
    "overview": "<p>Vanilluxe is a unique wallbreaker in UU, as it takes advantage of Snow Warning to use perfectly accurate Blizzards and crush many unprepared teams. When backed by Choice Specs, it becomes very difficult to switch into, as even Ice-resistant Pokemon like Cobalion, physically defensive Scizor, and Chandelure are 2HKOed by Blizzard. Further, many common Steel-types like Celesteela, Excadrill, and Skarmory are neutral to Ice, meaning they cannot switch in safely at all. Water-types like Slowking and Primarina also can't switch into it due to Freeze-Dry. Since Vanilluxe only needs those two moves to 2HKO most of the tier, it can run Sleep Talk in the third—and last—moveslot, making it a fantastic sleep absorber against Amoonguss and letting it save Blizzard PP. Due to Vanilluxe's reliance on Choice Specs, poor defensive typing, mediocre bulk, and Stealth Rock weakness, it struggles greatly to safely come onto the field. Because of this, Vanilluxe requires the support of pivots and double entry hazard removal cores. Its Speed tier also lets it down, since it is outsped by common offensive Pokemon like Nihilego and Keldeo.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vanilluxe can run Never-Melt Ice with Taunt and Ice Shard to bluff the Choice Specs set, shut down Chansey's recovery, and surprise Zygarde-10%. However, this makes it much easier to PP stall Blizzard and sacrifices power, notably missing out on 2HKOing physically defensive Scizor. Choice Scarf instead of Choice Specs makes Vanilluxe a great revenge killer against faster Pokemon like Crobat, Keldeo, and Zarude. However, this set can be harder to fit due to its lower damage output.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes every attack, can stall out Blizzard with Soft-Boiled, and cripples Vanilluxe with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Specially defensive Scizor can take on Vanilluxe well, recover the damage off with Roost, and hit it with priority Bullet Punch. However, variants lacking Special Defense investment are 2HKOed by Blizzard. Offensive Scizor always OHKOes it with Bullet Punch, but it can't switch in directly. Jirachi can force Vanilluxe out with Iron Head, which lets it pivot out freely or set up a Substitute. Cobalion outspeeds and KOes Vanilluxe, but it cannot switch in on it. Registeel's massive Special Defense lets it set up Iron Defense, Amnesia, or Stealth Rock freely.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Chandelure, Rotom-H, and Moltres outspeed Vanilluxe and KO it, but the former two can't take repeated hits, and the latter is OHKOed by Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock and Knock Off</strong>: Since Vanilluxe needs Choice Specs, it can’t run Heavy-Duty Boots, making it very easy to wear down. Without Choice Specs, Vanilluxe is notably weaker, making it risky to switch into a Pokemon that it should beat, like Tangrowth.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Vanilluxe's middling Speed makes it very easy to revenge kill with Pokemon like Nihilego, Keldeo, and Hydreigon.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Blizzard is incredibly powerful, OHKOing common walls like Tangrowth and Hippowdon while 2HKOing Cobalion, Celesteela, and Nihilego. Freeze-Dry gives it important super effective coverage on Water-types like Primarina, Slowking, and Tentacruel. Sleep Talk lets it absorb Spore from Amoonguss and use Blizzard more often without wasting PP. Vanilluxe only runs three moves on this set so that Sleep Talk calls Freeze-Dry more often against Water-types. Ice Beam can have some use for a fourth move, since a foe like Chansey can easily stall out Blizzard's PP, but it is always the worst move to get when calling Sleep Talk, and Vanilluxe doesn't have much longevity for Ice Beam's PP to be necessary.</p> <p>Vanilluxe is used on bulky offense teams as a wallbreaker that can get past teams that rely on Scizor, Skarmory, and Celesteela as Steel-types, or on bulky Water-types like Slowking and Primarina as their primary special walls. Its Stealth Rock weakness means that entry hazard removal from Excadrill and Salamence is necessary for it to stay healthy and find opportunities to wallbreak. They can also handle Jirachi for Vanilluxe to more easily use its Ice-type moves. Both of these entry hazard removers are commonly used on the same team, since Salamence can handle Skarmory and Hippowdon, while Excadrill counters Nihilego, and having these entry hazard setters beaten helps with Vanilluxe's longevity greatly. Zarude lures in Skarmory and Amoonguss and uses U-turn for Vanilluxe to blast them away with Blizzard. Azelf can more easily deal with other Steel-types like Scizor and faster threats like Keldeo, as well as removing Eviolite from Chansey. It also can bring Vanilluxe in on Mandibuzz, giving it more wallbreaking opportunities. Swampert and the aforementioned Excadrill can set up Stealth Rock, which lets Vanilluxe guarantee a 2HKO on defensive Celesteela with Blizzard, as well as nearly always OHKOing Slowking with Freeze-Dry after hail chip damage. Both entry hazard setters take on Rotom-H, and Swampert lures in Tangrowth and Amoonguss for Vanilluxe. Slowking and Chansey provide a defensive backbone against Cobalion and Nihilego, and they let Vanilluxe get in safely with Teleport. Physical attackers like Swords Dance Scizor and Cobalion can take advantage of Chansey for Vanilluxe.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a potent defensive wall due to its good defensive typing, which enables it to check dangerous foes such as Azumarill, Primarina, and Zarude, combined with its access to Regenerator. Access to Spore allows Amoonguss to shut down an opposing foe completely, making it harder to play around and offensively check due to pressuring opponents to choose sleep fodder. Its Poison typing additionally gives it an edge over other common Grass-types, as it is able to threaten Tangrowth and Zarude with Sludge Bomb, which also prevents them from switching in to absorb Spore. However, despite Amoonguss's good defensive typing, it struggles against metagame staples like Salamence and Crobat. It can also be overwhelmed by Pokemon it is supposed to check due to their access to coverage, such as Ice Punch from Azumarill, Psychic from Primarina, and Air Slash from Keldeo. After using Spore, Amoonguss is easy to take advantage of by Pokemon that take little from its other moves such as Galarian Slowbro, Celesteela, Skarmory, and Cobalion. Amoonguss faces competition from Tangrowth as a defensive Grass-type wall, which can opt to run Assault Vest sets to check specially offensive foes such as Thundurus-T better, not be neutral to Excadrill and Zygarde-10%'s Ground-type STAB, and avoid being setup bait for Swords Dance Cobalion if something else has been hit with Spore.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seed Bomb keeps Amoonguss from being set up on by Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina, but it does less damage to most other Water-types and loses out on the recovery of Giga Drain, not to mention a burn from Scald can render this move useless. Stomping Tantrum is an option to hit Nihilego and Cobalion for solid damage rather than rely on Spore to neuter them. Assault Vest allows Amoonguss to act as an even better check to special attackers like Keldeo and Thundurus-T, and it can still run utility moves like Spore due to Amoonguss's tendency to get hit with Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types and Psychic-type coverage</strong>: Offensive Psychic-types like Necrozma and Azelf can force out Amoonguss with their powerful attacks. If it has Safety Goggles, Galarian Slowbro can easily setup on Amoonguss. Psychic-type coverage like Psychic Fangs on Lycanroc-D and Psychic on Primarina and Thundurus-T also dent Amoonguss.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rotom-H threatens Amoonguss with Overheat and can gain momentum with Volt Switch. Moltres and Chandelure can threaten to OHKO Amoonguss with their powerful STAB.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types and Flying-type Coverage</strong>: Salamence and Togekiss deal heavy damage to Amoonguss with their STAB attacks. Skarmory, Crobat, and Celesteela don't fear anything from Amoonguss barring Spore and can easily take advantage of it when Spore is used. Flying-type coverage like Air Slash on Keldeo and Dual Wingbeat on Scizor keep Amoonguss from reliably taking them on, leaving it to be careful switching into them.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: While Amoonguss is bulky, it can be overwhelmed by wallbreakers such as Nidoking, Mamoswine, Zygarde-10%, and Hydreigon. These Pokemon all fear Spore, however, so they can only effectively threaten Amoonguss if a teammate has been put to sleep or they are brought in safely. Conkeldurr is able to overwhelm Amoonguss with Facade and is immune to Spore once its Flame Orb activates. Cobalion completely counters Amoonguss after Spore and can freely use it to boost with Swords Dance.</p>",

Stun Spore is an option that can be run over Spore to potentially cripple Pokemon like Celesteela, Cobalion, and Nihilego that would otherwise wall it once a Pokemon has been slept. It can also be used more often due to Sleep Clause. Giga Drain heavily damages Rotom-W and Keldeo, which Amoonguss naturally checks by virtue of its typing and bulk. It also enables Amoonguss to regain some HP, reducing the need for it to continually pivot for Regenerator recovery. Alternatively, Synthesis can be run to instantly regain health, though its low PP should be noticed, and Hippowdon's sand can limit the amount of health recovered by it. Sludge Bomb threatens Primarina, Zarude, and Azumarill. It is also useful for the chance to poison switch-ins such as Salamence and Mandibuzz. Foul Play dents physical attackers such as Gyarados and Scizor and prevents them from setting up on Amoonguss, and it is also Amoonguss's best way to damage other Steel-types such as Jirachi. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers Amoonguss switches into such as Azumarill and Zarude. Black Sludge is an alternative option that reduces Amoonguss's reliance on switching out to regain HP with Regenerator. Eject Button can be run so Amoonguss can pivot into a foe, take a hit, and bring in a teammate safely. 36 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Amoonguss can take a Choice Specs-boosted Psychic from Primarina as well as better check Keldeo.</p> <p>Amoonguss fits best on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check dangerous metagame staples such as Tangrowth and Primarina. Chansey can take on special attackers like Nidoking, Moltres, and Salamence that can overwhelm Amoonguss. Checks to Moltres and Salamence, such as Hippowdon and Primarina, are useful partners that can switch into them and force it out. They also can take on Cobalion after Spore has been burned. Krookodile and Mandibuzz can check Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro and Azelf. Mandibuzz also helps Amoonguss not get overwhelmed by Zygarde-10%. Slower wallbreakers like Conkeldurr appreciate Salamence and Skarmory being crippled by Stun Spore. Amoonguss is heavily threatened by Fire-types such as Moltres and Rotom-H, so checks to these such as Slowking and Swampert make good partners. Amoonguss is vulnerable to Stealth Rock and Spikes chip damage, and gives free opportunities for Pokemon such as Nihilego and Skarmory to set these after Spore has been used, so entry hazard removal support from partners such as Salamence and Excadrill enables it to switch in more often and prevents entry hazards from cancelling out its Regenerator recovery.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Jellicent establishes itself a niche in UU on balance and stall teams through its combination of valuable defensive typing and stallbreaking capabilities. Its typing and Will-O-Wisp allow it to check a variety of highly viable Pokemon such as Scizor, Cobalion, and Keldeo, while Taunt lets it shut down defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Celesteela, and Skarmory; shutting down the first in particular gives it a great matchup versus opposing bulky teams. Jellicent has two useful abilities as well. Cursed Body Jellicent can eventually overpower certain defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and RestTalk Primarina by potentially disabling their only moves that can harm it. Cursed Body also lets it switch into Scald and potentially take a burn to avoid being poisoned later on. On the other hand, Water Absorb makes Jellicent an even more reliable Water-type check, countering rarer threats such as rain wallbreakers or SubCM Keldeo and deterring Choice Specs Primarina from spamming a Water-type attack. While Jellicent has an impressive defensive profile, its need to invest heavily into Speed to outspeed Skarmory and Conkeldurr leaves it with less-than-ideal bulk, which can make it struggle to reliably and comfortably check Pokemon such as Excadrill, Swords Dance + Stone Edge Cobalion, and Swords Dance + Knock Off Scizor if lacking Colbur Berry. Jellicent must also be wary of status, especially on balance teams lacking cleric support. Multiple Pokemon it would otherwise like to pressure such as Hippowdon, Chansey, non-Giga Drain Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowbro can potentially poison Jellicent if it hasn't taken a Scald burn. This forces Jellicent to be more predictable with Taunt versus Toxic users, such as the former two, and more careful around Sludge Bomb users like the latter two. With cleric support on stall teams, status is less of an issue, but Jellicent's need for passive turns is still very much present, and it can offer wallbreakers such as Thundurus-T and Hydreigon free entry still.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jellicent can consider running Scald over Will-O-Wisp to more directly threaten certain Pokemon such as Nihilego, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking, alongside the ability to burn Hatterene, but the unreliable burn chance gives up a lot of solidity against dangerous physical attackers such as Scizor and Cobalion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss and Tangrowth dislike Will-O-Wisp but can force Jellicent out with the threat of their Grass-type moves or Sludge Bomb poisons, although Amoonguss can struggle to deal with a Jellicent burned by Scald, especially in the absence of Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Zarude's Jungle Healing makes it a particularly problematic counter to Jellicent, although it can be forced to burn its PP over a longer match. Hydreigon takes very little damage from anything Jellicent can use and can force it out, but Choice item sets lacking Roost will find themselves worn down quickly over a longer game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-W takes very little damage from anything Jellicent can use and can safely pivot into it. However, it can't make damage stick on Jellicent, as Recover can negate the damage Volt Switch does. Thundurus-T can easily threaten Jellicent but lacks enough power to truly dissuade Recover with Volt Switch, unless it carries Nasty Plot and/or Thunderbolt. Rotom-H is immune to Will-O-Wisp and can threaten Jellicent with Toxic. Raikou cannot switch into Jellicent particularly safely but, due to running Heavy-Duty Boots, it is unfazed by entry hazards and can threaten it with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Jellicent has to be very careful in practice around Toxic and Sludge Bomb users, as its lack of Leftovers can make poison a severe hindrance. This can limit Jellicent's ability to directly switch into Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Chansey that it can pressure, and it lets Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Galarian Slowbro pressure Jellicent with Sludge Bomb. When facing Cursed Body Jellicent, one must not let it take a Scald burn against Pokemon such as Primarina or Slowking if wishing to poison it, though; Jellicent will be able to reliably face these Poison-types afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to investing many EVs in Speed, Jellicent can struggle to check Pokemon its base stats suggest it can, such as Mamoswine and Excadrill. Therefore, they can potentially overwhelm Jellicent if they catch it trying to switch into an Icicle Crash or Iron Head, and Jellicent can't comfortably spinblock against the latter.</p>",

Night Shade is an option over Hex for more direct and consistent damage to targets such as Hydreigon. Cursed Body is preferred to improve Jellicent's matchup versus Pokemon such as RestTalk Primarina. The ability to receive Scald burns, unlike Water Absorb Jellicent, also lets it better face Pokemon such as Amoonguss, with Cursed Body potentially shutting down Giga Drain variants too. On more balanced teams, Water Absorb is an option to better deter Choice Specs Keldeo and Primarina from spamming Water-type moves. Water Absorb can also improve the matchup versus rain teams and rare threats such as SubCM Keldeo, but neither of these are common enough to usually justify running it in isolation. It also lets Jellicent block Flip Turn from Swampert. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Jellicent can reliably switch into Pokemon like Cobalion, no matter the entry hazards situation. Colbur Berry is an option if one is confident in their team's hazard removal, letting Jellicent better check Swords Dance + Knock Off Scizor, check Conkeldurr to a degree, and freely stay in on Hydreigon once. 200 Speed EVs let Jellicent outspeed Azumarill, Skarmory, and Conkeldurr, while the remaining EVs beyond HP improve Jellicent's Defense for threats such as Scizor and Cobalion.</p> <p>Jellicent fits best on stall teams, which appreciate its defensive utility versus threats such as Cobalion and Scizor and wallbreaking versus opposing bulky teams, and these teams provide it plenty of cleric, entry hazard, and status support. It can, however, also fit on certain balance teams that appreciate a reliable check to Cobalion and Keldeo. Cleric support from Articuno or Chansey helps greatly on stall, as Jellicent is prone to Sludge Bomb poisoning from Pokemon such as Galarian Slowbro and Amoonguss, and it lets Jellicent be more aggressive against Toxic users such as Hippowdon. Articuno can also dominate the entry hazards war with its Pressure + Defog combination, letting Jellicent consider running Colbur Berry instead of Heavy-Duty Boots. Entry hazard setters like Hippowdon, Chansey, and Skarmory can make the most of Jellicent's wallbreaking potential. Hippowdon can help check Raikou, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-H for Jellicent, while Skarmory can cover Grass-types such as Zarude and Amoonguss, and it helps versus Excadrill, which Jellicent can struggle to spinblock against. Chansey offers a reliable Primarina and Hydreigon answer, and having Hippowdon set Stealth Rock lets it fit the aforementioned Heal Bell. Wish support from Umbreon can massively help Jellicent reliably stay at high HP. Jellicent also traditionally checks some of the main Umbreon switch-ins, such as Cobalion. Umbreon solidly answers Pokemon such as Hydreigon that check Jellicent, handles Pokemon Jellicent struggles to reliably check like Mamoswine and Salamence, and has Toxic to support Hex in return. On balance teams, Toxic spreaders include Salamence, Hippowdon, and Excadrill. Setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro and Slowking appreciate Jellicent softening up the opposing team so they can clean late-game. Slowking, in particular, offers a more reliable check to Pokemon such as Mamoswine with its superior bulk and Regenerator, while Galarian Slowbro can support Jellicent mid-game by spreading status with Sludge Bomb and Scald. On balance teams, checks to Zarude and Amoonguss are especially useful, such as Swords Dance Cobalion, which appreciates Jellicent pressuring or wearing down checks such as Hippowdon and Salamence. Skarmory can also fill this role well on stall teams, with its Spikes support being very valuable to these balance teams too.</p>"

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>Chandelure's amazing Special Attack stat, threatening STAB combination, and wide utility movepool make it a strong offensive presence capable of getting past most of its checks. Hex Chandelure is notable for burdening switch-ins like Hydreigon and Hippowdon with delibirating status, allowing it to overcome them while still utilizing its dangerous STAB combination to threaten many teams. Meanwhile, Choice Specs is an excellent option for its immediate wallbreaking prowess and ability to utilize utility moves like Sleep Talk and Trick. Chandelure's typing also offers a few defensive benefits, letting it soft check popular Pokemon like Celesteela and Amoonguss. Unfortunately, Chandelure's rather average Speed and common weaknesses allow UU's many faster threats, including Keldeo, Hydreigon, and Nihilego, to easily overwhelm it. Moreover, it is weak to Stealth Rock, which can significantly damage its longevity on sets that aren't running Heavy-Duty Boots. Hex sets can lack immediate firepower, leaving Chandelure reliant on teammates for entry into the field.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind is a decent option for a set, taking advantage of defensive foes like Chansey to find setup opportunities. However, Chandelure's other sets are more immediately powerful, which is often more valuable for it. Energy Ball is a situational option for powering through various Pokemon, like Primarina and Hippowdon, but Chandelure can still hit all the aforementioned targets hard with its Ghost-type moves. Choice Scarf Chandelure is a viable revenge killer with its potent offensive typing, even still having the option of crippling defensive checks with Trick, though it notably lacks power and is usually only standout on sun teams. Memento allows Chandelure to grab momentum for its team after it's been weakened while potentially positioning a teammate to sweep. This is rather situational and gives up better utility, though, usually only working well on Choice item sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Several Water-types can often find ways to give Chandelure trouble. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can apply serious pressure with their powerful STAB Aqua Jet. Keldeo outspeeds and OHKOes Chandelure. Primarina can take any hit from full health and power through Chandelure with its Water-type STAB moves. Tentacruel can be particularly annoying, tanking attacks with its good special bulk and checking the Hex set well thanks to its Toxic immunity.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Krookodile and Zarude often struggle to reliably switch in, but they can outspeed Chandelure and pick it off with super effective STAB moves. Hydreigon walls Chandelure's STAB combination and can OHKO it, although its common sets do not utilize Roost, leaving it subject to being overwhelmed. Mandibuzz can switch into Shadow Ball and scare Chandelure out, but it takes massive damage from Fire Blast and risks getting OHKOed by Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Faster threats</strong>: Chandelure's rather average Speed leaves it vulnerable to most faster Pokemon, such as Zygarde-10%, Excadrill, Lycanroc-D, and Choice Scarf Diggersby, which can smack it with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Various specially bulky Pokemon can tank hits from Chandelure and cripple it in return. Chansey doesn't risk major damage from any attack, but it needs to look out for Trick or Taunt on the switch; Taunt leaves it completely unable to touch Chandelure. Nihilego can always take at least one Shadow Ball from full and pressure Chandelure with a super effective STAB moves. It's a particularly strong check to the Hex set, bearing an immunity to Toxic and taking minimal damage from Fire-type moves. Hippowdon doesn't like to switch into Chandelure but it can tank any hit and KO it back with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hex": {
        "description": "<p>Flamethrower is a reliable STAB move to threaten common Pokemon like Scizor, Tangrowth, and Skarmory. Hex severely damages foes that Chandelure hits with Toxic. However, it should be noted that it isn't too powerful on non-statused foes, which can require careful play. Toxic burdens potential switch-ins like Hippowdon, Hydreigon, and Primarina, putting them on a timer and allowing Chandelure to potentially whittle them down with Hex. Will-O-Wisp is an alternative option to cripple Toxic-immune foes like Nihilego, Crobat, and Galarian Slowbro, with threats like Hydreigon still hating status regardless. Protect allows Chandelure to rack up poison damage and can also scout Choice item users, such as Hydreigon and Keldeo. Taunt is an option over Protect, allowing Chandelure to pressure Chansey more effectively by blocking Chansey's recovery and Toxic, which boosts its stall matchup. However, Protect is often too valuable thanks to its stronger applications against offensive Pokemon. Heavy-Duty Boots significantly boosts this set's longevity and self-sufficiency. Flame Body allows Chandelure to pivot into and threaten a burn against foes like Jirachi and Celesteela. It can also let Chandelure cripple Pokemon that revenge kill it, like Knock Off Azelf, as it faints.</p> <p>Hex Chandelure fits best on bulky offense, balance, and semi-stall teams that appreciate Chandelure's ability to wear down defensive threats early- to mid-game. Chandelure can struggle to get a Toxic against foes like Slowking and Hippowdon at times, so defensive Celesteela is a great teammate that can cripple these threats with Toxic instead, especially luring in the former looking to switch in on Leech Seed. Cobalion, Hippowdown, and Nidoqueen can provide Stealth Rock support to whittle down checks like Hydreigon and Nihilego. They all handle Nihilego, which is a problem for Chandelure if not running Will-O-Wisp. Cobalion also breaks past Chansey and Umbreon and switches into Scizor's Knock Off. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Zarude, and Choice Scarf Diggersby can all bring in Chandelure against bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Rotom-W and Zarude take on Primarina and Hippowdon as well, while Diggersby revenge kills Nihilego with ease. Amoonguss defensively checks Primarina and Keldeo and can provide paralysis with Stun Spore to hinder foes like Noivern. Umbreon's typing synergizes well with Chandelure's and can provide Wish support to keep Chandelure and the rest of the team healthy. Late-game cleaners like Azelf, Nasty Plot Togekiss, and Calm Mind Primarina all enjoy Chandelure wearing down the enemy team's defensive core, limiting threats like Hydreigon in return. Other status spreaders can work well as teammates, alleviating Chandelure's need for prediction regarding Hex. Galarian Slowbro is particularly good at spreading status due to its tendency to run both Scald and Sludge Bomb. Tentacruel does this as well and can also utilize Knock Off to further cripple foes.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Fire Blast is an immensely powerful STAB move that can significantly damage even resisted foes, threatening to 2HKO Hydreigon and Keldeo, while outright annihilating common defensive walls like Hippowdon, Tangrowth, and Celesteela. Overheat is an option to nearly OHKO defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Hippowdon, but its Special Attack drop makes Fire Blast more spammable. Shadow Ball is a reliable STAB attack to wipe out Fire-resistant Pokemon like Slowking, Salamence, and Nihilego. Flamethrower is strong and accurate, preventing foes like Scizor and Tangrowth from utilizing a lucky Fire Blast miss to cripple Chandelure. Sleep Talk lets Chandelure act as a sleep absorber for its team, pivoting in on Amoonguss's Spore without being entirely crippled. Trick is another option in the fourth moveslot, however, to cripple defensive switch-ins like Chansey. Flame Body is preferred to potentially punish physical attackers such as Crobat and Scizor. Flash Fire is an option to let Chandelure pivot in on Fire-type attacks from foes like Moltres and Salamence, boosting its damage output. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed Adamant Gyarados and Mamoswine as well as Modest Nidoking, but Modest can be an option for increased damage output, being able to OHKO Hippowdon with Overheat after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on offense teams for the massive wallbreaking prowess it offers. Chandelure requires extensive support in entry hazard removal to offset its Stealth Rock vulnerability. Excadrill and Salamence can form a double entry hazard removal core for Chandelure, keeping Stealth Rock and Spikes off against common setters like Nihilego, Hippowdon, and Skarmory together. Salamence can also check faster threats like Zarude and Keldeo for Chandelure. Chandelure appreciates entry hazard support for furthering damage on foes alongside its attacks; Swampert and the aforementioned Excadrill are solid choices, additionally pivoting in on foes that can revenge kill it like Lycanroc-D and Thundurus-T. Rotom-W is a particularly strong teammate for Chandelure, as it can lure in Grass-types like Amoonguss and pivot Chandelure into them with Volt Switch while also making use of Defog. Zarude is another strong partner, pressuring foes like Primarina and Nihilego for Chandelure and bringing it in against Pokemon like Scizor and Amoonguss. Azelf outspeed and KOes faster threats like Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and Cobalion. Swords Dance Scizor and Cobalion appreciates Chandelure's early-game wallbreaking and can break past specially defensive Pokemon like Nihilego and Chansey in return.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Haxorus is an appealing sweeper on paper; it has a serviceable Speed tier that beats Excadrill and Rotom-W, coverage in Poison Jab and Close Combat to hit checks like Primarina, Togekiss, and Celesteela, and a Double Dance strategy through Swords Dance + Scale Shot. Unfortunately, Haxorus faces multiple issues that severely limit it within UU. Scale Shot is a very unreliable STAB move that can fall flat on damage and lacks the power to threaten common defensive staples such as Amoonguss and Hippowdon. Defense drops from Scale Shot and Close Combat make Haxorus much easier to revenge kill with priority such as Bullet Punch. Haxorus also finds itself reliant on Life Orb to do necessary amounts of damage, which only worsens its longevity issues stemming from its lack of bulk, resistances, and safe setup opportunities. It can therefore struggle to enact Double Dance and finds itself pressured a lot by faster threats like Nihilego and Hydreigon. It's typically outclassed on its theoretical hyper offense teams by other setup sweepers like Salamence and Gyarados, which have better bulk, types, and moves.</p>",
    "sets": {"Swords Dance": {"description": "<p>Swords Dance and Scale Shot let Haxorus boost both Attack and Speed. This combination is used over Dragon Dance to keep Haxorus from having to lock itself into outrage while also giving it a better dragon move than Dragon Claw. Close Combat covers threatening Steel-type Pokemon like Excadrill, Skarmory, Celesteela, and Scizor, though the latter three can take an unboosted hit and threaten Haxorus back, and Skarmory even takes a +2 hit. It is also Haxorus's best move against Hippowdon. +2 Poison Jab wipes out Fairy-types like Primarina and Togekiss. Life Orb gives Haxorus a chance to OHKO Celesteela and Scizor at +2 with Close Combat. Lum Berry is an option that lets Haxorus safely set up against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Chansey without fear of status. While Haxorus is threatening on paper, its ability to sweep is easier said than done, as it has few opportunities to set up without taking a debilitating hit in the process.</p>"}},

It is also a decent Defogger with solid matchups against entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and Jirachi. Mandibuzz's relatively high Speed for a defensive Pokemon lets it get the jump on slower wallbreakers such as Primarina without investing too much into its Speed. However, its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots leaves it with a crippling weakness to Knock Off from Pokemon that Mandibuzz tries to pivot into such as Scizor and Tangrowth. If it loses its item, Mandibuzz easily gets overwhelmed, as it often has to deal with numerous threats and is forced to use Roost often. Mandibuzz's typing also leaves it weak to common threats such as Nihilego, Thundurus-T, Azumarill, and Primarina.</p>",

Whirlwind phazes out threats Mandibuzz cannot handle like Primarina and Cobalion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Primarina can force Mandibuzz out, as it can nail it with Moonblast or set up a Substitute for free.

Defog can also be used due to its good matchup against certain entry hazard setters such as Excadrill and Jirachi, but Mandibuzz can't beat other setters like Nihilego or Hippowdon, and struggles longer term versus Skarmory, especially Toxic variants, so it should only be run if absolutely necessary. Taunt can shut down defensive Pokemon such as Chansey and Celesteela that rely on passive damage to break through Mandibuzz, and prevent Skarmory from setting Spikes up against it as well as Toxic from Hippowdon. Brave Bird lets it hit Conkeldurr, Tapu Bulu, and Keldeo super effectively. U-turn lets Mandibuzz pivot out of unfavorable matchups such as Nihilego and Nidoking and bring in a teammate that can threaten them.

It also possesses other good attacks like Rock Slide to hit Salamence and Rotom-H, Superpower to KO Cobalion, and Iron Head to better threaten the likes of Nihilego, Mamoswine, and Hatterene.

Besides those two providing utility options like pivoting, Knock Off, and Stealth Rock, both have much better defensive presences. In practice, Durant fails to come in safely and efficiently wallbreak, since it has poor bulk and can't significantly damage common Pokemon like Rotom-W and Slowking after it uses First Impression. It is also easily worn down through Life Orb recoil, Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory and Amoonguss, and entry hazards. Hustle also makes Durant incredibly inconsistent as a wallbreaker, and since it is incredibly frail, it is likely to be KOed in the same turn after missing a move.</p>",

Iron Head is needed to threaten the likes of Nihilego and Hatterene and attain solid neutral coverage versus Hippowdon and Primarina. Rock Slide hits Fire- and Flying-types like Rotom-H, Salamence, Moltres, and Crobat. Salamence, however, isn't OHKOed by Rock Slide due to Intimidate, and it can KO back with Flamethrower or Hurricane.

    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon is a devastatingly powerful wallbreaker in UU due to its incredible Special Attack, great movepool, and excellent STAB combination. Its Choice Specs set has no reliable switch-ins apart from Primarina and Chansey, ripping apart common defensive staples like Amoonguss, Scizor, and Hippowdon. Hydreigon also can utilize a Choice Scarf set to revenge kill setup sweepers and fast threats, like Gyarados, Zygarde-10%, and Azelf, while also having a fast U-turn to escape unfavorable matchups and potentially Defog to compress entry hazard removal. Hydreigon's decent defensive typing alongside recovery in Roost lets it naturally check threats like Slowking, Rotom-W, and Chandelure. However, Choice Specs Hydreigon has an exploitable Speed tier, falling short of staples like Salamence, Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Cobalion, which allows it to be revenge killed rather easily. On the other hand, the Choice Scarf set lacks the outright power to get past Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Celesteela, and it also can get heavily punished for locking into any move, with more offensive teams outright using it as setup bait. The presence of Fairy-types that are neutral to Flash Cannon like Primarina and Azumarill means Hydreigon can struggle to click a nuclear Draco Meteor when they're on the enemy team. Moreover, it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it has to choose between Flamethrower to cook Celesteela, Cobalion, and bulky Scizor or Flash Cannon to keep the aforementioned Fairy-types and Togekiss from blanking it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydreigon can use an offensive Roost set on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its defensive utility in addition to powerful wallbreaking. Taunt is common on this set to block entry hazards from the likes of Hippowdon and Chansey as well as to disrupt stall teams by shutting down threats like Umbreon and Chansey. Nasty Plot can be used to turn Hydreigon into a ferocious wallbreaker that can get many setup chances alongside Roost. With a boost, it can easily break past Pokemon that would normally switch into it like Celesteela, Mandibuzz, and Hippowdon using its STAB moves. However, this set thuds into Primarina and gets revenge killed easily. Shock Wave on the Choice Specs set is an option to keep Primarina from walling Hydreigon, cleanly 2HKOing most variants. Belch + Salac Berry + Nasty Plot + Substitute can be used to boost Hydreigon's Speed and OHKO Primarina and Azumarill after a Nasty Plot with Belch, but this set is unreliable because it will often not activate the Berry, rendering Belch useless. Thunder Wave can cripple switch-ins like Nihilego and Cobalion on more utility-based sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Primarina is unthreatened by any of Hydreigon's attacks and threatens an OHKO with Moonblast. Azumarill has less bulk and gets worn down by Flash Cannon over time, but it discourages locking into a STAB move in the short term. Togekiss and Hatterene also discourage Draco Meteor but get hit hard by Flash Cannon, and the latter cannot switch into Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Cobalion and Keldeo outspeed and OHKO Hydreigon.

It also blanks Celesteela and can use Knock Off to remove Eviolite from Chansey. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth also check Azumarill and Primarina for Hydreigon. Primarina and the aforementioned Amoonguss can check dangerous Fighting-types like Keldeo and Conkeldurr. Pivots like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Moltres can safely bring in Hydreigon against their answers like Amoonguss and Rotom-H. The former two also can threaten Primarina and Azumarill. Furthermore, slow pivots like Slowking and Chansey check revenge killers to Hydreigon like Keldeo, Salamence, and Azelf and get Hydreigon in especially safely against Skarmory and Tangrowth. Crobat and Choice Scarf Diggersby are also excellent partners for Hydreigon, revenge killing faster threats like Keldeo and Azelf. Both lure in Skarmory for Hydreigon; the former also compresses entry hazard removal and answers Conkeldurr, while the latter can bring Hydreigon in on Amoonguss and Tangrowth and threaten specially defensive walls like Chansey and Primarina. Entry hazard support from allies like Skarmory, Nihilego, and Hippowdon helps Hydreigon break past the likes of opposing Nihilego and Celesteela more easily, with even Chansey being overwhelmed with Spikes on the field. Nihilego also can use Knock Off to remove items from Celesteela and Chansey. Scizor and Cobalion are able to pressure specially defensive walls like Chansey, Nihilego, and Umbreon for Hydreigon. Late-game cleaners like the aforementioned Scizor, Zygarde-10%, and Gyarados can finish off weakened walls like Celesteela and Nihilego after Hydreigon breaks holes in the enemy team.</p>"

        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Hydreigon can revenge kill faster threats like Azelf, Zygarde-10%, and Keldeo, as well as setup sweepers like Gyarados, with its STAB moves. U-turn lets Hydreigon pivot away from Chansey and Primarina and bring in a teammate to handle them. Fire Blast OHKOes Steel-types like Scizor, Cobalion, and Excadrill and 2HKOes Assault Vest Tangrowth. Alternatively, Defog allows Hydreigon to compress emergency entry hazard removal. Roost lets Hydreigon utilize its typing to switch into Chandelure, Rotom-W, and Slowking and heal as it forces them out, though both it and Defog are troublesome to lock into. Roost is also is useful if Hydreigon chooses to take a Knock Off in a game where Choice Scarf is no longer needed. Earth Power can be used to hit Nihilego hard if the team needs the insurance, but it fails to OHKO without chip damage and lacks any other meaningful targets that a STAB move or Fire Blast cannot cover. A Modest nature can be used for more power at the cost of not outspeeding +1 Excadrill, +2 Cloyster, and Choice Scarf Darmanitan.</p> <p>Hydreigon best fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate the role compression of revenge killer, Ghost-resistant piece, and potential entry hazard remover in one Pokemon. Tentacruel, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss check Fairy-types like Primarina and Azumarill for Hydreigon; Tentacruel also can hinder Celesteela with Knock Off, and Liquid Ooze keeps it from clicking Leech Seed. Entry hazard removal from the aforementioned Tentacruel and Excadrill is needed to offset the chip damage from Stealth Rock that Hydreigon accumulates from frequent pivoting. They also free up the Defog moveslot on Hydreigon for another option like Roost. Entry hazard support from Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Excadrill can wear down threats like Gyarados, Nihilego, Keldeo, and Assault Vest Tangrowth for Hydreigon to get past. Nidoqueen also pressures Fairy-types like Hatterene and Primarina. Bulky Swords Dance Scizor beats checks to Hydreigon like Nihilego and Chansey and can clean late-game with certain faster threats like Thundurus-T and Salamence removed. Wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Keldeo appreciate Hydreigon revenge killing threats to them such as Starmie, Azelf, and Zygarde-10%. In return, they pressure Chansey and Nihilego and soften up Celesteela. Pivots like Rotom-H, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T form VoltTurn cores with Hydreigon, with each wearing down each other's checks.</p>"

  "Cobalion": {
    "overview": "<p>Cobalion's flexibility and utility make it one of the best role compression options on bulky offense and balance teams. Its typing and ability Justified give it many openings against Pokemon such as Scizor, Zarude, non-Stun Spore Amoonguss, and Nihilego to reliably boost with Swords Dance or set Stealth Rock. This also helps Cobalion punish Choice-locked Zygarde-10% and Diggersby for using Outrage and Body Slam. Its quadruple resistance to Stealth Rock makes Cobalion incredibly difficult to wear down without other forms of residual damage, and its ability to exploit Pokemon such as the aforementioned Scizor and Zarude makes Cobalion an excellent user of Swords Dance. After a boost, coverage options like Stone Edge and Megahorn have limited switch-ins and can eliminate checks like Moltres, Gyarados, and Slowking, though the lack of perfect accuracy can make them somewhat unreliable. Cobalion also boasts some useful utility options such as Stealth Rock to chip down switch-ins, Toxic for crippling checks like Hippowdon and Salamence, and Volt Switch to gain momentum off checks like Galarian Slowbro. Cobalion's Speed tier also helps it offensively check dangerous Pokemon like Hydreigon, Nihilego, and Thundurus-T. However, its mediocre base 90 Attack means it's dependent on Swords Dance to be threatening, and teams with good Cobalion counterplay like Hippowdon and Galarian Slowbro can prevent it from setting up in front of desirable targets such as Scizor and Zarude. Non-Swords Dance Cobalion sets struggle to reliably break through Scizor and must be paired with other methods of checking it. Cobalion's Speed tier, while impressive, still leaves it vulnerable to common offensive Pokemon such as Azelf and Zygarde-10%. Cobalion's subpar Special Defense also means it can have trouble facing bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Slowking and leaves Cobalion to take notable damage from even resisted special moves like Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Vanilluxe's Blizzard. Lastly, Cobalion's neutrality to Fairy, Flying, and Psychic hinders its role as a Steel-type against foes like Togekiss and Hatterene, which can strain teambuilding.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Magnet Rise or Air Balloon alongside Swords Dance turns Excadrill and Hippowdon into complete setup fodder for a potential sweep, but this is matchup dependent. On hyper offense, Life Orb is useful for increasing Cobalion's wallbreaking capabilities enough to OHKO Slowking and Tangrowth with +2 Megahorn and Thundurus-T with an unboosted Stone Edge. Weakness Policy + Rock Polish on a three attacks set is an alternative option that takes advantage of Cobalion's good bulk and weak super effective hits like Hippowdon's Earthquake and bulky Salamence's Flamethrower to gain a staggering boost. Rock Polish is recommended to sweep teams since it avoids revenge killers like Azelf and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Substitute + Swords Dance sets with STAB attacks take huge advantage of Pokemon that Cobalion forces out, like Scizor and Zarude. Thunder Wave is able to help cripple switch-ins like Skarmory and Noivern to make them easier to overwhelm, but it is useless against other threats like Hippowdon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: With Roost, Salamence and Noivern prey on Cobalion's low Special Defense with Flamethrower and can act as long-term checks, with the former also having Intimidate and the latter boasting more Speed and breaking power; both of them have to be cautious of Stone Edge and Toxic, though. Skarmory is a standout threat because Iron Defense helps it maintain a strong matchup against Swords Dance sets and Spikes greatly cuts into Cobalion's ability to pivot; however Skarmory also has to worry about becoming free momentum against Volt Switch. Thundurus-T can't repeatedly switch into Cobalion but threatens it out and can stop Swords Dance sweeps, especially against versus Iron Head variants.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Galarian Slowbro is one of Cobalion's worst matchups thanks to the longevity of Regenerator + Slack Off, its coverage in Flamethrower, and its ability to punish non-Swords Dance sets with Calm Mind. Amoonguss is problematic because it can put Cobalion out of commission with Spore or Stun Spore, though it needs to be careful of becoming setup fodder if something else was put to sleep or if Cobalion has Safety Goggles. Other notable threats are Earth Power Nidoqueen and Rapid Spin Tentacruel, which are bulky enough to break through Cobalion or clear its Stealth Rock, respectively. However, Nidoqueen faces the problem of being unable to reliably handle Swords Dance variants after a boost and can suffer from Iron Head flinches.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Primarina and Slowking prey on Cobalion's low Special Defense with the threat of considerable damage and a potential burn with Scald. Regenerator + Teleport Slowking is especially problematic for its ability to use Cobalion for easy momentum, but it drops to +2 Megahorn. Keldeo can threaten an OHKO with Secret Sword, and Gyarados can use Cobalion lacking super effective coverage as setup fodder with Dragon Dance. Jellicent, though uncommon, can be a very strong check to Swords Dance sets with its resistance to both of Cobalion's STAB attacks, but it needs to be wary of utility sets, which can pivot with Volt Switch or land a crippling Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon and Swampert have the bulk to comfortably withstand Cobalion's attacks and retaliate with their own, but neither appreciates Toxic. Choice Scarf Diggersby and Zygarde-10% easily revenge kill Cobalion but can be lured in and KOed by Shuca Berry sets.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Moltres and Chandelure are resistant to Cobalion's STAB moves and can incinerate it with their own; however, they risk being KOed by Stone Edge. Pokemon such as Azelf and Choice Scarf Hydreigon outspeed Cobalion and severely damage it with Fire Blast.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Cobalion's great resistances and bulk give it many opportunities to set up in front of foes like Scizor, Zarude, Nihilego, and Mandibuzz. After a boost, Close Combat threatens to 2HKO the previously mentioned targets and OHKO other threats like Rotom-W after Stealth Rock. Megahorn provides valuable coverage against Slowking and Tangrowth, notably OHKOing the former after a boost and minimal chip. Stone Edge slams checks such as Salamence and Moltres and improves Cobalion's matchup against Thundurus-T. Alternatively, Iron Head gives Cobalion a better matchup against Hatterene and Primarina, prevents Nidoqueen from walling it, and lets Cobalion potentially overwhelm checks like Hippowdon and Galarian Slowbro through flinches. Leftovers increases its longevity, giving it more chances to set up. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to punish Zarude and Scizor for using U-turn. It also provides chip damage against Choice-locked threats like Body Slam Diggersby and Outrage Zygarde-10%. Shuca Berry can be run to Cobalion beat Hippowdon and prevents it from being revenge killed by Zygarde-10%'s Thousand Arrows. However, this should only be used if the team does not have other options to overwhelm Hippowdon or deal with Zygarde-10% reliably. Safety Goggles is also an option that allows Cobalion to turn Amoonguss into setup fodder, but this should only be used in the absence of any teammates that can handle Amoonguss.</p> <p>Cobalion fits best on bulky offense and balance teams for its ability to punish Scizor and Zarude while threatening to wallbreak or clean up the opposition. Other entry hazard setters such as Nihilego and Hippowdon provide chip damage for Amoonguss and Celesteela. They also help check problematic foes such as Galarian Slowbro, Salamence, and Zygarde-10%. Pivots such as Azelf and Thundurus-T help Cobalion find setup opportunities against Pokemon like Chansey and Nihilego. They also help in overwhelming other checks like Primarina and Hippowdon with their coverage moves. Skarmory's Spikes can be problematic to Cobalion's longevity, so entry hazard removers like Rotom-W and Salamence are appreciated. These options are also good teammates to have against foes like Conkeldurr. Teammates like Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth can pivot into dangerous foes like Keldeo and Primarina. Amoonguss also cripples Pokemon like opposing Cobalion and Galarian Slowbro with Spore, while Tangrowth removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Salamence and opposing Amoonguss with Knock Off. Cobalion is susceptible to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf Diggersby and Zygarde-10%, so other revenge killers like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Mamoswine are appreciated.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Cobalion's ability to last throughout a game makes it an effective user of Stealth Rock, chipping away at threats like Primarina while having options to overwhelm entry hazard removers like Salamence. Cobalion has many opportunities to set up hazards, as it forces out opposing entry hazard setters like Chansey, Nihilego, and Excadrill. Close Combat is necessary for removing Excadrill and weakened Pokemon like Rotom-W. Iron Head maintains offensive pressure on the likes of Nidoqueen, Togekiss, and Hatterene; it is especially important to prevent Hatterene from denying Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. If you're using Iron Head, Swords Dance should be the fourth moveslot to prevent Cobalion from getting countered by bulky Scizor and give it enough offensive presence to overwhelm Amoonguss and Hippowdon more easily. Swords Dance also leaves Cobalion less vulnerable to Celesteela and Nidoqueen switching in. Toxic can be used over Iron Head to cripple Salamence, Slowking, Tangrowth, and Hippowdon, preventing them from checking Cobalion in the long run and winning the entry hazard war against the former. This also opens up teammates like Zygarde-10% to more effectively work as late-game cleaners. Volt Switch is used alongside Toxic to hit targets Cobalion cannot poison, like Skarmory, Amoonguss, and Scizor, and pivot out of checks like Tangrowth and Primarina. However, this is less consistent against teams with Hippowdon. Stone Edge is an alternative over Iron Head with Swords Dance to deal with Moltres and Salamence; however, Iron Head's value against foes like Hatterene is generally preferred to help with setting Stealth Rock. Taunt can deny Hippowdon looking to heal in front of Cobalion with Slack Off as well as prevent Scizor from boosting with Swords Dance. It can also be an emergency way of preventing Salamence from removing entry hazards with Defog. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, as this set doesn't really need to maintain its health for wallbreaking and cleaning, and it improves Cobalion's role as a countermeasure against Zarude and Scizor. However, Leftovers can still be used to improve Cobalion's longevity against foes like Nihilego. Cobalion usually runs maximum Attack investment to gain more value from its STAB moves, but a spread using 160 HP EVs with 96 Attack EVs is possible with Volt Switch + Toxic variants. This helps Cobalion play a more defensive role: it can pivot into Vanilluxe and Choice Scarf Hydreigon's STAB moves more comfortably while still OHKOing Pokemon like Mamoswine and Excadrill with Close Combat.</p> <p>Utility Cobalion similarly fits in balance and bulky offense teams but takes a more defensive approach as a Stealth Rock setter or disrupter. Cobalion taking up the role of a Stealth Rock setter means that there's more room for an offensive Ground-type teammate. Some examples are Zygarde-10% and Diggersby, which appreciate Cobalion's ability to overwhelm Scizor and cripple shared checks like Hippowdon and Salamence with Toxic, opening an opportunity for them to clean. Skarmory's Spikes pairs excellently with Cobalion's Stealth Rock, severely wearing down foes like Keldeo, Hippowdon, and Nidoqueen. Furthermore, Swords Dance variants of Cobalion check Scizor well enough for Skarmory to run Toxic to weaken Salamence, preventing it from functioning as long-term entry hazard removal. Alternatively, Iron Defense Skarmory can act as a dedicated answer to Scizor, leaving room for Cobalion to run Taunt and block opposing entry hazards and Defog. Galarian Slowbro is a Calm Mind user that can break apart foes that Cobalion has issues with, like Skarmory. In return, Cobalion acts as an offensive check to foes like Hydreigon and Zarude. Colbur Berry + Flamethrower Galarian Slowbro also acts as a good primary Scizor answer. Crobat and Salamence are great answers to threats like Conkeldurr and Keldeo. Notably, Crobat makes overwhelming Hippowdon and Salamence easier with Taunt while revenge killing threats like Azelf and Noivern. Other Steel-types like Celesteela compensate for Cobalion's neutrality to Fairy and Flying, notably useful against Pokemon like Togekiss and Salamence. Celesteela also greatly assists in checking revenge killers like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Diggersby.</p>"

  "Tornadus": {
    "overview": "<p>Tornadus is a niche offensive pivot able to threaten a wide variety of Pokemon with its strong Acrobatics and coverage moves in Knock Off and Heat Wave. It outspeeds common Pokemon like Keldeo, Zarude, and Cobalion, and it can pivot out on them effectively or inconvenience switch-ins like Salamence and Rotom-W with Knock Off. With Defiant, it can punish Defog attempts from the likes of Salamence and Mandibuzz, as well as Intimidate from the former, exerting offensive pressure with ease and finding a strong place on entry hazard-stacking teams. Choice Specs Tornadus is also an incredibly dangerous wallbreaker on rain teams, getting a near-guaranteed teamslot on them with its 100% accurate Hurricane, which blows past most walls. Neither Tornadus set can afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots, however, meaning that it requires solid entry hazard removal to function decently. The physical set also struggles to break through Pokemon like Celesteela and Rotom-W early-game, meaning Tornadus's wallbreaking can be heavily limited, as it struggles to freely use Acrobatics on top of struggling to switch in due to its frailty. Tornadus's extreme frailty means that it is often forced out by faster threats like Azelf and Zygarde-10%, priority users like Scizor and Mamoswine, and bulky foes like Slowking and Celesteela that can take a hit and do massive damage in return.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On rain and non-rain teams, Tornadus can use a Nasty Plot set featuring Hurricane, Focus Blast, and Heat Wave or Weather Ball depending on the team to act as a dangerous setup sweeper with powerful attacks. However, Tornadus's fraility means it relies on setting up Nasty Plot against forced switches, making the immediate power of the Choice Specs set preferred on rain teams. Outside of rain teams, Tornadus can be rather inconsistent relying on Hurricane and Focus Blast as its primary attacks, making other special attackers like Azelf more appealing. Tornadus can use utility moves like Defog and Taunt with Prankster to help its teammates, but it has very little bulk and longevity to consistently pull off these moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Both Tornadus sets do not run Heavy-Duty Boots, meaning Tornadus can be worn down very easily by Stealth Rock and requires proper entry hazard removal to successfully operate as a wallbreaker.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-W and Rotom-H can comfortably switch into Tornadus's Flying-type STAB and force it out, but they get hit hard by Focus Blast or worn down by the combination of Knock Off + U-turn repeatedly. Raikou and Thundurus-T OHKO it with their Electric-type STAB moves, and the former even outspeeds it.</p> <p><strong>Faster threats and Priority</strong>: Faster threats like Azelf, Crobat, Zygarde-10%, Choice Scarf Diggersby, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon all take advantage of Tornadus's frailty to easily revenge kill it. Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine can easily OHKO Tornadus with their priority attacks, while other priority users such as Scizor and Azumarill can pick off a weakened Tornadus.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Chansey easily takes Tornadus's Choice Specs-boosted attacks and can cripple it with status or bring in an offensive check with Teleport. Nihilego is also a solid check to Tornadus's Choice Specs set, taking Hurricane with ease and limiting Tornadus's ability to repeatedly use it, but it fears Weather Ball in rain. However, both struggle to reliably check Tornadus's mixed offensive set, as it can cripple them with Knock Off and outlast them with U-turn + Acrobatics until they are in range of a KO. Celesteela similarly fares well against the Choice Specs set and has Leech Seed to regain lost health, though it still hates Knock Off removing its Leftovers albeit less than the other two. On the other hand, Hippowdon takes on the mixed offensive set well if lacking Grass Knot, but is unable to stand up to a Choice Specs-boosted Hurricane.</p>",

It also provides solid neutral coverage against defensive Pokemon like Salamence, Slowking, and Hatterene, with the former being heavily threatened due to Intimidate activating Defiant. U-turn lets Tornadus pivot out from unfavorable matchups like Rotom-W and Nihilego, bringing in wallbreakers or defensive checks to take advantage of them. It also wears down the aforementioned Pokemon and the likes of Excadrill and Celesteela, letting Tornadus pick them off later. Knock Off is crucial in making steady progress against Pokemon like Rotom-H, Primarina, and Nihilego, which rely on their items to maintain longevity, as well as removing Rocky Helmet from users like Hippowdon and Cobalion, preventing them from wearing down Tornadus as easily. Heat Wave allows Tornadus to dispatch the likes of Excadrill, Scizor, Cobalion, and Skarmory, which would otherwise check it well. Defiant is the preferred ability, as it allows Tornadus to heavily threaten Defoggers like Salamence and Mandibuzz, as well as punishing the former's Intimidate. This dissuades the use of Defog or the latter coming in against it. A Naive nature over Jolly keeps Heat Wave strong enough against threats like Excadrill. Also, Tornadus's bulk is poor enough that reducing it doesn't directly affect how it plays.</p> <p>Tornadus fits well on bulky offense and entry hazard-stacking teams in need of a fast, threatening pivot that can effectively deny entry hazard removal, as well as exerting the pressure needed to bring in wallbreakers safely. Consistent entry hazard removers like Rotom-W and Excadrill are greatly appreciated, as Tornadus needs Stealth Rock off the field. Late-game cleaners like Scizor and Nihilego can break through foes like Rotom-W, Slowking, and Hippowdon after Tornadus has sufficiently weakened them. Both also benefit from Tornadus baiting in the likes of Scizor, Excadrill, and Celesteela and weakening them via Heat Wave. Wallbreakers like Keldeo, Hydreigon, and Zygarde-10% can pressure the opposing team incredibly well; all of them also appreciate Tornadus threatening Tangrowth and Zarude, love Tornadus bringing them in safely via U-turn against Rotom-W and Celesteela, and appreciate its Knock Off support against foes like Tangrowth, Salamence, and Primarina. Rotom-W forms a potent VoltTurn core with Tornadus, as it pivots out on Pokemon like Zarude, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Chansey, all of which Tornadus can threaten or cripple with Knock Off. Zarude is another dangerous, complementary pivot and can check Nihilego, Rotom-W, and Hippowdon for Tornadus. Entry hazard setters like Cobalion, Nihilego, and Skarmory are often too good to pass up, since Tornadus often removes Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon like Salamence, Rotom-H, and Slowking, letting hazards and its U-turn rack up chip damage. Tornadus is also amazing at dissuading Defog attempts. Cobalion is able to check Scizor for Tornadus, and Nihilego can further pressure Celesteela and check Thundurus-T and Rotom-H. Skarmory is notable in that it provides Spikes, which bolsters Tornadus's damage output significantly. It can also pivot in on Mamoswine, which otherwise revenge kills Tornadus with ease. Defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth, Primarina, and Amoonguss can switch in on other common revenge killers like Raikou, Noivern, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Zygarde-10%.</p>"

Knock Off cripples switch-ins such as Chansey, Celesteela, and Nihilego, though it is undesirable to lock into because of how weak it is. U-turn allows Tornadus to pivot against switch-ins like Rotom-W, Celesteela, and Chansey. Focus Blast nails Flying-resists such as Rotom-W and Nihilego. It can even 2HKO Chansey if Eviolite is removed. Weather Ball is an option for super effective damage on Rotom-H and Nihilego in the rain. Choice Specs is required to obtain the aforementioned 2HKOes and maximizes Tornadus's wallbreaking potential.</p> <p>Choice Specs Tornadus primarily excels on rain teams. As such, Politoed is a mandatory teammate, being able to set rain and potentially punish Pokemon such as Rotom-W with a Scald burn. Secondary benefactors of rain are important in helping Tornadus wallbreak. Keldeo and Kingdra are excellent at overwhelming defensive cores with their overwhelming power and scaring out foes such as Nihilego and Rotom-H, with the latter being able to keep faster threats to Tornadus such as Zygarde-10%, Azelf, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon in line thanks to Swift Swim. Azumarill and Gyarados are able to break past specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Celesteela and enjoy Tornadus wiping out Grass-types like Tangrowth and Zarude. They also work with Tornadus to overwhelm Rotom-W. Excadrill provides entry hazard support and removal, being able to provide Stealth Rock to enhance Tornadus's wallbreaking while keeping it from getting worn down by Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin.

Thundurus-T's pivot set is able to wear down Pokemon like Salamence and Slowking and bring in teammates like Scizor, forming potent VoltTurn cores. Access to coverage options like Grass Knot, Knock Off, Focus Blast, and Psychic allows Thundurus-T to overcome counterplay like Swampert, Chansey, Excadrill, and Amoonguss, making it very difficult to scout its moveset. Thundurus-T also can utilize Nasty Plot to become a ferocious wallbreaker with no counters, being able to muscle past the sturdiest of specially defensive walls like Chansey and Assault Vest Tangrowth at +2 and crush balance teams. However, this set isn't too common in the metagame due to its average bulk, meaning it struggles to set up safely against common offensive teams. Even in matchups against bulkier teams, Thundurus-T usually gets inflicted with Toxic poison, allowing it to be played around easily. Because Thundurus-T's weakness to Stealth Rock mandates the use of Heavy-Duty Boots, it can't utilize boosting items like Life Orb to wallbreak easier. It also suffers from an exploitable Speed tier, leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed by common threats like Nihilego, Zarude, Keldeo, Azelf, and Zygarde-10%. It is also vulnerable to priority from slower threats like Mamoswine. Thundurus-T is often reliant on trading with threats like Salamence with its pivot set due to Volt Switch's low Base Power, making it more vulnerable to the aforementioned revenge killers. Even Pokemon like Amoonguss and Scizor can stay in and trade with the pivot set if needed. Thundurus-T, despite having the coverage moves to get past its checks, cannot fit all of them and has to choose between being checked by at least one of Chansey, Zarude, or Hippowdon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Defog can be used for emergency entry hazard removal, as Thundurus-T fares well against entry hazard setters like Skarmory, but this significantly hinders Thundurus-T's offensive potential due to it losing out on valuable coverage options.

        "description": "<p>Volt Switch allows Thundurus-T to make progress by pivoting while also being a strong STAB attack against the likes of Primarina and Celesteela. Alternatively, U-turn can act as a pivoting move alongside Thunderbolt to better pressure Salamence, Scizor, and Slowking. U-turn also has the benefit of not getting blocked by Ground-types like Hippowdon, but this causes Thundurus-T to struggle even more with fitting necessary coverage. Volt Switch can even be used alongside Thunderbolt if Thundurus-T doesn't need the extra coverage. Psychic is key for hitting Amoonguss, Conkeldurr, and Nihilego super effectively while also being a good midground against Pokemon like Tangrowth, Zygarde-10%, and opposing Thundurus-T. Grass Knot is mandatory to break past Hippowdon while also beating Swampert and Quagsire. Focus Blast OHKOes Excadrill, Hydreigon, and Mamoswine and prevents Zarude from switching in without fear. Knock Off cripples switch-ins like Chansey, Nihilego, and Assault Vest Tangrowth, allowing Thundurus-T and its teammates to overcome them in the long run. Sludge Bomb can be used over Psychic to hit Tapu Bulu and Assault Vest Tangrowth harder, letting a teammate like Zygarde-10% wallbreak easier. Similarly, Incinerate can be used over Psychic to OHKO Scizor while still hitting Grass-types like Amoonguss super effectively, but it and Sludge Bomb are typically harder to fit. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Thundurus-T to pivot throughout a game and not worry about taking Stealth Rock damage, making it very resilient. 4 Defense EVs allow Thundurus-T to always survive a Life Orb Ice Shard from Adamant Mamoswine from full.</p> <p>Pivot Thundurus-T best fits on VoltTurn and bulky offense teams that provide many partners that synergize with it well. Scizor is a phenomenal partner for Thundurus-T, revenge killing Nihilego and Zygarde-10% with Bullet Punch and punishing switch-ins to Thundurus-T like Tangrowth and Chansey. Other pivots like Zarude and Moltres form potent VoltTurn cores with Thundurus-T as well, bringing it in against Flying- and Water-types like Skarmory, Primarina, and Slowking. Zarude helps pressure Hippowdon and Nihilego, while Moltres can remove Grass-types like Tangrowth and Zarude. Slower pivots like Mandibuzz and Slowking also synergize well with Thundurus-T, having the added benefit of taking on revenge killers like Zygarde-10%, Azelf, and Mamoswine. Entry hazard setters like Cobalion and Swampert can set Stealth Rock to soften up checks like Nihilego and Chansey while also forming momentum cores and checking threats such as Zarude and Nihilego. Swords Dance Cobalion and Choice Scarf Diggersby pressure specially defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Nihilego, with the latter also revenge killing faster threats like Azelf and Zygarde-10%. Wallbreakers like Nidoking, Mamoswine, and Keldeo appreciate Thundurus-T bringing them in against Nihilego, Tangrowth, and Hippowdon. They also make up for the lack of initial power Thundurus-T can have at times.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot allows Thundurus-T to become one of the scariest wallbreakers in the tier, OHKOing or 2HKOing everything at +2. Thunderbolt OHKOes Salamence, Mandibuzz, Scizor, and Rotom-W after a boost. Psychic is key coverage for breaking past Nihilego and Amoonguss. +2 Focus Blast OHKOes Hydreigon and Excadrill and 2HKOes Chansey, Hippowdon, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Grass Knot is an alternative option over Focus Blast to apply more immediate pressure to Hippowdon at the cost of being able to break past Chansey. While Heavy-Duty Boots is typically run to avoid Stealth Rock chip damage, other items like Life Orb can be used on teams with solid entry hazard control for more wallbreaking power.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Thundurus-T best fits on hyper offense teams that provide it ample opportunities to sweep, though it can also work on bulky offense teams as a strong early- or late-game powerhouse. Leads like Excadrill, Krookodile, and Scolipede provide entry hazard support to weaken checks like Chansey and Swampert. Excadrill's Rapid Spin can also free up Thundurus-T to run another item over Heavy-Duty Boots. Ribombee can provide Sticky Web support to offset Thundurus-T's vulnerable Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed and KO typically faster threats like Keldeo and Nihilego. Late-game cleaners like Celesteela, Keldeo, and Scizor appreciate Thundurus-T's wallbreaking to clean easier. The former takes advantage of Thundurus-T wearing down Nihilego and luring in Zarude for free setup, while the latter two can force out Nihilego and Zygarde-10%. On bulky offense teams, pivots like Noivern and Zarude can bring in Thundurus-T against checks like Primarina and Skarmory for free setup.</p>"

  "Keldeo": {
    "overview": "<p>Keldeo's Hydro Pump is one of the most dangerous attacks in all of SS UU; any team not capable of stomaching it borders on unviable, and most teams will need to stack multiple Water-resistant Pokemon just to ensure they're safe against it. That, combined with Secret Sword to slice open Pokemon that withstand Hydro Pump like Zarude, Chansey, and Rotom-W, makes Keldeo one of the most dangerous wallbreakers in the tier. Its STAB moves give it plenty of coverage already, but Icy Wind further OHKOes Salamence and Noivern, which could otherwise handle it, and Air Slash 2HKOes every Grass-type in the tier. Keldeo can also utilize a Calm Mind set to act as a late-game cleaner on offensive teams. Keldeo's good Speed tier also lets it outspeed and threaten an OHKO on Pokemon like Zarude, Thundurus-T, and Nihilego, helping further separate it from other wallbreakers in the tier. This is further augmented by its resistance to common priority moves like Scizor's Bullet Punch and Mamoswine's Ice Shard. Keldeo does have some large issues, like generally struggling to break through Primarina, Slowking, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth without support—the latter three further exploit its Choice Specs to scout its attack through Regenerator—but its upside still makes it a top choice for a wallbreaker. Keldeo is also quite prediction reliant and can end up as setup fodder for the likes of Gyarados and Salamence if it's not careful. Finally, Keldeo's Speed tier, while good, can leave it easily revenge killed by the likes of Noivern, Crobat, Azelf, and Raikou.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Keldeo can run a pivot set with Leftovers and a moveset consisting of Scald, Secret Sword, Toxic, and Flip Turn. This makes it much better at wearing down Pokemon like Salamence, Slowking, Primarina, and Tangrowth, and it lets Keldeo pivot out on the likes of Amoonguss. Its damage output is mediocre, though, and Keldeo's Speed tier isn't amazingly suited to being a team's fast Pokemon that keeps other fast Pokemon in check, so it must be paired with a teammate like Noivern or Choice Scarf Diggersby. Substitute can be used over a coverage move on Keldeo's Calm Mind set to set up on threats like Amoonguss, but the presence of Assault Vest Tangrowth as well as the additional value Air Slash provides makes it not worth it most of the time. Choice Scarf sets with Flip Turn are a fine option if the ability to outspeed extremely fast Pokemon like boosted Salamence and Choice Scarf Zarude is absolutely necessary for a team to function, but Keldeo's unboosted damage output is somewhat disappointing and Flip Turn hits like a wet noodle off Keldeo's meager Attack stat, leaving it generally outclassed by other fast pivots like Noivern and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types, specifically those resistant to Secret Sword like Slowking and RestTalk Primarina, can switch into Keldeo all game long, as long as they keep themselves healthy. Tentacruel and Azumarill can switch into Keldeo once or twice and chip it or outright KO it, making it easier for teammates to handle. Starmie and Gyarados can offensively check Keldeo but must be careful about switching in, as it does a huge chunk of damage to them despite their resistances.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth and Amoonguss can scout any move Keldeo goes for. Even if they are weakened, Regenerator allows them to pivot out to an appropriate teammate to handle the scouted attack. Dhelmise and Tapu Bulu are niche answers that can switch into Keldeo somewhat well, though they despise being burnt by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Salamence and Noivern can switch into Keldeo very well, though Salamence needs some bulk investment to avoid a 2HKO from Hydro Pump, and Noivern must be cautious of Keldeo staying in as it heals itself with Roost, as Secret Sword can do massive damage when Roost sheds the Flying type . Hydreigon and Zygarde-10% can also offensively threaten Keldeo depending on what move it's locked into. All Dragon-types must be careful of Icy Wind, though.</p> <p><strong>Faster threats</strong>: Common threats like Raikou, Azelf, and Crobat all outspeed and threaten to KO Keldeo.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hydro Pump rinses the likes of Scizor, Hippowdon, Nihilego, and Thundurus-T. Even frailer resistant Pokemon such as Zarude and opposing Keldeo can't handle it more than once. Secret Sword smashes Chansey, Hydreigon, and Celesteela while chunking Tentacruel and offensive Primarina. Scald is useful against frailer offensive teams, where the extra power from Hydro Pump is unnecessary, letting Keldeo cleave through them without risk of missing. Scald also lets it fish for burns on checks like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Slowking, making them worse checks to Keldeo in the long run. Icy Wind destroys Salamence and Noivern, two Pokemon that could otherwise switch into Keldeo decently. It also hits Amoonguss and non-Assault Vest Tangrowth quite hard. Air Slash can KO Amoonguss from higher ranges than Icy Wind and 2HKOes Assault Vest Tangrowth with Stealth Rock up, but otherwise provides worse coverage.</p> <p>Keldeo's amazing wallbreaking good defensive utility let it fit on all kinds of offensive and balanced teams. Scizor is a phenomenal teammate that can switch into Grass-types that bother Keldeo like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Zarude. It can bring Keldeo in safely on the likes of Skarmory and Rotom-H to launch a free Hydro Pump. If running Swords Dance, Scizor can also sweep late-game after Keldeo has successfully broken down the opponent's team. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Nihilego, Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Excadrill makes it much more difficult for Pokemon like Slowking and Tangrowth to repeatedly switch into Keldeo. The former two can also check Salamence and Noivern for Keldeo, while the latter three can serve as decent checks to Raikou. Nidoqueen can also pressure Tangrowth and Primarina quite well. Fast pivots such as Noivern and Crobat can outspeed and threaten Pokemon that scare Keldeo out such as Azelf, Raikou, and Zygarde-10%, which is much appreciated. Both can also bring Keldeo in on targets that it freely preys upon, with Noivern baiting in Hippowdon and Nihilego and Crobat baiting in Scizor and Skarmory. Electric-types like Raikou, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T form good cores with Keldeo, as they can break down the likes of Slowking and Primarina for it. They can also check Togekiss, which can punish Keldeo locked into Secret Sword quite hard. Answers to Slowking, and thus the combination of Future Sight + Teleport, are mandatory when using Keldeo. Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Zarude can switch into Slowking safely and prevent it from using Teleport for free, breaking the FuturePort chain. Grass-types like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Zarude can aid in Keldeo's eternal fight against bulky Water-types while also being able to check the likes of Gyarados and Primarina.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind turns Keldeo into a scary late-game cleaner that hits Thundurus-T and Amoonguss harder and becomes difficult to revenge kill with the likes of Noivern and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Scald threatens switch-ins like Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Slowking with a burn while providing strong neutral damage against Skarmory and Scizor. Secret Sword breaks through Chansey, Zarude, Rotom-W, and Hydreigon. Air Slash hits Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth hard and allows Keldeo to possibly flinch down checks like Salamence and Slowking. Icy Wind can be used over Air Slash to OHKO on Salamence and still hit the aforementioned Grass-types hard after a Calm Mind boost, but it is weak otherwise and keeps Keldeo from meaningfully damaging Slowking. Leftovers gives Keldeo passive recovery to have more setup chances against the likes of Scizor and Mandibuzz and is also useful for offsetting Stealth Rock and sand damage. Life Orb is an option for increased wallbreaking power, able to OHKO Chansey with Secret Sword and Amoonguss with Air Slash after Stealth Rock with a boost, but causes Keldeo to get worn down quickly. Life Orb is solely used on hyper offense teams, as longevity is less needed.</p> <p>Calm Mind Keldeo best fits on bulky offense and balance teams as a strong late-game sweeper and is also valued on hyper offense teams for its good matchup against opposing offense. Entry hazard support is essential in softening up bulky Grass-types for Keldeo; Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Nidoqueen make excellent teammates as a result. Hippowdon also can bait Tangrowth and Slowking into taking Toxic and wear them down with sand damage. Meanwhile, Nidoqueen directly pressures Primarina for Keldeo. Pivots like Thundurus-T and Choice Scarf Diggersby pressure Slowking and Primarina throughout a game to keep them from switching into Keldeo without any care. They also wear down Amoonguss and Tangrowth with their repeated pivoting moves. Teammates such as Crobat, Noivern, and the aforementioned Diggersby can keep faster threats to Keldeo like Azelf and Starmie in line. Swords Dance Scizor, particularly Safety Goggles variants, takes advantage of Amoonguss and Tangrowth incredibly well, and can lure in and remove Salamence's item with Knock Off, allowing Keldeo to overwhelm it more easily with Air Slash. On hyper offense teams, Autotomize Celesteela and Nasty Plot Azelf take on Tangrowth and Amoonguss and overwhelm Primarina and Slowking for Keldeo, as they will often be the opposing team's main line of defense against these threats.</p>"

  "Diggersby": {
    "overview": "<p>Diggersby is one of the best revenge killers in UU due to its potent STAB combination backed by the deadly Huge Power. With a Choice Scarf, Diggersby can easily outspeed and KO common fast threats like Azelf, Cobalion, Crobat, and Zygarde-10%, as well as setup sweepers like Gyarados and Necrozma. U-turn indirectly enhances Diggersby's revenge killing capabilities, allowing it to pivot on Pokemon it cannot break through like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth and bring in powerful teammates that can take them on, like three attacks Primarina and Choice Specs Hydreigon. Moreover, Diggersby's resistance to Stealth Rock gives it many opportunities to wallbreak and pressure frail threats like Azelf throughout a game. Diggersby also can run a Swords Dance wallbreaker set to become nearly impossible to counter, OHKOing physical walls like Amoonguss, Celesteela, and Hippowdon at +2 while picking off faster threats like Thundurus-T and Keldeo with Quick Attack. However, Diggersby is quite prediction reliant, hating being locked into any move because common foes like Salamence, Skarmory, Scizor, and Cobalion are immune to Ground or resist Normal. Diggersby also offers next to zero defensive utility bar deterring Volt Switch from Thundurus-T and checking Nihilego in an emergency, as it is weak to common types like Grass, Fighting, and Water and frail. This poor defensive profile also limits setup opportunities for its Swords Dance set. Additionally, it gets worn down by Rocky Helmet from threats like Amoonguss, Skarmory, and Hippowdon. Choice Scarf Diggersby fails to revenge kill boosting sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence, and other Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon outspeed it. Diggersby is also very vulnerable to common priority attacks from Mamoswine, Conkeldurr, Scizor, and Azumarill, which can pick it off with slight chip damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band turns Diggersby into a devastating wallbreaker with immediate power, using its STAB combination to hit most of the tier for heavy damage while using coverage options in U-turn to wear down Rotom-W and Fire Punch to get past Skarmory and Celesteela. This set works exceptionally well on paralysis spam offense teams, which neuter faster threats like Salamence and Cobalion. However, this set is very slow and prediction reliant, being prey to top threats like Zarude and Keldeo, as well as to foes like Slowking and Hippowdon that are bulky enough to scout a hit. Agility + three Attacks offsets Diggersby's biggest issue in its base Speed, letting it outspeed and KO fast threats like Cobalion and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. However, like the Swords Dance set, Agility Diggersby has limited opportunities to reliably boost; it must rely on forcing out a chipped threat to get a setup chance. Its inability to boost its Attack also keeps it from breaking past Tangrowth and Hippowdon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority Moves</strong>: Choice Scarf Diggersby, while fast, still gets outpaced by other Choice Scarf users like Zarude and Hydreigon.

Even Choice Scarf Diggersby can fail to beat Cobalion if it is holding a Shuca Berry.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Rotom-W discourages Diggersby from firing off Earthquake and can KO it with Hydro Pump. Skarmory, Celesteela, Mandibuzz, and defensive Salamence can reliably take on Choice Scarf Diggersby, being unfazed by its attacks even in the long run thanks to their recovery and moves that threaten it back. However, all but Skarmory hate Knock Off.

Defensive Salamence takes almost 40% even after Intimidate from Body Slam. Additionally, the move's paralysis chance can badly hinder switch-ins like Cobalion and Scizor. U-turn gains momentum off of switch-ins like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Tangrowth. Knock Off removes Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Amoonguss, keeping Diggersby from getting worn down by attacking, as well as crippling otherwise great answers in Mandibuzz, Celesteela, and Salamence by removing their items. Alternatively, Fire Punch allows Diggersby to break past Celesteela and Tangrowth with good prediction and cleanly OHKO Scizor. Diggersby can run Spikes in the fourth moveslot thanks to it forcing switches against common foes like Nihilego, helping wear down threats like Hippowdon and Tangrowth, but being locked into the move creates opportunities for dangerous sweepers like Swords Dance Cobalion and Dragon Dance Gyarados. A Jolly nature is needed to outspeed Crobat and Adamant Dragon Dance Gyarados, threats Diggersby is tasked with revenge killing. However, Adamant can be used if Diggersby's team has insurance against those threats to KO foes like Keldeo more easily.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Diggersby best fits on VoltTurn, bulky offense, and balance teams that appreciate its revenge killing capabilities. Additional pivots like Zarude, Thundurus-T, and Slowking form potent momentum cores with Diggersby, bringing it into the likes of Cobalion, Nihilego, and opposing Zarude while threatening switch-ins to Diggersby like Hippowdon, Scizor, and Skarmory. Rotom-W is another exceptional pivot that can handle Mamoswine in addition to threats like Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Moltres. It can also use Defog to stop Spikes from wearing Diggersby down. Wallbreakers like Choice Specs Hydreigon and Keldeo pressure switch-ins to Diggersby like Mandibuzz, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. Body Slam's paralysis chance helps them deal with Salamence more easily and not risk getting outsped by Cobalion. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Nihilego and Cobalion can wear down Celesteela and Tangrowth for Diggersby. They both overwhelm Hippowdon and the aforementioned Celesteela too, with Nihilego also taking on common Ground-immune Pokemon like Salamence, Skarmory, and Moltres. Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can cover threatening Water-types like Keldeo, Rotom-W, and Primarina. Since Rocky Helmet damage is detrimental to Diggersby's longevity, Knock Off users like Scizor and the aforementioned Tangrowth are good to bait in Amoonguss, Skarmory, and Cobalion and remove their item.

Fire Punch allows Diggersby to break past Celesteela, Skarmory, and Tangrowth. Alternatively, Mega Kick is Diggersby's best option to hit Mandibuzz and punishes potential switch-ins like Rotom-W and Salamence. It still covers Tangrowth and even Celesteela, the latter being 2HKOed by it, but Diggersby misses out on breaking past Skarmory, and the move comes with shaky accuracy.

Sticky Web support from Ribombee can offset Diggersby's poor Speed, letting it pick off threats like Cobalion that would normally revenge kill it. Other sweepers like Nasty Plot Thundurus-T and Meteor Beam Nihilego can break past Pokemon like Celesteela, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-W that trouble Diggersby. They can also help overwhelm Hippowdon and keep threats that discourage setup, like Amoonguss, off the field. Autotomize Celesteela takes advantage of Diggersby drawing in Zarude and Skarmory, using them as setup bait, and it lures in Chansey for Diggersby to come in on, as Chansey is one of the few Pokemon Diggersby can reliably boost against. Azelf outspeeds and wipes out faster threats like Keldeo and Cobalion, appreciating Diggersby beating down Slowking and Mandibuzz to the point where Azelf can clean late-game. On more bulky offense teams, paralysis spreaders like Thunder Wave Togekiss and Stun Spore Amoonguss can be valuable to cripple offensive checks to Diggersby like Cobalion.

    "overview": "<p>The first thing that stands out about Noivern is its fantastic Speed tier; UU's congested Speed tiers have lots of threats between 331 and 361, and Noivern blazes past them with a blistering 379. Due to this, Noivern can gain momentum on the likes of Zarude, Cobalion, Azelf, Raikou, and Keldeo, a trait almost unique to it. Beyond that, Noivern's fantastic typing and great movepool give it great defensive utility and a powerful STAB Draco Meteor. With Flamethrower, Noivern has nearly unresisted coverage, which gives it an unparalleled ability to outspeed and bully offensive teams. Noivern's plentiful resistances and decent natural bulk let it check the likes of Azelf, Keldeo, Zarude, Skarmory, and Cobalion, giving it many opportunities to switch in. The main issue Noivern faces is competition with Crobat for a teamslot; Crobat's higher Speed gives it an edge one-on-one with Noivern, and it has the typing to better check Pokemon like Amoonguss and Conkeldurr that Noivern can struggle with. Still, Noivern's extra resistances to Water and Fire allow it to check the likes of Keldeo and Darmanitan, giving it the edge on a number of teams. Noivern also competes with Salamence to a lesser extent due to their shared typing; Salamence's bulk generally makes it better, as it can more reliably handle threats like Scizor and Cobalion, but some teams need Noivern's Speed tier. Another hindrance is Noivern's mediocre neutral power; it struggles to do lasting damage to Pokemon like Hippowdon, Slowking, Nihilego, and Mandibuzz without entry hazard support. Noivern is also entirely blanked by certain Fairy-types like Primarina and Togekiss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set with Draco Meteor, Hurricane, Flamethrower, and Switcheroo can be very difficult to switch into, but it's pretty thoroughly outclassed by other wallbreakers like Choice Specs Hydreigon. Taunt is an option over U-turn that can make handling Noivern very difficult for teams that rely on Hippowdon and Slowking to beat it, though not having U-turn makes Noivern significantly easier to deal with for offensive teams. Also, it is forced to run Hurricane over Draco Meteor to assure that it can break through Slowking, even with Taunt. Defog Noivern can be used as a last resort, but it has a poor matchup against most Stealth Rock setters and struggles to fit the move to begin with.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Primarina, Hatterene, and Togekiss all blank Noivern's most common moves entirely and can use it as setup fodder, but the former two must be wary of switching directly into Hurricane Noivern.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Hippowdon, Celesteela, and Chansey can all handle Noivern pretty well, though Noivern can outlast them in a long game due to entry hazard damage. Nihilego can check Noivern in the short term, with its great Special Defense letting it tank a couple of Draco Meteors, but without any way to recover its health, it isn't a hard counter. Heavy-Duty Boots Slowking is a hard stop to Noivern, although sets lacking Heavy-Duty Boots are prone to Spikes and U-turn wearing them down, even with Regenerator to offset it somewhat.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Noivern is extremely crippled by losing its item; Knock Off users like Tangrowth, Tentacruel, and Azelf can severely hamper it as a result. These Pokemon don't really like dealing with Noivern themselves, though.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Noivern's Speed means nothing when faced with priority users that can threaten it. Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine can OHKO, and while +2 Attack Scizor lacking Life Orb cannot OHKO Noivern, it can do so very easily after minor chip damage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Draco Meteor is generally preferred as a STAB move to OHKO the likes of Hydreigon and Salamence, in addition to being Noivern's strongest revenge killing tool overall. Hurricane can be used to nab the OHKO on Keldeo for teams particularly weak to it. Hurricane also can break through naturally bulky Pokemon like Hippowdon and Moltres because it doesn't lower Special Attack, and it does better damage to Tangrowth, Amoonguss, Fairy-types, and Conkeldurr—OHKOing the latter—than Flamethrower. Flamethrower fries Steel-types like Scizor, Skarmory, Excadrill, and Cobalion; it also peppers Celesteela, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss for decent damage. U-turn lets Noivern pivot out of bad matchups against switch-ins like Nihilego, Chansey, and Slowking; when combined with chip damage from entry hazards, Noivern can rack up damage on them very quickly. Roost is necessary to continuously check Pokemon like Cobalion, Zarude, and Keldeo throughout a game. Equipping Noivern with Heavy-Duty Boots is necessary, since Stealth Rock would otherwise greatly hinder its role as a pivot.</p> <p>Noivern's best teammates are entry hazard setters, which aid it in securing KOs against Pokemon like Hippowdon, Slowking, and Swampert. Skarmory is an excellent partner; not only does it lay Noivern's beloved Spikes, it also nicely checks the physical attackers Noivern can't deal with, like Swords Dance Excadrill, Diggersby, Mamoswine, and Scizor. Skarmory also appreciates Noivern's ability to switch into Pokemon like Azelf and Entei. Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock very easily and checks Pokemon like Hatterene, Nihilego, and Lycanroc-D that give Noivern a hard time; in return, Noivern is a great pivot into Zarude, Keldeo, and Skarmory. VoltTurn users like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, Raikou, and Azelf can easily weaken shared checks like Chansey, Hippowdon, and Nihilego. The former three can also check Primarina and Togekiss, two major roadblocks to Noivern, and all appreciate Noivern threatening Zarude, Tangrowth, and Hydreigon for them. Scizor threatens Fairy-types for Noivern while also removing items from Pokemon like Hippowdon and Moltres, making it tough for them to check Noivern in the long term. Vanilluxe can break through Hippowdon and Slowking for Noivern and greatly appreciates its U-turn providing entry points for it. Partners that can deal with Fairy-types are necessary; Hatterene, Togekiss, and Primarina are all major annoyances for Noivern, with the former in particular being a huge issue thanks to its Magic Bounce blanking Skarmory's Spikes; teammates such as Excadrill, Nidoqueen, Nihilego, and Galarian Slowbro can all be helpful here. These Pokemon also appreciate Noivern bringing them onto the field against the aforementioned Fairy-types via U-turn, as well as checking Zarude and Azelf for them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Zygarde-10% is a solid offensive Pokemon in UU thanks to its nearly unmatched Speed, outspeeding most offensive threats in the tier like Nihilego, Thundurus-T, and Cobalion. Thousand Arrows separates Zygarde-10% from other offensive Ground-types like Excadrill and Mamoswine because it can hit Flying-types like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Moltres while ignoring Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain. Extreme Speed is useful for picking off weakened setup sweepers and other faster threats like Gyarados and Choice Scarf Diggersby, letting Zygarde-10% be a potent revenge killer and a powerful cleaner. Sadly, Zygarde-10% has awful bulk, making pivots necessary, as even neutral attacks wear it down easily. Its mediocre Attack also means that it relies on chip damage to wear down foes such as Primarina, Slowking, Tangrowth, and Hippowdon. Its reliance on Choice Band means the aformentioned threats can switch into it and scout what move Zygarde-10% is locked into, letting them switch into a teammate that can handle whatever move Zygarde-10% goes for. Being locked into Extreme Speed is also risky, since it makes Zygarde-10% setup fodder for its checks like Swords Dance Scizor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zygarde-10% can run a Dragon Dance + Life Orb set to sweep weakened teams without locking itself into moves, but Gyarados and Salamence can fulfill that role better with their superior bulk. Scale Shot gives it a secondary Dragon-type STAB move without having to lock into Outrage, but it’s inconsistency makes it not worth it most of the time. Iron Tail can hit Tapu Bulu and Hatterene super effectively, but it has poor accuracy and coverage compared to its other moves. A set with Coil and Thousand Waves can heavily punish teams that rely on Tangrowth and Hippowdon lacking Whirlwind to check it, but this set can struggle against teams without them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Physically defensive Tangrowth can consistently tank all of Zygarde-10%'s attacks, though it doesn't like Toxic. Zarude can consistently switch into Thousand Arrows and outspeed if it carries a Choice Scarf, but it has to watch out for Superpower and Skitter Smack. Tapu Bulu and Dhelmise resists Thousand Arrows and threatens Zygarde-10% with Horn Leech and Power Whip, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Azumarill and Primarina switch into Zygarde-10% can punish Zygarde-10% locked into Outrage while easily OHKOing it with Play Rough and Moonblast. Hatterene is able to trade with Zygarde-10% and restore its health with Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Diggersby and Hydreigon outspeed and KO Zygarde-10% easily. Mamoswine OHKOes it with Ice Shard, while Conkeldurr can do big damage with Mach Punch, though they have to be wary of Extreme Speed due to its higher priority. Scizor resists Outrage and Extreme Speed and can KO Zygarde-10% with Bullet Punch. Noivern naturally outspeeds Zygarde-10% and OHKOes it with Draco Meteor, while Crobat can pick off Zygarde-10% if it has chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Foes</strong>: Chansey, Slowking, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz can tank Thousand Arrows and heal it off reliably, with the latter two hitting Zygarde-10% hard in return. Swampert and bulky Salamence can switch in as well, but they must watch out for Outrage.</p>",

Outrage lets Zygarde-10% sweep late-game against weakened teams by getting OHKOs and 2HKOs Thousand Arrows cannot, punishing threats like Chansey, Salamence, and even Tangrowth and Hippowdon with some prior chip damage. However, being locked into Outrage is risky if the opponent has a Fairy- or Steel-type on their team. Superpower hits Chansey, Cobalion, and Zarude while providing good coverage overall.

Teammates like Chansey, Slowking, and Mandibuzz can deal with checks to Zygarde-10% like Primarina, Conkeldurr, and Zarude, and get it in safely with slow pivots. Zarude breaks though bulky Water-types like Swampert and Slowking, also bringing in Zygarde-10% on Skarmory and Cobalion to force them out. Moltres is an additional pivot that can deal with Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu, as well as bringing Zygarde-10% in against Tentacruel and Rotom-W. It also punishes Steel-types like Scizor coming in when Zygarde-10% is locked into Outrage or Extreme Speed. Nihilego and Skarmory handle Grass-types and sets up Stealth Rock and Spikes to wear down teams so Zygarde-10% can sweep with Thousand Arrows or Outrage. Skarmory also can shut down Hippowdon for Zygarde-10%. Rotom-W covers Mamoswine well while appreciating Thousand Arrows wearing down Amoonguss.

  "Primarina": {
    "overview": "<p>Primarina is one of the most versatile Pokemon in UU, utilizing its excellent typing, amazing movepool, and solid stats to serve as an integral defensive glue or a potent offensive threat. Water / Fairy is a valuable typing both offensively and defensively, allowing Primarina to answer dangerous threats like Hydreigon, Keldeo, and Salamence while breaking past common walls like Hippowdon and Skarmory. Its RestTalk set counters the likes of Hydreigon and Keldeo, absorbs debilitating status moves from threats like Hippowdon and Swampert, and utilizes its potent STAB combination to threaten the enemy team. Meanwhile, Primarina's three attacks set hones in on its great offensive potential, using coverage moves like Ice Beam and Psychic to overcome foes like Amoonguss and Tentacruel and Substitute to ease prediction by taking advantage of the many switches it forces. This set retains valuable defensive utility against foes like Keldeo, so it is a huge help to bulky offense and balance teams looking for a wallbreaker that can patch up defensive holes. Its Choice Specs set is one of the most difficult wallbreakers to account for, since it has no safe switch-ins apart from Chansey; it tears apart teams relying on Amoonguss and Tangrowth to beat it with its STAB moves and coverage. However, this set does lack the defensive utility of Primarina's other sets, and the three attacks set typically outdoes it as a wallbreaker because it nets the same KOs and has more defensive utility. Primarina's fatal flaw is its Speed, leaving it very vulnerable to getting overwhelmed by faster foes like Thundurus-T, Nihilego, and Zarude that threaten it with super effective damage. Its Defense requires investment so Primarina can check threats like Mamoswine, Cobalion, and Excadrill. RestTalk sets are overly reliant on Rest to heal, meaning they can be taken advantage of if they fail to get the right move when using Sleep Talk. Primarina faces competition from Keldeo as an offensive Water-type due to Keldeo's higher Speed and comparable power, but Primarina's lack of counters outside of Chansey and defensive capabilities let it find a strong place in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball on an all-out attacker set with Leftovers lets Primarina 2HKO Slowking and threaten Rotom-W and opposing Primarina more. Custap Berry is an option with Calm Mind to surprise and KO a revenge killer like Thundurus-T, but it is unreliable. Primarina can utilize a variety of Calm Mind sets to turn into a dangerous setup sweeper with free turns. Substitute / Calm Mind / Draining Kiss / Scald is incredibly annoying for revenge killers, as Primarina's increased bulk, safety net in Substitute, extra recovery, and potential to spread burns make it hard for foes like Amoonguss, Zarude, and Thundurus-T to deal with it. Calm Mind + Rest allows Primarina to utilize a stronger Fairy-type STAB in Moonblast while having Rest to heal itself, letting it take on foes like Keldeo more easily. Snore in conjunction with Liquid Voice keeps Primarina from being too passive while asleep and lets it take down foes like Hippowdon and even Scizor with its flinch chance. This Primarina set is its only set that can beat Chansey one-on-one. However, Primarina's lack of a Water-type attack when awake can be exploited by Fairy-type checks like Scizor and Nihilego. Choice Scarf Primarina surprises and wipes out revenge killers like Thundurus-T and Zarude, but it is still slow and fails to revenge kill setup sweepers like Gyarados and Necrozma and doesn't reach the crucial base 115 Speed tier, which includes Azelf and Zygarde-10%.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss, Dhelmise, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can switch into Primarina's STAB combination quite well, but they have to be wary of taking heavy damage from Ice Beam on offensive sets. Dhelmise also needs to be very cautious of Scald burns. Zarude outspeeds and OHKOes Primarina with Power Whip but can't switch in at all out of fear of taking Moonblast. Tapu Bulu needs to watch out for Ice Beam, but it has the luxury of being able to outspeed Choice Specs Primarina and scare it out with Horn Leech.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-W all outspeed and heavily pressure Primarina with their super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Chansey is the best general counter to all of Primarina's sets, being able to reliably switch in and whittle Primarina down with Seismic Toss while not minding any of its attacks. However, it does have to watch out for a Torrent-boosted Choice Specs Hydro Pump. Slowking can switch into Primarina's Moonblast well and pivot out with Teleport, but it gets 2HKOed by Moonblast from Choice Specs sets. Tentacruel only has to watch out for Psychic but otherwise takes Primarina's well and pressures it with Sludge Bomb. Celesteela hates Scald burns as well as a Choice Specs Hydro Pump, but it's able to deal heavy damage to Primarina with Heavy Slam.</p>",

Moonblast wipes out the likes of Zarude, Hydreigon, and Salamence and provides strong neutral coverage RestTalk lets Primarina continuously check foes like Keldeo, Crawdaunt, and Salamence; absorb status; and remain an active threat after recovering its health. Leftovers gives Primarina passive recovery to take hits better from Salamence and Cobalion without being forced to use Rest. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option to offset entry hazard damage on teams that lack entry hazard removal. However, the lack of Leftovers recovery limits Primarina's usefulness when asleep after using Rest, and it's only a better choice over Leftovers against Spikes teams. Maximum investment in Defense allows Primarina to check threats like Cobalion, Zygarde-10%, and Hippowdon more easily. Alternatively, heavy investment in Special Defense allows Primarina to more reliably beat Amoonguss one-on-one and better take on strong special attackers like Salamence and Azelf.</p> <p>This Primarina set best fits on bulky offense and balance teams as a reliable defensive glue that counters dangerous threats like Keldeo and Hydreigon. Grass-types like Zarude and Tangrowth are massive threats, so Amoonguss and Skarmory are great teammates to handle them. They both also help check Scizor, with the latter taking on foes like Mamoswine and Excadrill as well. Dhelmise and Assault Vest Tangrowth handle dangerous Electric-types like Thundurus-T and Raikou. Tangrowth is also a backup check to Keldeo and keeps Primarina from being overwhelmed by Zygarde-10% and Excadrill. Primarina is incredibly vulnerable to Spikes without Heavy-Duty Boots, so entry hazard removal from the likes of Salamence, Excadrill, and Dhelmise is appreciated. Hippowdon takes on Electric-types, and its Stealth Rock can slowly wear down threats like Celesteela and Rotom-W. In return, Primarina defeats offensive Water-types like Keldeo and Crawdaunt. Offensive Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Azelf appreciate Primarina countering Noivern and Choice Scarf Hydreigon; they take on Poison-types like Tentacruel and Amoonguss in return. Scizor can reliably switch into the likes of Chansey, Nihilego, and Tangrowth and force them out, and it enjoys Primarina's support against Moltres and Salamence.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This Primarina set is a potent wallbreaker with passive recovery to help check threats like Keldeo. Primarina's usual STAB combination allows it to cover the vast majority of the tier and threaten common Pokemon like Hippowdon, Scizor, Salamence, and Cobalion. Ice Beam wipes out Tangrowth and Amoonguss attempting to switch into Primarina and also hits Thundurus-T and Togekiss super effectively. Alternatively, Psychic covers Amoonguss and deals heavy damage to Tentacruel for teams that need extra insurance against it. Substitute allows Primarina to take a hit from revenge killers like Thundurus-T and Zarude and threaten heavy damage back while easing prediction. It can get up Substitute as it forces switches against foes like Hippowdon. Protect allows Primarina to scout Choice-locked threats like Diggersby and Zarude and regain its health with Leftovers. Calm Mind is an option to turn Primarina into a dangerous setup sweeper that can break past unsuspecting Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Leftovers gives Primarina the longevity to take on Keldeo and Salamence more easily. Rindo Berry lets Primarina take a Power Whip from Zarude and Tangrowth and KO them in return, though Primarina misses the passive recovery Leftovers provides and should typically be run when using Protect or Calm Mind. 136 Speed EVs let Primarina outspeed Conkeldurr. 160 Special Attack EVs guarantee the 2HKO on Assault Vest Tangrowth with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are in HP to check the likes of Hippowdon and Keldeo more easily.</p> <p>This Primarina set best fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its firepower and defensive utility. Entry hazard support is essential in softening up switch-ins like Slowking and Tangrowth, making teammates like Nihilego, Nidoqueen, and Skarmory great. Beyond setting entry hazards, Nihilego can hinder Chansey and Celesteela with Knock Off and pressure Thundurus-T. Nidoqueen pressures Tangrowth and Amoonguss, while Skarmory can reliably take on Zarude and Scizor. Physical wallbreakers like Cobalion and Mamoswine break through specially defensive foes like Chansey. Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth work in tandem with Primarina to check Keldeo while beating threats like Rotom-W and Thundurus-T. Amoonguss also counters opposing Tangrowth. These Pokemon should be used as primary checks to Keldeo so Primarina can focus on wallbreaking more. Pivots like Hydreigon, Crobat, Azelf, and Rotom-H all create opportunities for Primarina to enter the field safely and wallbreak against foes like Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and opposing Hydreigon. Choice Scarf Hydreigon can revenge kill faster threats like Thundurus-T and Rotom-W, while Azelf wears down Celesteela and wipes out Nidoqueen and Nihilego. Crobat and Rotom-H take on Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Ice Beam allows Primarina to destroy Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, and Assault Vest Tangrowth with ease. Alternatively, Psychic retains coverage for Amoonguss and allows Primarina to break past Tentacruel. Scald is used as a reliable Water-type attack to nail foes like Scizor, Hippowdon, and Galarian Slowbro without risking a Hydro Pump miss. It also threatens a burn on switch-ins like Tentacruel and Amoonguss. With a Choice Specs and Modest nature, Primarina is able to 2HKO everything barring Chansey, easily wiping out specially defensive tanks like Celesteela, Slowking, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Chansey itself is even at risk of being 2HKOed by Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump if it has taken a bit of chip damage.</p> <p>Choice Specs Primarina is at home on bulky offense and balance teams that provide it free switches to wallbreak while covering its limited defenses. Entry hazard support from Spikes setters like Skarmory and Stealth Rock setters like Nidoqueen amplifies Primarina's offensive presence, putting its already limited switch-ins like Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Tangrowth in range of even resisted attacks. Nidoqueen also is useful in pressuring Cobalion and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Since Primarina lacks recovery and has low Defense, pivots are needed to bring it in safely to wallbreak. Chansey is a defensive pivot that can take on foes Primarina normally would, like Salamence, Moltres, and Hydreigon and bring in Primarina with Teleport against foes like Scizor. A Scizor of your own is useful in wearing down Celesteela with Knock Off as well as countering Chansey and Tangrowth. Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss check Grass- and Electric-types like Zarude, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-W. They also cover foes Primarina normally would, like Keldeo. Amoonguss's Stun Spore can be useful in offsetting Primarina's poor Speed. Rapid Spin Dhelmise also checks Thundurus-T and Keldeo while keeping it from getting worn down by entry hazards. Celesteela can scout Primarina's attack with Protect, so teammates that can threaten Celesteela, like Raikou, work well. Azelf and Nihilego can lure in Chansey and remove its Eviolite with Knock Off, making it easier to break through. If Primarina is in Torrent range, Chansey cannot switch in at all. Choice Scarf users like Diggersby and Hydreigon can also bring Primarina in safely against foes like Hippowdon, as well as revenge kill faster threats like Raikou, Thundurus-T, and Zarude. Physical wallbreakers like Zygarde-10% and Swords Dance Cobalion are great teammates, wiping out Chansey and Celesteela.

It's also immune to secondary effects thanks to Shield Dust; this makes it impossible for Pokemon like Choice Scarf Jirachi to antilead it, and its access to Skill Swap means that not even Hatterene can prevent it from getting its entry hazard up. As a result, Ribombee is a cornerstone on Sticky Web teams as the best available setter. It can struggle with certain hazard removers that resist Moonblast, though; examples include Excadrill, Moltres, and Tentacruel. It can also give free turns to the likes of Amoonguss, Scizor, and Autotomize Celesteela, though the latter dislikes being hit by Stun Spore.</p>",

Quiver Dance is an option, but Ribombee's inability to touch common Steel-types like Scizor and Celesteela makes it a hugely unreliable sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Scizor, Celesteela, and Jirachi wall Ribombee permanently and can KO it with their STAB attacks or use it as setup fodder, though they all hate Stun Spore barring Safety Goggles Scizor, particularly Choice Scarf variants of Jirachi. Excadrill is the most troublesome due to its ability to remove Sticky Web with Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Nidoking, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel all take little damage from Moonblast and can slam Ribombee hard with their STAB moves. Tentacruel can also use Rapid Spin in Ribombee's face before KOing it with Sludge Bomb, making it impossible for Ribombee to get its entry hazard up.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rotom-H, Moltres, and Entei take very little damage and can threaten Ribombee easily in return.

It also cripples setup sweepers like Gyarados and Galarian Slowbro that try to take advantage of Ribombee while also paralyzing wallbreakers like Nihilego and Nidoking. U-turn can work well with Stun Spore to pivot out against threats who switch into Stun Spore like Excadrill, allowing Ribombee to bring in a teammate to pave the way for it to safely set up Sticky Web again. Skill Swap is primarily used to bypass Hatterene's Magic Bounce, but it can have bonus effects like removing Beast Boost from Nihilego or Sheer Force from Nidoking, opening up Ribombee's teammates a bit.

Access to strong coverage moves, such as Close Combat to break past Excadrill, Psychic Fangs to break past Amoonguss, and Crunch to deal with Slowking makes Lycanroc-D very unpredictable to defensively answer. However, Lycanroc-D struggles to break through teams that run physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth, Hippowdon, Swampert, and Skarmory. Its poor bulk also means it cannot come in on almost anything, so it requires pivot support to come in safely as well as occasional aggressive prediction on expected switches. Lycanroc-D is also very prone to wearing itself down between entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, limiting its staying presence on the field. The presence of priority attackers like Scizor and Azumarill can easily pick off Lycanroc-D. Zygarde-10% gives Lycanroc-D fierce competition as a fast physical wallbreaker due to a Stealth Rock resistance, higher Speed, and less prediction reliance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sucker Punch can be used to deal more damage than Accelerock against neutral targets; however, it is only really useful for a better matchup against Choice Scarf Jirachi. Swords Dance is an option that allows Lycanroc-D to OHKO foes like Amoonguss and Tangrowth at +2; however, it can struggle to find many opportunities to set up safely. A Focus Sash lead Lycanroc-D is able to use Endeavor while setting up Stealth Rock, but this is generally not worth it in comparison to its other, much more dynamic sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu do not switch into Stone Edge well, but they resist Close Combat and threaten Lycanroc-D after switching in; the former also runs Rocky Helmet often, which punishes Lycanroc-D. Tangrowth is the biggest offender, since unboosted Close Combat damage is restored nearly completely by Regenerator, it commonly uses Rocky Helmet, and it can freely threaten Lycanroc-D's team in multiple ways after it comes in. Choice Scarf Zarude takes Accelrock well and can OHKO it with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Skarmory's excellent physical bulk and reliable recovery lets it effortlessly wall Lycanroc-D unless significantly chipped, though it does have to be way of switching into Choice Band Close Combat. It also can wear Lycanroc-D down with Rocky Helmet. Choice Scarf Jirachi resists Lycanroc-D's Accelrock and can revenge kill it with Iron Head. Scizor can revege kill Lycanroc-D easily with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Foes like Slowking, Primarina, and Swampert that don't fall to one hit and are capable of firing back with super effective attacks pose problems for Lycanroc-D, which has to be kept in reserve while its teammates wear them down.

Psychic Fangs inflicts heavy damage on the likes of Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Keldeo. Crunch hits Slowking, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro harder, but these targets get musceled through by Stone Edge or Close Combat.

It also makes Lycanroc-D more difficult to revenge kill with faster threats such as Starmie, Azelf, and Noivern which all need to watch their health against it. A Life Orb is used to guarantee feats such as 2HKOing defensive Celesteela with Close Combat and Amoonguss with Stone Edge on the switch with Stealth Rock up. Alternatively, Choice Band lets Lycanroc-D avoid the recoil associated with Life Orb while still boosting its power at the cost of being more predicition reliant. With Stealth Rock and Spikes up, Lycanroc-D can even break past Skarmory and Hippowdon. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is needed to make Lycanroc-D outspeed and threaten as many foes as it can, particularly Keldeo.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D fits best on offensive teams, namely VoltTurn and Spikes stacking, that appreciate its ability to revenge kill common offensive threats such as Salamence without sacrificing its teammates' wallbreaking capabilities. As Lycanroc-D is unable to switch in on mostly anything, pivots are appreciated to give it opportunities to punch holes as often as possible and gain momentum; Moltres and Rotom-H are efficient at this and help pressure Skarmory and bulky Grass-types, which usually give Lycanroc-D grief. Rotom-W takes on Skarmory and Celesteela for Lycanroc-D and can bring it in against Chansey and Hydreigon. Entry hazard setters like Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Nihilego are important to wear down defensive walls like Tangrowth and opposing Hippowdon in range of Lycanroc-D's attacks. Skarmory, mainly Iron Defense variants, also counters Scizor and Azumarill for Lycanroc-D. Hippowdon can cripple Tangrowth and Slowking with Toxic, while Nihilego pressures Skarmory. Special attackers such as Hydreigon and Primarina appreciate Lycanroc-D's ability to break through Chansey, and in return they can help wear down common physically defensive threats such as Skarmory for it, paving the way for a late-game cleanup. The Grass-types of the tier like Tangrowth and Zarude are excellent partners to handle threats such as Azumarill. Additionally, they also check faster Pokemon Lycanroc-D cannot threaten as much with its priority, such as Zygarde-10%.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Salazzle's good Speed tier, ability in Corrosion, and solid offensive utility make it a decent support Pokemon in UU. It can outspeed many offensive threats such as Zarude and Azelf, and it takes advantage of defensive staples like Amoonguss and Skarmory. The combination of Knock Off and Toxic lets it outlast Pokemon that would otherwise counter it, such as Tentacruel and Nihilego, and open up counters like Hippowdon for teammates. However, due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Salazzle is forced to run Heavy-Duty Boots as opposed to a power-boosting item, which makes it heavily reliant on chip damage to make an impact. Its poor bulk also leaves it unable to contribute defensively in most games, and its typing makes it susceptible to priority users like Azumarill and Lycanroc-D. Salazzle's frailty also makes it reliant on pivots to safely enter the battlefield. This frailty also deters it from switching directly into most Pokemon it would otherwise check, especially Scizor and Tangrowth, who both carry Knock Off and can remove its Heavy-Duty Boots. Therefore, it would rather be preserved as a secondary check to the aforementioned Pokemon. It is also extremely difficult for Salazzle to make progress against bulkier Pokemon like Slowking and Hippowdon, but its Toxic support and chip damage can help mid-game wallbreakers and offensive pivots like Mamoswine and Azelf, respectively, break through or pressure them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Pulse can OHKO Zygarde-10% but should only be used if your team is weak to it. Nasty Plot over Toxic can make Salazzle a threatening wallbreaker or cleaner, but due to its frailty, it struggles to set up because even resisted attacks sting. Substitute + Toxic Salazzle can be annoying, but Salazzle struggles to make an impact when lacking one of its STAB moves, leaving it to pick and choose its good matchups and lose out on valuable utility. Substitute + Toxic also requires very solid entry hazard control, if running Black Sludge, and is still vulnerable to sand chip damage. A Choice Specs set has powerful wallbreaking potential, OHKOing threats like Conkeldurr and Thundurus-T from full health, but Salazzle can't follow up with Toxic and becomes weak to Stealth Rock, cutting into its longevity. It is also extremely prediction reliant, heavily limiting its wallbreaking potential against common defensive staples like Slowking and Hippowdon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority</strong>: Pokemon that commonly run Choice Scarf, such as Hydreigon and Diggersby, take advantage of Salazzle's extreme frailty and revenge kill it with ease. Priority users like Lycanroc-D and Zygarde-10% revenge kill Salazzle as well. Crobat and Noivern naturally outspeed and nail Salazzle for heavy damage.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey can switch into Salazzle thanks to its reliable recovery and Natural Cure, proceeding to force Salazzle out. However, it hates taking Knock Off. Mandibuzz, specially defensive Hippowdon, and Nihilego are all able to switch in comfortably; however, they all hate Knock Off and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Slowking, Tentacruel, and Swampert can all switch into Salazzle multiple times but despise taking Toxic. Azumarill can KO Salazzle with Aqua Jet.</p>",

Maximum Speed investment is needed to outspeed offensive threats like Azelf, Zarude, and Cobalion. Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates Salazzle's crippling Stealth Rock weakness and helps with its longevity, giving it more opportunities to enter the field safely.</p> <p>Salazzle fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate it heavily chipping the opposing team, paving the way for teammates to break holes with ease. Mamoswine is an excellent partner for Salazzle, beating checks like Chansey and Mandibuzz and wearing down their shared answers in Swampert and Slowking. Chip damage from Stealth Rock setters, such as Nihilego, Cobalion, and Swampert, is valuable to make switching into Salazzle even more of a pain. Knock Off absorbers, such as the aforementioned Cobalion, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth, are all appreciated due to how punishing it is for Salazzle to lose Heavy-Duty Boots. Cobalion in particular can draw in Grass-types to give Salazzle entry points to fire off an attack. Meanwhile, Amoonguss and Tangrowth check Swampert and Azumarill. Thundurus-T and Zarude are great partners, as both offensively pressure Slowking and Swampert while pivoting on Amoonguss and Tangrowth, giving Salazzle safe entry points despite its frailty. Celesteela and Slowking both reliably check Nihilego and Zygarde-10% for Salazzle. Slowking is able to pivot out on Grass-types with Teleport to let Salazzle in. Checks to defensive Scizor like Celesteela, Cobalion, and Salamence all pair well with Salazzle, as it cannot function as the sole Scizor check on most teams. Salamence also appreciates Salazzle wearing down Hippowdon and Slowking through Knock Off + Toxic, as this makes it extremely difficult for them to switch into repeated Hurricanes.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Dhelmise has a unique niche as a reliable spinblocker against Excadrill while providing entry hazard removal for its team with Rapid Spin of its own. Its Grass typing allows it to absorb Thousand Arrows from Zygarde-10%, which otherwise heavily threatens the Spikes stacking teams Dhelmise finds itself on. Dhelmise possesses semi-reliable recovery via Synthesis, letting it keep itself healthy to spinblock and better check common threats like Keldeo, Primarina, and Thundurus-T throughout a game. Dhelmise has respectable offensive presence while spinblocking thanks to its naturally high Attack stat and good STAB combination. However, Dhelmise is very slow and can be worn down quickly, forcing it to recover with Synthesis often, thus providing the opposing team with many free turns. Dhelmise is additionally threatened by common Pokemon like Hydreigon and Salamence, limiting its switch-in opportunities. Synthesis recovery is also hindered by the presence of sand from the extremely splashable Hippowdon, reducing Dhelmise's longevity. Dhelmise faces stiff competition from Amoonguss and Tangrowth as a defensive Grass-type; these two have greater physical bulk, are able to keep themselves healthy with Regenerator, and possess additional utility in the form of Spore from Amoonguss and coverage options like Sludge Bomb and Focus Blast from Tangrowth. Amoonguss's Poison typing also lets it check threats like Primarina and Zarude better than Dhelmise.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off punishes switch-ins that resist Dhelmise's STAB moves, like Mandibuzz, Zarude, and Hydreigon. Since Poltergeist cannot be used against Pokemon that have had their item removed, it may be prudent to run Knock Off instead of Poltergeist rather than alongside it. However, this reduces Dhelmise's overall damage output. Body Press can hit Dark-types like Zarude and Hydreigon for super effective damage, but is generally not worth running over its STAB moves. Rest is an option to alleviate status from foes like Hippowdon, letting Dhelmise fear nothing from them, but Rest is more exploitable compared to Synthesis. A trapping set of Anchor Shot, Swords Dance, Rapid Spin, and Rest with Leftovers or Chesto Berry can be used to lure walls like Skarmory and Tangrowth and use them as setup fodder, but this set falls flat into Scizor and generally has poor coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: While a Colbur Berry can help to absorb one Dark-type attack in a pinch, Dark-types like Zarude, Hydreigon, and Mandibuzz resist both of Dhelmise's STAB attacks and threaten super effective damage with their own STAB attacks. Umbreon does not resist Power Whip, but has access to Wish and enough bulk to take repeated hits, along with Toxic and Foul Play to threaten Dhelmise. Knock Off from Pokemon like Scizor, Azumarill, and Conkeldurr also threatens Dhelmise, especially if it is not holding a Colbur Berry, since it reduces Dhelmise's effectiveness as an entry hazard remover and spinblocker.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Crobat, Moltres, Salamence, and Togekiss threaten heavy damage or OHKOs on Dhelmise with their Flying-type STAB attacks. Celesteela threatens Dhelmise with Flamethrower on defensive sets and Air Slash and Fire Blast on offensive sets and has the bulk to repeatedly take Poltergeist from Dhelmise.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Moltres, Chandelure, and Rotom-H all threaten massive damage on Dhelmise with their STAB attacks. Several Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Azelf, and Diggersby commonly run Fire-type coverage, which prevents Dhelmise from reliably checking them.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Scald burns from Pokemon like Slowking, Primarina, and Tentacruel as well as Will-O-Wisp from Rotom-W reduce Dhelmise's damage output and force it to use Synthesis more often, reducing its effectiveness as a spinblocker and providing free turns for switching or set up when Dhelmise is forced to recover. Toxic from Pokemon like Hippowdon, Chansey, and Swampert forces it to recover even more frequently than burns do.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Rocky Helmet users like Amoonguss, Cobalion, and Skarmory punish Dhelmise for using Rapid Spin and have high enough Defense to take Poltergeist and Power Whip from Dhelmise many times if needed. Skarmory and Synthesis Amoonguss may also be able to PP stall Poltergeist due to its low PP, despite it not making contact, leaving Dhelmise unable to meaningfully damage them. Hippowdon's Sand Stream hampers Dhelmise's longevity by reducing the healing of Synthesis. Hippowdon fears Power Whip from Dhelmise, but is bulky enough to take one if needed, and can recover HP back throughout a game with Slack Off, plaguing Dhelmise.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Power Whip threatens Excadrill and Rotom-W, two common entry hazard removers, as well as common entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Swampert. Poltergeist provides strong neutral coverage on many Pokemon that resist Power Whip, such as Salamence, Scizor, Moltres, and Crobat. Synthesis provides reliable recovery to keep Dhelmise healthy and check Thundurus-T, Keldeo, and Primarina long-term. The given bulk avoids the 2HKO from maximum Special Attack Primarina's Moonblast and the 3HKO from Thundurus-T's Psychic, while the Speed investment outspeeds defensive Celesteela. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Dhelmise to avoid chip damage from the entry hazards it is tasked with removing. Alternatively, Colbur Berry can be used to allow Dhelmise to absorb Knock Off from Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Scizor, and Krookodile and take one Dark-type attack to remove entry hazards in an emergency, such as Dark Pulse from Hydreigon or Darkest Lariat from Zarude. Dhelmise can make use of a more physically defensive EV spread to better facilitate this scenario.</p> <p>Dhelmise is most commonly found on Spikes stacking teams, pairing well with Spikes setters and their beneficiaries. Skarmory excels as a teammate, as it is an excellent Spikes setter that can also absorb Knock Off aimed at Dhelmise. It also takes on dangerous offensive threats that Dhelmise cannot handle, such as Mamoswine, Zarude, and Scizor. Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego and Chansey help to further accentuate entry hazard damage and appreciate Dhelmise taking on Excadrill. Nihilego also provides Knock Off to force more Pokemon to take damage from entry hazards and can take on Flying-types like Moltres, Togekiss, and Salamence for Dhelmise. Meanwhile, Chansey takes on dangerous special attackers like Hydreigon, Chandelure, and Nidoqueen. Togekiss and the aforementioned Chansey can provide cleric support through Heal Bell and Aromatherapy, respectively, to rid Dhelmise of status and improve its longevity. Togekiss is notable for also being able to switch into and pressure Dark-types like Zarude and Hydreigon. Fast Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T take advantage of Spikes well thanks to Volt Switch maintaining momentum and forcing Spikes damage on switch-ins, naturally pressuring Flying-types like Togekiss and Celesteela for Dhelmise. Other offensive partners like Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, Mamoswine, and Azelf also pair well with Dhelmise, since it is able to maintain the Spikes that make these wallbreakers even harder to switch into. They can wipe out threats like Amoonguss, Salamence, and Skarmory for Dhelmise in return. Slowking can switch into Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Moltres, Nidoqueen, and Celesteela. Primarina can comfortably sponge any attack from Hydreigon, which Spikes teams often have difficulty switching into if they lack Chansey. Rotom-W can take on offensive variants of Celesteela and helps exert damage through Volt Switch. Dhelmise's teammates should be mindful of their Knock Off use, as Dhelmise will be unable to use Poltergeist against Pokemon that have had their items removed.</p>"

Tapu Bulu has a great movepool with coverage options like Close Combat, Zen Headbutt, and Stone Edge, which break through potential checks such as Celesteela, Amoonguss, and Moltres. Furthermore, its decent defensive typing, speed, and ability in Grassy Terrain allows it to distinguish itself from other bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth by being a more reliable check to Keldeo and Azumarill as well as enable threats like SubToxic Aegislash, though it does have to be wary of the former crippling it with a Scald burn and hitting it with Choice Specs-boosted Air Slash or Icy Wind. While Tapu Bulu's typing has many useful resistances, it comes at the cost of having a lot of weaknesses to common attacking types like Fire, Ice, and Poison, meaning it struggles against staples like Entei, Mamoswine, Nidoking, and even Kommo-o due to its tendency to run Poison Jab. The tier has an abundance of defensive checks to Tapu Bulu, such as Salamence, Amoonguss, and Aegislash, which makes it difficult for Tapu Bulu to make much progress as a wallbreaker, especially when multiple of these checks are naturally found on the same team. Despite its positive traits compared to Amoonguss and Tangrowth, they still outclass it as a defensive Grass-type due to their access to Regenerator and less vulnerable typing. Furthermore, Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain also heals up the opponent's Pokemon as well, sometimes making it a hindrance to teams it is on.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band is an option that gives Tapu Bulu even more power; however, it requires a lot more prediction to break through its checks like Amoonguss, and Wood Hammer recoil can wear it down quickly. A Choice Scarf set can be used to revenge kill foes like Thundurus and Noivern; however, it primarily relies on surprise factor to do so. A specially defensive Tapu Bulu set with Horn Leech / Darkest Lariat / Synthesis and either Bulk Up or Swords Dance can be used as a better switch-in to foes like Keldeo and Thundurus-T. However, this set is a huge momentum drain against foes like Amoonguss, Kommo-o, and Celesteela. An Assault Vest set improves its matchup against the aforementioned foes while retaining an offensive presence; however, it can be easily overwhelmed by special attackers such as Primarina.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Chandelure is a relatively safe switch-in to Tapu Bulu's most spammable moves and threatens to OHKO it. Rotom-H has to be wary of taking Close Combat; however, it can threaten to OHKO with Overheat and use Tapu Bulu as a free Volt Switch or Defog opportunity. Moltres has to be wary of Stone Edge but otherwise freely switches into Tapu Bulu and threatens to burn it with Flame Body or KO it with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Many of UU's more common Steel-types like Celesteela and Jirachi only take neutral damage from Close Combat and threaten to KO Tapu Bulu. Aegislash can comfortably stomach any hit in Shield forme and OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Nihilego and Nidoking outspeed and OHKO Tapu Bulu with their Poison-type STAB. Without Darkest Lariat, Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro sets up on it with ease. Amoonguss threatens to OHKO Tapu Bulu with Sludge Bomb, though it has to be wary of +2 Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically defensive Tangrowth stomachs any attack barring a +2 Megahorm and OHKOes Tapu Bulu with Sludge Bomb. Salamence is a huge issue for Tapu Bulu, as it resists the coverage it commonly carries and pressures it with Flying-type attacks, though it has to be wary of Stone Edge. Intimidate makes it much easier for Salamence to stomach any hit from Tapu Bulu. Defensive Buzzwole can stomach any attack and KO Tapu Bulu with Poison Jab.</p>",

Zen Headbutt breaks through Amoonguss, Kommo-o, and Buzzwole. Megahorn can help against Tangrowth; however, its coverage isn't very useful otherwise. Darkest Lariat can be used to hit Pokemon like Jirachi, Aegislash, and Chandelure harder.

A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Buzzwole and Timid Volcanion, though Adamant's power is generally valued more.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu fits best on offense and balance teams that appreciate its combination of utility and wallbreaking potential. Rotom-W can lure in foes like Seismitoad, giving Tapu Bulu free opportunities to use Swords Dance. Rotom-W can also remove foes like Moltres and wear down Kommo-o and Amoonguss into KO range of Tapu Bulu's attacks. Other wallbreakers like Conkeldurr and Nidoking can help break through defensive cores that Tapu Bulu struggles with. Keldeo appreciates Tapu Bulu being able to lure in and remove bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Tentacruel is appreciated as another Water-resistant Pokemon, as Tapu Bulu doesn't want to risk a burn from Keldeo's Scald, for example. Although Tapu Bulu is a Fairy-type, it struggles to consistently check a majority of Dragon-types, such as Salamence and Kommo-o, due to its lack of a good Fairy-type attack and its weakness to their common coverage.

Nihilego is an amazing Stealth Rock setter, as its resistances give very good matchups against Defoggers such as Salamence, Moltres, and Mandibuzz. Its Knock Off is useful for common switch-ins like Chansey, Scizor, Excadrill, and Celesteela. It can use Meteor Beam as well to boost its Special Attack and become a fierce sweeper. Its unique Speed tier puts it ahead of Salamence, Thundurus-T, and Moltres, and after a Speed boost from Beast Boost, it only falls behind Choice Scarf Zarude. However, its weaknesses and horrid Defense stat leave it vulnerable to Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Cobalion, and Keldeo, and priority from the likes of Conkeldurr, Azumarill, and Scizor easily shuts it down.

Toxic Spikes is a secondary entry hazard option that weakens defensive staples like Swampert and cripples Substitute users such as Primarina. However, Poison-types remove it and a large portion of the metagame is immune to it, like Salamence, Celesteela, and Scizor. A Choice Scarf set with Power Gem / Sludge Bomb / Thunderbolt / Grass Knot lets Nihilego clean through teams and revenge kill Pokemon like Crobat and other Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, but Choice-locked Nihilego is vulnerable to Pokemon like Scizor and Azumarill. Pain Split can be considered as a form of recovery on the utility set, but it is very unreliable due to Nihilego's high HP and can only be used against special attackers that can't hurt it much.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is Nihilego's best answer, capable of wearing it down with Seismic Toss and healing itself with Soft-Boiled. As long as Chansey doesn't let it accumulate several boosts, it can always beat Nihilego. Chansey hates having its Eviolite removed, though.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Swampert don't care about Nihilego's STAB moves and can force it out of the field with their STAB Ground-type moves, but the latter two dislike getting hit with Knock Off. Zygarde-10% and Choice Scarf Diggersby outspeeds and OHKOes Nihilego.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Excadrill and Jirachi wall Nihilego easily and can scare it out with their STAB attacks.

Power Gem can be used in place of Thunderbolt for a more reliable hit on Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Salamence, and Thundurus-T. Grass Knot deals with Ground-types like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Quagsire. Pain Split can be used to give Nihilego some recovery, though the lack of coverage creates more issues. Power Herb is required for Meteor Beam. The given EV spread and a Timid nature make Speed Nihilego's highest stat for Beast Boost, letting it outspeed revenge killers like Keldeo and Azelf.</p> <p>This set fits on hyper offense teams, where Nihilego can KO weakened checks like Celesteela with Meteor Beam to boost both its Speed and Special Attack. Entry hazard setters like Krookodile, Scolipede, and Excadrill help Nihilego by weakening some of its checks, like Nidoking and Celesteela. Keldeo and Belly Drum Azumarill are extremely strong wallbreakers that can punch holes for Nihilego to sweep late-game, destroying Chansey, Celesteela, and Excadrill. Secondary sweepers like Gyarados and Scizor can break past or dent Nidoqueen and Steel-types like Jirachi, Aegislash, and Celesteela. In return, Nihilego can remove Thundurus-T.</p>"

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<p>Celesteela's typing and defensive stats are both fantastic in UU, allowing it to check a considerable portion of UU's top threats, including Salamence, Scizor, Diggersby, Hippowdon, Nihilego, and Excadrill. Thanks to its decent offensive stats, powerful STAB Heavy Slam, and access to Flamethrower to smack foes like Amoonguss and Zarude, Celesteela can prevent itself from being too passive. Leech Seed is also an excellent tool, sustaining Celesteela's longevity and allowing it to significantly wear down its switch-ins, such as Rotom-H and Thundurus-T, potentially forcing them out, while Toxic lures and cripples otherwise safe switch-ins like Rotom-W, Slowking, and Moltres. Celesteela can also operate with an Autotomize set, tapping into its strong special coverage and the sweeping potential Beast Boost lends it to clean through many unprepared teams. Despite its defensive potency, however, Celesteela suffers a bit from its lack of access to reliable recovery, which can prevent it from tanking strong neutral hits as consistently as it would like to and cause it to be overreliant on Leftovers. This can allow a few common Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Mamoswine, to muscle past Celesteela after relatively minimal chip damage. Celesteela also struggles to bypass popular Fire- and Electric-types such as Moltres and Thundurus-T on its own, as well as various defensive picks like Tentacruel and Slowking; Tentacruel can utilize Liquid Ooze to take advantage of Leech Seed, while Slowking doesn't take meaningful damage from any of Celesteela's attacks, can absorb Leech Seed and Teleport out, and can threaten to chip Celesteela down with burns from Scald.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flash Cannon is an option over Air Slash for Celesteela's Meteor Beam set, dealing super effective damage to common answers like Nihilego. Meanwhile, Giga Drain lets it bypass Rotom-W and Slowking easier. However, these moves are much harder to fit compared to Air Slash's ability to flinch down slower checks like Moltres. Celesteela can utilize a mixed Assault Vest set to better answer Primarina and Salamence, with its colorful movepool letting it surprise typical checks such as Slowking with Megahorn and Moltres with Stone Edge and potentially break large holes in the opposing team. Due to its selection of potent physical moves such as Earthquake and Stone Edge, Celesteela can also run a physically based Autotomize set, effectively luring checks like Tentacruel and Rotom-H. However, this generally isn't as effective due to Celesteela's middling immediate power and hardships breaking various Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Skarmory.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Moltres, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can pivot in on both Heavy Slam and Flamethrower and hit Celesteela hard with super effective STAB moves. Moltres is particularly annoying, often being able to restore any chip damage it sustains from Leech Seed with Roost. However, they must run from Meteor Beam on Celesteela's Autotomize set.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou can tank hits from either of Celesteela's sets and proceed to break past it with super effective STAB attacks, though they all take fair damage from Meteor Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Chansey doesn't take major damage from Celesteela's attacks and can whittle it down with Seismic Toss or bring in a teammate with Teleport. Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze punishes Leech Seed attempts and it doesn't take major damage from any attack Celesteela commonly runs. Slowking can pivot into Celesteela and Teleport out to stop Leech Seed or chip it with Scald. However, it hates taking a Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Celesteela's defensive set becomes far easier to wear down if Leftovers, its most reliable means of passive recovery, has been removed. Knock Off users like Mamoswine, Azelf, and Scizor can wear it down immensely as it tries potentially pivoting in on them. The Autotomize set is also often reliant on Power Herb to pose a significant offensive threat, which can prevent Celesteela from setting up on foes like Scizor and Tangrowth as safely as it would like to at times.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Celesteela's lack of reliable recovery allows particularly powerful wallbreakers, including Conkeldurr, Primarina, Mamoswine, and Keldeo, to quickly overwhelm it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Flamethrower keeps Steel-types like Scizor and Excadrill in line and forces them out. It also hits Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Zarude, which are immune to Leech Seed. Leech Seed is important to wear down common switch-ins, including Moltres, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T. It also prevents Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragon Dance Salamence from reliably setting up on Celesteela, chipping them down. Toxic cripples switch-ins like Slowking, Rotom-W, and Assault Vest Tangrowth, allowing Celesteela to overcome them in the long-term. Meanwhile, Protect works well alongside Leech Seed, offering Celesteela a guaranteed opportunity to restore health with both Leftovers and Leech Seed. It can also help to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon, like Zygarde-10% and Keldeo.</p> <p>Celesteela is a solid fit on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its ability to check several prominent threats like Scizor and Zarude, allowing offensive teammates to fall back on it upon losing momentum to foes like Salamence. Bulky Water-types often share strong synergy with Celesteela, checking the Fire-types that power through it, while Celesteela can handle Pokemon like Zarude and Tapu Bulu in return. Swampert and Slowking check both Rotom-H and Moltres, two of Celesteela's more effective answers, while also being helpful against Mamoswine. Slowking can also bring Celesteela in safely with Teleport against foes such as Tapu Bulu and Hydreigon. Nihilego is another good teammate, pivoting in on Pokemon like Moltres and Thundurus-T for Celesteela while appreciating its ability to deal with Ground-types such as Excadrill and Nidoking. Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can also make solid teammates, as they can pivot into threats to Celesteela like Keldeo and Azumarill. They both can absorb Knock Off for Celesteela, and the former can use Knock Off itself to cripple switch-ins to Celesteela like Moltres. Zarude is another phenomonal partner capable of offensively pressuring Slowking better and revenge killing Thundurus-T. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Tentacruel keep Celesteela from being worn down by Stealth Rock.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Autotomize allows Celesteela to outspeed the entire metagame barring Choice Scarf Hydreigon and more easily snowball, setting up on common threats like Hippowdon, Zarude, and Diggersby thanks to its typing. Air Slash lets Celesteela threaten foes like Keldeo, Hydreigon, and Tangrowth with ease. It can also flinch down defensive checks like Moltres and Slowking. Fire Blast provides important coverage against Steel-types like Scizor, Excadrill, and opposing Celesteela. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for its greater accuracy. However, Celesteela wants all the power it can get due to this set's nature as a sweeper. Meteor Beam grants Celesteela an opportunity to bypass Fire-types like Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure. It also deals massive damage to foes like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Salamence, and the Special Attack boost it supplies is often extremely useful in boosting Celesteela's sweeping capabilities. Due to taking two turns, however, it must be used with Power Herb, and Celesteela must watch out for the opponent predicting the attack and bringing in a foe that resists it due to often being restricted to a one-time use. Beast Boost lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack upon netting KOs, giving it great sweeping potential.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive builds, acting as a late-game sweeper that cleans weakened teams. On hyper offense teams, leads like Excadrill and Scolipede can provide entry hazards to wear down checks like Rotom-W and Slowking. Powerful wallbreakers like Azumarill and Keldeo make strong teammates capable of removing foes such as Slowking and Chansey for Celesteela to sweep through late-game. Gyarados alongisde the aformentioned Water-types can pressure Rock- and Fire-types like Nihilego, Rhyperior, and Moltres for Celesteela. Secondary sweepers like Thundurus-T and Nihilego often fit well with offensive Celesteela, helping pressure and overwhelm the likes of Chansey and Slowking.</p>"

  "Necrozma": {
    "overview": "<p>Necrozma is a solid sweeper in UU thanks to its offensive versatility, allowing it to bypass traditional answers like Chansey and Celesteela with its unpredictability. Its Dragon Dance set is a strong sweeper, powering through metagame staples like Slowking and Amoonguss. On the other hand, its Meteor Beam set is equally as potent, allowing it to lure in and slam answers to the Dragon Dance set like Celesteela and Mandibuzz. Its Calm Mind set can utilize its high bulk to act as a sweeper while also blanket checking threats like Scizor. Necrozma's high natural bulk and Prism Armor allow it to set up on many Pokemon like Nihilego and take super effective hits from threats like Cobalion and Scizor. Necrozma also has a solid matchup against common entry hazard removers like Salamence and Tentacruel, letting it act as an offensive Stealth Rock setter capable of supporting its team. However, Necrozma heavily dislikes status from threats like Chansey and Hippowdon, which limits its chance to sweep. Necrozma is also limited by the number of Dark-types in the tier like Zarude, Mandibuzz, and Hydreigon, which can all hinder at least one of its sets. Overreliance on Power Herb on Necrozma's Meteor Beam set makes it hard to pull off a sweep at times with Pokemon like Hydreigon and Slowking being common, while the Dragon Dance set can be worn down it accumulates multiple boosts.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Necrozma can run Expanding Force over Photon Geyser on its Meteor Beam set on Psychic Terrain teams for more devastating damage, but the limited viability of the playstyle and reliance on Terrain being active make Photon Geyser the preferred option. A final option is a Stored Power set with Cosmic Power or Calm Mind to boost Necrozma's stats, but it lacks the dangerous immediate sweeping potential of Necrozma's other sets and can be inconsistent at times.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Zarude can easily revenge kill Necrozma, even at +1 Speed from Dragon Dance. However, if Necrozma uses Autotomize, it can threaten them before they attack. Still, Hydreigon forces Necrozma to conserve its Power Herb as it can take advantage of Meteor Beam requring two turns. Umbreon can tank hits from all sets and cripple it with Toxic. Although it must watch out for Meteor Beam, Mandibuzz can take on Necrozma well.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Chansey and Slowking take on the Meteor Beam set with ease. However, they must watch out for the Dragon Dance set. Celesteela walls the Dragon Dance set and can take a boosted Heat Wave while wearing down Necrozma with Leech Seed, but it can get overwhelmed easily. Hippowdon can take boosted hits, cripple Necrozma with Toxic, and outlast it by healing with Slack Off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status is detrimental to Necrozma's attempts to sweep, so moves like Thunder Wave from Togekiss, Scald from Slowking, and Toxic from Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Chansey greatly hinder it.</p>",

With a Lum Berry, Necrozma can set up on Pokemon like Amoonguss, Rotom-W, and Slowking, which would normally stay in to cripple it with status. Alternatively, since Prism Armor lets Necrozma take weak super effective hits like Knock Off from Nihilego with ease, Necrozma can employ a Weakness Policy to get a huge boost to its Attack. Naughty is the preferred nature, since Necrozma outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame barring Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon after a Dragon Dance and prefers to not lower its Special Attack to boost the power of Heat Wave.</p> <p>Necrozma best fits on offense teams as a late-game cleaner once its answers have been removed. Celesteela is problematic for this particular set, so powerful wallbreakers like Thundurus-T can remove it. Thundurus-T also beats Mandibuzz and helps wear down walls like Hippowdon and Primarina for Necrozma to bypass them more easily. Sticky Web support from Ribombee help offset Necrozma's average Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Zarude after a Dragon Dance. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Excadrill and Cobalion wears down Pokemon like Celesteela and Hatterene.

Since Power Herb is single use, it should be saved until special walls like Chansey and Slowking are gone. Photon Geyser is Necrozma's primary move to power through many Pokemon like Keldeo and Amoonguss. It is also able to ignore abilities like Quagsire's Unaware. Heat Wave melts Steel-types like Scizor and Jirachi as well as Grass-types like Zarude and Tangrowth. It is also Necrozma's most reliable option for damaging Hatterene. Autotomize lets Necrozma boost its Speed to outpace threats like Zarude and Choice Scarf Diggersby. Alternatively, Necrozma can utilize Stealth Rock to act as an entry hazard setter for its team thanks to its good matchup against common entry hazard removers like Salamence and Rotom-H. Modest is the preferred nature to maximize damage output, since after an Autotomize, Necrozma outspeeds the fastest Choice Scarf users. Even if Stealth Rock is chosen, Modest is still preferred, since Necrozma doesn't miss out on many important Speed tiers.</p> <p>This set also fits on offense teams as a powerful late-game sweeper. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Excadrill wears down Pokemon like Celesteela and Hatterene for Necrozma to break through them more easily and allows Necrozma to drop Stealth Rock for Autotomize. Excadrill can also beat special walls like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and cripple Slowking and Mandibuzz with Toxic. Early-game wallbreakers like Belly Drum Azumarill, Swords Dance Scizor, and Nasty Plot Thundurus-T can muscle through special walls like Chansey and Slowking for Necrozma. Cobalion can bring in Necrozma on Pokemon it can set up on like Amoonguss while also threatening Umbreon, Hydreigon, and Chansey for Necrozma.

Moonlight allows Necrozma to sustain itself throughout a match, although its limited PP means it should be used conservatively. Colbur Berry allows Necrozma to take Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Scizor and Zarude and retaliate with a powerful attack. Leftovers is an alternative option that lets Necrozma preserve more longevity as it tries setting up. Even if Necrozma's Colbur Berry gets used up, the given HP and Defense EVs allow it to avoid the 2HKO from Zarude's Darkest Lariat as well as other attacks like Choice Band Zygarde-10%'s Thousdand Arrows. 28 Speed EVs let Necrozma outspeed Skarmory, with the rest put into Special Attack to boost its damage output.</p> <p>This set best fits on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Necrozma acting as a late-game sweeper.

Togekiss also counters these Dark-types and can rid Necrozma of status with Heal Bell. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Nihilego and the aforementioned Cobalion wears down threats like Hydreigon and Primarina. Similarly, entry hazard removers like Salamence, Rotom-W, and Tentacruel are great for keeping Necrozma from getting worn down, allowing it to conserve Moonlight PP when absolutely needed.

Pivots like the previously mentioned Rotom-W and Zarude can bring Necrozma in against Pokemon it can set up on like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Scizor. They both also can shut down Hippowdon. Choice Scarf Hydreigon can revenge kill faster threats to Necrozma like Zarude as well as check Slowking.

  "Toxtricity": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxtricity carries a unique niche in UU as a fearsome Electric-type wallbreaker that isn't shut down by the tier's Grass- and Ground-types. Thanks to Punk Rock and Boomburst, Toxtricity is able to deal heavy damage to walls like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Celesteela and maintain pressure on Pokemon that resist its STAB combination, such as Hippowdon and Swampert. In addition, Toxtricity has a relatively decent defensive typing, allowing it to come in on Iron Head from Jirachi and Close Combat from Cobalion and threaten to 2HKO them. It can also pivot into various passive Pokemon such as Togekiss and Amoonguss. However, Toxtricity is incredibly frail, leaving it with limited opportunities to fire off attacks and enter the field safely, relying on additional pivots to get in. Although Toxtricity's base 75 Speed is enough to outspeed the bulkier threats it is able to deal with, its bulk leaves it prey to revenge killers such as Thundurus-T, Excadrill, Azelf, and Hydreigon. Toxtricity faces stiff competition as an offensive Poison- or Electric-type with Nihilego and Thundurus-T, which offer better coverage and Speed.</p>",

Choice Scarf turns Toxtricity into a revenge killer that is able to outpace threats such as Keldeo and Azelf while still having a Special Attack-boosting nature. Throat Spray is an option on Shift Gear sets, as long as Sludge Bomb or Sludge Wave is used over Drain Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can take Toxtricity’s strongest offensive moves with ease. It can heal itself with Soft-Boiled as Toxtricty switches out, keep momentum with Teleport, and spread status with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can directly counter Toxtricity, comfortably switching into Boomburst and forcing Toxtricity to switch out.

Volt Switch is Toxtricity’s way of generating momentum against threats that Toxtricity cannot break through, like Chansey. Since Overdrive + Boomburst covers the entire UU metagame, Shift Gear can be used to boost Toxtricity's Speed and outrun revenge killers like Azelf. Sleep Talk is another option to absorb Spore from Amoonguss and still function as a wallbreaker. Sludge Wave can be used for immediate KOes on Fairy- and Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu, Hatterene, and Tangrowth, though they all hate taking Boomburst. Sludge Bomb is a viable alternative over Sludge Wave to poison and wear down switch-ins like Hippowdon and Swampert. Silk Scarf amplifies the power of Toxtricity's Boomburst, increasing its spammability and giving it good odds to 2HKO Normal-resistant foes like Skarmory and Cobalion. Air Baloon is an option to take advantage of Hippowdon since Toxtricity is immune to Toxic. Heavy-Duty Boots prevent Toxtricity from being worn down by entry hazards. A Modest nature is preferred to maximize Toxtricity's power against foes like Hippowdon and Cobalion, but a Timid nature can be used to outpace Adamant Gyarados and Mamoswine if needed.</p> <p>Toxtricity fits on offensive teams as an early-game wallbreaker that can break down common defensive cores of Pokemon like Hippowdon, Tangrowth, and Salamence and open up its teammates. Toxtricity appreciates entry hazard support from setters such as Excadrill and Hippowdon to punish and accumulate chip damage on vulnerable checks such as Nihilego. Toxtricity can compliment these entry hazard setters by threatening to 2HKO entry hazard removers like Salamence and Rotom-W. Additionally, Toxtricity appreciates Pokemon that can threaten to KO and force out specially defensive walls. Keldeo is a prime example of a wallbreaker that excels at dealing with Ground-types like Hippowdon and forcing out Chansey thanks to Secret Sword. Pokemon that take on Excadrill and Zygarde-10%, such as Tangrowth, Salamence, and Zarude, make great partners. Zarude’s U-turn, combined with Toxtricity's ability to break its checks like Skarmory and Cobalion, yields another VoltTurn core that Toxtricity benefits from. Slowking can pivot into revenge killers like Azelf, Keldeo, and Noivern and bring Toxtricity in safely with Teleport to freely wallbreak. Late-game cleaners like Azelf and Scizor enjoy Toxtricity removing threats like Mandibuzz and Salamence so they can finish off the enemy team.

Hatterene's STAB moves complement each other brilliantly and, alongside Mystical Fire, give it good matchups against entry hazard setters such as Swampert and Skarmory to block their hazards with Magic Bounce and keep pressure off of its teammates. Hatterene's solid bulk lets it take on threatens that can even hit it super effectively like Scizor. Hatterene's typing, while offensively potent, makes it a Fairy-type that's hit neutrally by Dark-type moves and a Psychic-type weak to Poison. This greatly impedes Hatterene's ability to consistently handle Pokemon such as Hydreigon and makes it unreliable at pressuring Tentacruel and Nihilego. It also struggles to beat Steel-types such as Jirachi and Celesteela if it does not catch them with Mystical Fire on the switch. Without a Calm Mind boost, Hatterene noticeably lacks offensive presence, which can be taken advantage of by wallbreakers such as Diggersby and Choice Specs Primarina. While it does have some good matchups against some hazard setters, it also has poor ones, such as against Hippowdon and Nidoqueen, so it can require prediction to make the most out of Magic Bounce. Excadrill is a hazard setter that not only forces out Hatterene but can completely ignore Magic Bounce thanks to Mold Breaker. Hatterene's dismal Speed tier greatly limits what it can accomplish against offensive teams.</p>",

Hatterene can also be an offensive threat in Trick Room with Life Orb, but this sacrifices a lot of consistency in defensive utility because of its need for Special Attack investment and Life Orb recoil. Assault Vest alongside Nuzzle is an option to make Hatterene more bulky without a boost while still crippling the likes of Jirachi, but it faces stiff competition from Reuniclus, which has more consistent healing with Regenerator and better bulk to handle threats such as Keldeo.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Hatterene's poor Speed, lack of consistent recovery, and reliance on a Calm Mind boost to be a consistent threat makes it easy for Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Diggersby, and Crawdaunt to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Jirachi takes little damage from Hatterene's STAB moves and threatens it back with Iron Head, though it dislikes Mystical Fire. Excadrill and Cobalion similarly take Mystical Fire well and can KO it with Iron Head.

Draining Kiss is mandatory as a powerful recovery tool and is instrumental against Chansey; after three boosts, Draining Kiss + Leftovers will outheal Seismic Toss's damage. Psyshock is useful against opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Primarina, as well as a more immediate weapon against Chansey. Psychic is an alternative option because it OHKOes Amoonguss after one Calm Mind boost instead of two. It also helps Hatterene pressure Quagsire better with Special Defense drops. Mystical Fire is vital to deter Steel-types looking to come in on a Calm Mind or STAB move like Celesteela, Jirachi, and Scizor. Leftovers augments the recovery from Draining Kiss and makes Hatterene harder for Pokemon such as Suicune to wear down.

  "Obstagoon": {
    "overview": "<p>While STAB Facade and Knock Off along with Guts make Obstagoon seem like an appealing choice, it holds no real niche. It is completely outclassed as a Guts user by Conkeldurr, which has much higher Attack, ability to cover nearly the entire metagame in four moveslots, STAB Fighting-type attacks to nail Cobalion — which Obstagoon can't touch — and priority in Mach Punch. Moreover, its middling Speed leaves it outsped by many common foes like Keldeo, Azelf, and Zarude. Even with Rest, Obstagoon is worn down way too quickly from entry hazards, sand damage, its weakness to U-turn, and its own Flame Orb to make use of its increased longevity.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>Facade lets Obstagoon 2HKO many slower defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Hippowdon after Stealth Rock damage. Knock Off slams Normal-resistant foes like Celesteela and Scizor. Rest gives Obstagoon some longevity against defensive teams that try to wear it down with residual damage and Sleep Talk lets it call moves when it's asleep while still being boosted by Guts. Unfortunately, the inconsistency when calling moves can make it tough to use when asleep. Due to Obstagoon's lack of coverage, it gives free set up opportunities to Cobalion, making it very difficult for it to force progress against most teams. Obstagoon can run a set with Close Combat and Switcheroo or Obstruct over RestTalk to remedy its coverage issues and cripple defensive Salamence, but this leaves it far more vulnerable to chip damage than it already was. Conkeldurr's better bulk and coverage make it a much more straightforward Pokemon to use. Obstagoon's higher Speed doesn't justify its far lower damage output as well, killing any viability it has.</p>"

  "Zarude": {
    "overview": "<p>Zarude's great Speed alongside U-turn allows it to be an excellent pivot and revenge killer. Its high Speed enables it to outspeed common Pokemon such as Nihilego, Thundurus-T, and Excadrill, and its good bulk and defensive typing lets it check many dangerous threats such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Hippowdon, while also discouraging Zygarde-10% from spamming Thousand Arrows. The ability to heal status conditions and HP with Jungle Healing can allow Zarude to consistently pivot around defensive Pokemon such as Swampert and Hippowdon. Zarude's ability to synergize with other common pivots like Thundurus-T, Slowking, and Moltres has made it one of the defining components of offensive teams. However, it often struggles to break defensive Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Salamence, due to them resisting Power Whip and taking minimal damage from Darkest Lariat. Many teams naturally fit multiple Grass-type resistant Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Cobalion, and Moltres, leaving Zarude with limited opportunities to use its strongest STAB attack. If it is running Choice Scarf, Zarude can risk being locked into an undesirable move, losing momentum. Flame Body from Moltres and Rocky Helmet from Amoonguss and Cobalion can punish U-turn, forcing momentum to be sacrificed to use Jungle Healing. Zarude's inability to answer threats like Keldeo and Primarina as a Grass-type can strain building at times, limiting its flexibility compared to Tangrowth and Amoonguss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide allows Zarude to OHKO Moltres while also dealing good damage to Salamence. Choice Band allows Zarude to function as a powerful wallbreaker, suprising usual switch-ins like Crobat and Amoonguss with a 2HKO.

A Bulk Up set with Jungle Healing, Acrobatics, and Darkest Lariat allows Zarude to deal heavy damage and potentially tank super effective hits.
