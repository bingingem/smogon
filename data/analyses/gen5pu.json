With access to powerful STAB moves like Solar Beam and Sludge Bomb, perfect coverage with Weather Ball, great Special Attack, and Speed that lets it outrun the entire tier in sun even with a neutral nature, Victreebel can violently carve its way through unprepared teams. However, walls such as Audino and Klang can weather the heat, and priority users such as Purugly can whittle Victreebel down even with Chlorophyll's Speed boost. Victreebel also demands sun to be up; otherwise, it finds itself quickly outclassed by the long list of capable Grass-types in PU.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Solar Beam is Victreebel's most powerful attack and does not have a charge turn while under sun, so it functions as the primary STAB option. Sludge Bomb is a secondary STAB option for threats that resist Grass, such as Flying-types like Natu and Dragon-types like Zweilous. Sun-boosted Weather Ball gives Victreebel coverage for Steel-types like Klang and Bronzor while also hitting Grass-types like Vileplume hard. The last move is recommended to be Sunny Day, so Victreebel can set itself up and sweep. However, if Victreebel finds itself on a dedicated sun team, it can use Hidden Power Ground for additional coverage against Fire- and Poison-types like Monferno and Arbok. Growth is also an option for the fourth moveslot to give Victreebel even more power, but this uses a valuable sun turn, and the extra power is really only of use against particularly bulky teams.</p> <p>The most notable partner for Victreebel is the best weather setter in the format, Volbeat, and together they make the beginnings of a dedicated sun team. Other choices for dedicated sun teams include Onix as a reliable suicide lead that can set up sun for Victreebel and Rapidash as a sun wallbreaker that can break down special walls that Victreebel might struggle with. In general, Zebstrika makes for a good partner that can pivot in Victreebel while checking some key threats like Jumpluff and Klang very well. Sun teams generally cannot afford defensive teammates, but outside of those kinds of teams, teammates like Stunfisk and Tentacool are great at checking offensive threats such as Purugly and Simisear. Monferno is another notable partner, as it is able to get rid of high-value specially defensive walls like Audino, Scraggy, and Zweilous that would wall Victreebel otherwise. One last interesting partner is Weepinbell; while it does not contribute at all to defensive synergy, having what is effectively a slightly weaker second Victreebel makes for an interesting offensive combo that banks on the fact that most teams can barely handle Victreebel by itself.</p>"

Nevertheless, with its ability, Pressure, as well as reliable recovery in Roost, Articuno can be a great defensive asset to teams if it's provided with the proper support like other defensive Pokemon which help cover its weaknesses.</p>",

Substitute prevents status from crippling Articuno; and allows it to stall out threatening low-PP moves such as Head Smash, Stone Edge, and Close Combat from users like Relicanth, Torterra, and Ursaring. Ice Beam helps Articuno not be too passive, threatening an OHKO on Torterra, Jumpluff, and Gabite, as well as 2HKOs on foes like Shiftry, Maractus, Fraxure, and Marowak. Toxic can be useful to stall out most defensive Pokemon if Articuno's team does not provide Toxic Spikes support; it can also be helpful to spread Toxic in conjunction with Pokemon like Bronzor and be a good option when paired with entry hazard setters like Dwebble, Stunfisk, and Torterra. Roar is an alternative that's useful if Articuno has entry hazard support and has value in phazing setup sweepers like Shiftry, Ursaring, and Mawile. Articuno can alternatively use an EV spread with maximum Speed investment, which lets it outspeed the likes of Gabite, Monferno, and Luxray; however, this leaves it more frail.</p> <p>Due to the tier's abundance of entry hazard setters that can hinder Articuno, Natu and Rapid Spin users like Tentacool are very good teammates. In return, Articuno can help wall their checks like Shiftry. Articuno's weaknesses to Fire-, Rock-, and Electric-type moves let it be broken down by Pokemon like Monferno, Rampardos, and Raichu, making other defensive Pokemon that can cover these weaknesses like Frillish, Klang, and Stunfisk appreciated. In return, Articuno can help to wall Pokemon that threaten them like Shiftry, defensive Gabite, and Golduck. Articuno appreciates Heal Bell and Wish users like Audino, which can help offset its Stealth Rock weakness.</p>"

Jumpluff's access to Synthesis gives it the longevity to disrupt foes and pivot around for most of the match. However, Jumpluff's offensive prowess is less impressive and leaves it open to being stopped by common walls like Bronzor, Stunfisk, and even Klang.

With Flying Gem, both the Flying Gem boost and the Acrobatics boost apply at the same time, making the first Acrobatics that Jumpluff uses is extremely strong, while granting every subsequent Acrobatics a consistent 110 Base Power. The last move is a choice between three moves: Encore, Aromatherapy, and Swords Dance. Encore is the preferred option and allows Jumpluff to shut down setup and neutralize walls such as Beheeyem and Bronzor by locking the target into an unthreatening move, which also gives teammates potential turns to set up themselves. Aromatherapy is effective for keeping its teammates healthy by shrugging off common status such as paralysis and poison and doubles down on Jumpluff's longevity as well. Swords Dance is a final option for late-game sweeps; however, Jumpluff finds itself easily stopped by common walls, so this is the least preferred option.</p> <p>Jumpluff is best at home on offense teams that are looking for ways to break stall and stay healthy for scrappier matches. In this sense, Jumpluff is a great teammate for Pokemon such as Monferno that are prone to getting hit with status and appreciate being brought in safely by U-turn. Jumpluff also heavily appreciates a teammate that is able to handle its common counters in Bronzor, Stunfisk, and Klang that Jumpluff commonly faces; Pokemon like Simisear and Marowak are excellent choices for breaking past Jumpluff's counters. Other teammates include Zebstrika, which can make an excellent VoltTurn core with Jumpluff. Jumpluff is also surprisingly able to tank strong boosted hits from Pokemon such as Torterra, so teammates such as Stunfisk appreciate the synergy Jumpluff has to offer. Stunfisk, Frillish, and Klang are also good defensive partners, being able to tank some of the attacks directed at Jumpluff. An important thing to keep in mind about Jumpluff is that it is neither a wall nor a sweeper: Jumpluff is there to come in when it's convenient, perform its support task like Encore, heal if it has to or maybe squeeze a hit in if it can, then get out efficiently.</p>"

Sucker Punch gives Mawile a priority option to make up for its lackluster Speed and potentially KO faster threats like Zebstrika. The last moveslot is dedicated to any of these coverage moves: Ice Punch hits Ground-types like Stunfisk and Torterra, Fire Fang hits Steel-types such as Bronzor and Klang, and Thunder Punch hits Water-types such as Swanna and Frillish. It is also possible to drop Sucker Punch for a second coverage move, but the overall utility of Sucker Punch makes it recommended to keep. The given EVs spread lets Mawile outspeed uninvested Pokemon with base 55 Speed such as Ursaring as well as uninvested Torterra while minimizing Life Orb damage, but a faster or bulkier spread can also be utilized depending on the team.</p> <p>While Mawile is excellent at wallbreaking, it can still be walled depending on its chosen coverage move. If Ice Punch is not chosen, Stunfisk easily walls Mawile, so a partner like Torterra can be great to round out that weakness. If Fire Fang is not chosen, Bronzor and Klang can wall Mawile, so Monferno and Scraggy can make for good partners. If Thunder Punch is not chosen, then Frillish can wall Mawile, making a teammate like Vileplume a strong choice. Pokemon that can sweep after Mawile is done wallbreaking make for a good offensive combo, so sweepers like Huntail and Fraxure make for excellent partners.

Knock Off is recommended for the last moveslot to get rid of common items like Leftovers and Eviolite, crippling Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Klang, but Pain Split can be used to patch up Mawile's lack of consistent recovery thanks to its low base HP. However, Mawile usually gets more opportunities to use Knock Off than it would with Pain Split.</p> <p>Many dedicated defensive cores prefer sturdier Steel-types like Bronzor due to their better longevity, so defensive Mawile tends to find a home on more offensive teams that are looking for a reliable tank and appreciate the disruption of Intimidate and Knock Off that Mawile provides. Mawile is weak to Fire- and Fighting-type moves and worn down notably by entry hazards, so Tentacool is a particularly good option for a partner, while Tentacool also appreciates Mawile tanking physical hits as well. Mawile also is weak to common Ground-type attacks, so Pokemon like Maractus can also make for good partners. Maractus and Tentacool both can also set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes respectively, synergizing with Mawile's ability to force switches very well. Other defensive Pokemon such as Frillish, Vileplume, and even Jumpluff can also make for good teammates by covering Mawile's weaknesses and healing any status conditions and damage it has taken.</p>"

A useful Poison typing allows Arbok to set up on certain would-be threats like Vileplume and Close Combat Monferno. Arbok can also utilize a Choice Scarf to become a revenge killer with interesting utility in the form of Switcheroo while bluffing the much more common Coil set.

The last move is recommended to be Sucker Punch to give Arbok a priority option, but Fire Fang is useful for hitting certain threats like Bronzor. Both abilities help with consistency; Intimidate gives Arbok more opportunities to set up, while Shed Skin lets it shake off status that could cripple it otherwise such as paralysis from Stunfisk and Vileplume. Intimidate is recommended due to its more versatile utility and potential to make Arbok a useful switch-in to threats like Monferno and Simisage. Leftovers is the preferred item to make Arbok harder to KO, let it bank more on Coil's Defense boost, and make switching into the aforementioned threats slightly easier, but the power advantage of Life Orb is high enough that it allows Arbok to hit as if it had an additional Coil already set up. Shuca Berry can be used to mitigate Arbok's Ground weakness, allowing it to live attacks from threats like Stunfisk and Torterra and potentially beat or set up against them.</p> <p>Coil Arbok finds itself on balance and bulky offense teams that want a blanket check to some threats like Monferno that can also threaten walls like Vileplume. As such, Arbok makes for a good teammate to Pokemon that appreciate having those threats taken care of such as Shiftry, Marowak, and Zebstrika. Arbok also appreciates partners that cover its Psychic- and Ground-type weakness such as Scraggy or Torterra. Arbok also really enjoys the entry hazards set by Pokemon such as Rampardos, Torterra, and Dwebble.

Switcheroo gives Arbok's Choice Scarf to common walls that usually beat it like Bronzor, crippling them. The last slot goes largely unused, but there are a few options that are worthwhile after Switcheroo is used: Fire Fang allows Arbok to damage Bronzor after giving it the Choice Scarf, Coil lets Arbok set up, and Sucker Punch can be used to continue revenge killing even after the Choice Scarf is lost. Shed Skin is the preferred ability to have a chance to shake off any unfortunate burns or paralysis that would cripple Arbok otherwise.</p> <p>It is very important to note that while Arbok can adequately fulfill the role of revenge killer with a Choice Scarf, it is the slowest common option for a Choice Scarf user by the tier's standards. As such, the decision to choose Choice Scarf Arbok hinges more on its ability to cripple walls with Switcheroo than anything else. Because of this, teammates like Torterra, Beheeyem, and Monferno that love having Arbok's common checks and counters like Stunfisk and Bronzor crippled are excellent choices for a potential follow-up sweep. Arbok needs a lot of help to fully finish off threats, so entry hazard setters like Dwebble, Stunfisk, and Maractus can be good choices. Pokemon such as Bronzor, Maractus, and Scraggy also make for good partners, as they can take on common Ground- and Psychic-type attacks from Marowak and Beheeyem that are directed at Arbok.

Choice Scarf Dodrio functions as a great late-game cleaner, while Choice Band sets can greatly threaten slower teams and are able to threaten Pokemon like Scraggy even after a few boosts. Unfortunately, Dodrio is incredibly linear, as aside from its STAB attacks, it only sports Pursuit as viable coverage; this means that defensive Pokemon that switch into its attacks such as Klang, Bronzor, and Stunfisk will completely wall Dodrio, while other Pokemon with good defensive stats such as physically defensive Articuno don't mind switching in in a pinch as well. Secondly, Dodrio's main STAB move in Brave Bird causes recoil, which further lessens its already meager longevity when coupled with its weakness to Stealth Rock. Dodrio's dependence on Choice items also makes it extremely prediction reliant, and clicking the wrong move on the wrong turn can turn it into easy setup for the opponent. Finally, while Dodrio's Speed is very good for the tier, it is still slower than Pokemon like Zebstrika and Sneasel, so sets without a Choice Scarf can struggle against these faster foes.</p>",

Only an offensive Mawile set is particularly threatened by Choice Band Dodrio, and even then it can usually switch into one Brave Bird and threaten to do a lot of damage back with Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Bulky Articuno doesn't mind switching into Choice Scarf variants of Dodrio, as it can fire back with super effective STAB attacks. Additionally, Sneasel and Choice Scarf Vanilluxe threaten to outspeed and take out Choice Band Dodrio while also being able to scare off Choice Scarf with their powerful Ice Shards.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zebstrika outspeeds and KOes Choice Band Dodrio, while Choice Scarf Dodrio doesn't always KO Zebstrika with Return. Stunfisk in particular counters Dodrio and can freely switch into it, always threatening to paralyze it with Static or almost KO it with Discharge, while Dodrio's moves do fairly little to it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge killers</strong>: The recoil damage on Dodrio's main STAB move paired with its mediocre bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock leaves it very open to faster Choice Scarf users like Rapidash as well as priority users like Monferno, Shiftry, and Purugly.

Quick Attack is a decently strong priority move to pick off faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rapidash, weather sweepers like Golduck and Shiftry, and other priority users like Monferno. Pursuit is an option to take advantage of the switches that Dodrio forces against Pokemon like Natu, Jumpluff, and Zebstrika that don't appreciate taking strong Brave Birds. Drill Peck is used as a significantly weaker Flying-type STAB move that can still pick off weakened Pokemon without the recoil of Brave Bird. Steel Wing is Dodrio's only real coverage option and has the niche of hitting Rock-types harder, but is hard to justify using over the utility of the other moves. Tangled Feet is the most useable of Dodrio's abilities, giving it an evasion boost if it gets confused. An Adamant nature is preferred for much-needed power, but a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf users such as Swanna and Mr. Mime.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Dodrio functions well as a late-game cleaner, after bulkier Pokemon such as Beheeyem, Mantine, and Frillish have been worn down in range of its attacks. Due to its lack of coverage, Dodrio needs partners that can help deal with the likes of Mawile, Klang, and Stunfisk. Ground-types like Gabite and Torterra fill this role quite nicely while also helping Dodrio against Electric-types such as Zebstrika, and they can also set up Stealth Rock to wear down Dodrio's checks. Dodrio's own susceptibility to Stealth Rock also makes Tentacool and Natu good partners for being able to keep entry hazards off the field, giving Dodrio the ability to switch in more times over longer games.

However, Choice Band Dodrio also appreciates some extra support to handle Zebstrika and Sneasel, since it has no chance of outspeeding them normally. Ground-types like Gabite and Torterra work well to help against Zebstrika, with special mention to Stunfisk, as it doesn't have a 4x weakness to Hidden Power Ice. Ice-type checks such as Monferno and defensive Mawile help to keep Sneasel under control. Pokemon like Stunfisk, Dwebble, or Maractus can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes, which can help make Dodrio's attacks guarantee OHKOs on Pokemon like defensive Beheeyem and Audino.

Pokemon that take advantage of weather such as Victreebel and Golduck can make the most of the weather Volbeat sets. Alternative setters like Relicanth and Onix are good partners for secondary setters that also have light defensive synergy with Volbeat, as Volbeat can take the Ground-type attacks thrown at them while Onix and Relicanth can take the Fire- and Flying-type attacks thrown at Volbeat. It can also work outside of a weather team in a dedicated support role on semi-stall teams, but very few teams have the space to spare for Volbeat and its specific set of tools. Even Pokemon like Jumpluff, which would not usually be considered for a defensive support role, almost always fill Volbeat's role better on teams without weather.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With the combination of Choice Scarf to outrun the entire unboosted metagame and a surprisingly powerful Ice Beam that even notably damages Pokemon that resist it, Vanilluxe makes a niche for itself in PU as a revenge killer and potential sweeper. Unfortunately, the notable lack of good coverage moves, lack of a truly good ability, weaknesses to common priority moves and Stealth Rock, and the fact that Vanilluxe is walled heavily by common Pokemon like Klang keep it from being a premier threat in PU.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Ice Beam has no drawbacks and will be chosen almost all the time, especially since even Pokemon that resist it like Sneasel have the chance to be 2HKOed with entry hazards. The rest of the moveset is dedicated to niche coverage. Hidden Power Ground is the preferred option in the second moveslot for hitting Steel- and Fire-types like Klang and Monferno, while Hidden Power Fire exchanges the coverage on Fire-types for being able to hit Bronzor. Flash Cannon can be used to hit other Ice-types like Articuno, and Frost Breath can pierce through potential Special Defense boosts from Pokemon like Calm Mind Duosion. Weak Armor is the preferred ability for the potential Speed boost and the fact that hail is unviable, but Ice Body can be chosen if the Defense drop from Weak Armor is unappealing. A Modest nature is chosen for the extra power as the Choice Scarf already makes Vanilluxe faster than the entire unboosted metagame.</p> <p>Entry hazards go an exceptionally long way in letting Vanilluxe sweep, very often being the difference between a 3HKO and a 2HKO, so reliable hazard setters like Dwebble and Stunfisk are key teammates. Vanilluxe also hates hazards itself, so hazard control from Pokemon like Tentacool or Natu can help keep Vanilluxe healthy throughout the match. Vanilluxe is commonly walled by Steel-types like Klang and Bronzor, Water-types like Tentacool, and specially defensive walls like Audino, so partners like Marowak, Zebstrika, and Monferno are excellent choices for dealing with those walls. Vanilluxe also appreciates being switched in safely with Klang's Volt Switch and Jumpluff's U-turn. Vanilluxe doesn't offer much in the way of synergy itself, but wallbreakers like Stoutland and Simisear do appreciate Vanilluxe inviting in and weakening down common Steel- and Water-type switch-ins like Mawile and Frillish. Vanilluxe also tends to threaten out or take out certain threats like Vileplume and Stunfisk, so Pokemon that enjoy having those walls taken care of like Zebstrika and Monferno appreciate having it on their team.</p>"

Scald is the preferred STAB option for the added utility of a potential burn, making setup easier and making this set useful beyond sweeping or wallbreaking.

Cloud Nine is useful for turning rain and sun off against the occasional hyper offensive weather teams, letting it outspeed and KO threats like Victreebel.</p> <p>Golduck appreciates being brought in safely via Volt Switch or U-turn, so partners like Zebstrika and Jumpluff are excellent choices that also patch up Golduck's Speed. Paralysis support also goes a long way towards helping Golduck, so teammates like Stunfisk and Clefairy make for excellent picks as well. Golduck is weak to common Electric- and Grass-type attacks from threats like Zebstrika and Simisage, so counters such as Stunfisk and Zweilous can also help Golduck. Lastly, Golduck is great for luring in and weakening Grass-types and other kinds of walls such as Vileplume and Tentacool, so Pokemon that appreciate those walls being gone such as Torterra or Simisear are also good choices for rounding out a team.</p>"

Focus Blast is a strong hit against would-be walls like Scraggy or Audino and a heavier hit on Zweilous than Ice Beam. Encore is also a strong option for the last moveslot, as with a Choice Scarf, Golduck is able to lock common setup sweepers like Huntail, Torterra, and Duosion into an unfavorable move, but it comes at the cost of Golduck having to switch out as well. Cloud Nine is critical for this set, as it lets Choice Scarf Golduck outspeed and revenge kill common weather abusers such as Victreebel and even other Golduck.</p> <p>Golduck tends to get stopped by specially defensive walls such as Klang, Audino, and Zweilous, so wallbreakers like Monferno and Stoutland make for good partners. Golduck also tends to bring in Grass- and Electric-types, so defensive teammates like Bronzor and Stunfisk can allow Golduck to pivot out safely. This set heavily appreciates entry hazards to make revenge killing easier, so Pokemon that can reliably set up Stealth Rock or Spikes such as Marowak and Maractus pair well with Golduck. Choice Scarf Golduck fits well on offensive teams that require a revenge killer that can cover weather teams, so slower offensive Pokemon like Beheeyem and Life Orb Mawile love having Golduck around.</p>"

This allows it to work as a trump card and revenge kill most threats in a pinch. Abra also outspeeds a large portion of the tier, including some important threats like Monferno and Arbok. However, without the Focus Sash, it has paper-thin defenses and its Speed still falls short of outspeeding most of the fastest threats in the tier like Swanna and Zebstrika.</p>",

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<p>The combination of Magic Guard and Focus Sash is critical for this set to function, since it allows Abra to survive all single-hit attacks at least once. Signal Beam gives it excellent coverage to hit threats like Beheeyem and Shiftry, which is cannot hit with just Psychic. Abra has a flexible choice of three good options for the last two moveslots. Thunder Wave is handy for disabling any fast threats like Swanna and Jumpluff that might cause trouble otherwise. Knock Off is great for disrupting foes by getting rid of valuable items like Eviolite from common switch-ins like Bronzor, and with Magic Guard, Abra can actually afford to come in and use Knock Off potentially multiple times in a single match. Alternatively, Encore is good for endlessly forcing support and setup Pokemon into using unfavorable moves such as Duosion and Beheeyem into Calm Mind and Bronzor into Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Abra finds a home on offensive teams that tend to not have enough of a defensive backbone to take on multiple varied threats and therefore need a blanket check to most Pokemon thrown their way. It is unique in that it does not provide much to a team in terms of basic offensive and defensive synergy, but it instead fills its shortcomings in roles. Abra's ability to disable fast threats like Swanna and Simisear by paralyzing them with Thunder Wave or revenge killing them is extremely appreciated by wallbreaking and sweeping teammates like Monferno and Huntail that might be revenge killed otherwise. Abra's ability to further disable walls like Bronzor and Stunfisk with Encore and Knock Off also makes them considerably easier to overcome, which is adored by partners like Torterra and Zebstrika that are walled otherwise. It also desperately wants to avoid taking any unnecessary damage, so partners that can bring it in safely like Klang and Jumpluff are great choices. Common priority users such as Shiftry and Monferno frequently attempt to finish Abra off after its Focus Sash is broken, so switch-ins like Klang and Stunfisk also make for good partners to absorb those attacks.</p>"

On top of that, Machoke is a lot less passive than other walls like Klang; even without investment, Machoke's Dynamic Punch still hurts common threats like Scraggy and Monferno. However, Machoke's lack of common resistances, inability to use Leftovers, and reliance on Rest for recovery cuts deeply into its longevity.</p>",

Machoke also loves entry hazard support, as Dynamic Punch's confusion forces many switches, so teammates like Bronzor and Tentacool that can set entry hazards while patching up Machoke's weaknesses are great choices.

Tentacool also packs important resistances to common offensive types such as Water- and Fire, reliably absorbing those hits with its great Special Defense. However, it is very passive on the topic of damage, it can't reliably heal itself outside of the shaky and uncommon Rest, and its middling Defense leaves it vulnerable to wallbreakers such as Stoutland, Arbok, and Torterra. The final irony of Tentacool is that it's a victim of its own success: its Toxic Spikes are often swept up by the common sight of an opposing Tentacool.</p>",

The last moveslot can be a huge variety of options, with the most common one being Knock Off to eliminate the valuable items of walls such as Klang and Audino. Sludge Bomb can be used as an alternative STAB move that can poison foes, and Hidden Power Electric allows Tentacool to be a much more surefire counter to Water-types such as Swanna. Rest is the last recommended option, since Tentacool cannot heal itself reliably any other way, but the difficulty of BW Sleep makes this option the least popular. This set also invests fully into Special Defense to maximize Tentacool's ability to tank special hits, but more investment into Defense is also a valid option to better checks certain physical threats such as Monferno.</p> <p>Tentacool's entry hazard control prowess is appreciated by just about every Pokemon, but some that come into play a lot or are particularly weak to Stealth Rock,like Zebstrika and Articuno, respectively, appreciate its support more. Tentacool appreciate teammates that can cover its weaknesses to common types like Electric and Ground, such as Stunfisk and Torterra. Tentacool also cannot heal itself, so a partner such as Audino that can pass a Wish can go a long way if your gameplan is based around longer games. Tentacool's passive nature also lets in many slow setup Pokemon such as Duosion and Scraggy, so a Pokemon that can deal with these kinds of sweepers such as Jumpluff is a good idea. Lastly, it is important to play Tentacool with an eye for keeping it around for as long as possible so it can Rapid Spin throughout the match.</p>"

Unown is a solid staple in any team and it will not deceive you. The ability to OHKO Toxicroak with its superior Psychic-type powers will come in handy when you have to face the troublesome rain teams that plague the current metagame. All of the OU powerhouses will, ultimately, fall to Unown's might.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>You could run a Timid nature, but Unown does not need to be fast; remember, it has the superb Hidden Power at its disposal. However, the all-powerful Unown will probably have just one chance to attack before it faints, so it may need the Speed against faster foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Dark-types are mean to Unown and will try to Crunch its feeble body, it's generally a good idea to team it up with bullies such as Conkeldurr or Terrakion, who will gladly take the attack and answer with a brutal, well-thrown Superpower. Lucario, the OU Fighting-type outcast, will gladly help Unown as well with its powerful ExtremeSpeed. The mean Ghost-types of OU, Gengar and Jellicent, as well as the hyped-up but less powerful Psychic-types, Alakazam and Reuniclus, may try to hit Unown with a pesky Shadow Ball. Therefore it is recommended to pair Blissey or Chansey with Unown, as they will gladly take Shadow Ball. Steel-types that can deal with these opponents are also helpful, such as Skarmory and Heatran, as they are friendly towards Unown and respect it enough to protect its life and vanquish its foes. Unown will enjoy any type of support your team can give: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Light Screen, Reflect, and spreading paralysis help it shine and let it do its work. In fact, it's highly recommended that you enact your support before letting Unown unleash its fury because, as they say, you'd be better safe than sorry. Unown might not look like the fittest member of your team, but it is a really solid Pokemon that's remained throughout the years because it's never had to change at all! Unown's great power, coverage and movepool allow it to sweep unprepared teams that are unaware of its might.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Pursuit is the main niche of this set, allowing Banette to trap entry hazard control targets like Tentacool and Natu. The last two moveslots are highly customizable but end up feeling similar. Trick is useful for disabling walls like Bronzor and Audino, but only if Banette has a Choice Band. Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak are both priority options, with Sucker Punch being stronger but Shadow Sneak not having to rely on foes attacking to work. Lastly, Return is a spammable attack with decent power that can hit common Normal-types like Stoutland, Audino, and Ursaring that Banette otherwise can barely touch. While all of the options are interchangeable, the recommended set for most scenarios is Shadow Claw + Pursuit + Trick + Sucker Punch due to having the most utility and power available. Ghost Gem is also a good option for bluffing a Choice Band and hitting hard with Shadow Claw and Shadow Sneak, but it makes Pursuit much weaker. Frisk allows additional scouting that can come in handy, and 44 Speed EVs is just enough to outspeed uninvested foes with base 70 Speed such as Natu, with the rest of the EVs thrown into HP for general bulk.</p> <p>Banette is best utilized as a spinblocker, so teammates that set entry hazards such as Dwebble, Maractus, and Stunfisk are a must. Banette also struggles to break through Normal- and Dark-type walls like Audino and Scraggy, so partners like Monferno and Torterra that can handle them is recommended. Banette also invites in a lot of Dark- and Normal-types, so Pokemon like Klang that can take a hit from those can also be key. Banette also has additional synergy with Fighting-types like Monferno and Machoke due to the fact that it is adept at getting rid of Psychic-types like Duosion and Beheeyem with either its STAB moves or Pursuit, while the Fighting-types beat the Normal-and Dark-types that usually wall Banette.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rampardos is a famous example of a glass cannon, and its role in PU is no different. With sky-high Attack, Mold Breaker, and Stealth Rock, it takes on the role of a suicide lead that specializes in brutally beating down the other lead and entry hazard removal competition. Mold Breaker is what sets Rampardos up to be a strong lead by giving it the ability to negate Sturdy, Magic Bounce, and Levitate. This means that common hazard setters and control options such as Dwebble, Natu, and Bronzor are beaten handily by Rampardos. Even other hazard removal options such as Tentacool are scared out by the threat of Rampardos's incredible Attack. However, its low defenses and Speed mean that it struggles in any other role.</p>",

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Stealth Rock gives Rampardos's teammates strong early-game momentum via entry hazard damage. Head Smash and Stone Edge both work as good STAB options, with Head Smash being the stronger of the two. Its recoil damage breaks Focus Sash early, but it can be used to KO Rampardos after Focus Sash is used to freely switch in a teammate while also being significantly stronger than Stone Edge. Earthquake hits plenty of threats such as Bronzor, Tentacool, and Mawile for incredible damage. Ice Beam is chosen specifically for Torterra as it is 2HKOed even without further investment.</p> <p>Rampardos is most at home on offense and hyper offense teams where its use as a suicide lead is heavily appreciated. It does not need much support as a suicide lead, since its role is to set up Stealth Rock and then do as much damage as possible before fainting. However, it is excellent at drawing in Ground-types and other bulky physical walls like Stunfisk, Bronzor, and Torterra, so partners like Monferno and Gabite heavily appreciate their counters being worn down. Another good option for a partner is Maractus, since it can absorb the Water- and Grass-type attacks thrown at Rampardos and set up Spikes to complement the Stealth Rock that Rampardos sets up.</p>"

Being able to single-handedly wall common threats that are difficult to answer such as Beheeyem, Stoutland, Zebstrika, Torterra, is something that most teams heavily appreciate. However, Bronzor's lack of healing outside of Rest and notable passiveness makeit an occasional momentum sink.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Psywave is Bronzor's only way to do any considerable damage despite its significant unreliability. Toxic builds up chip damage against common foes that can't quickly KO Bronzor such as Torterra and deters Pokemon like Beheeyem from setting up. Rest is a somewhat reliable healing move because many Pokemon fail to 2HKO Bronzor. Stealth Rock is usually preferred for the fourth moveslot, as Bronzor is one of the most reliable setters of it. Alternatively, Sleep Talk helps with Bronzor's passiveness while it's asleep from Rest, but it should only be used on teams with another Stealth Rock setter. The EVs make sure that Bronzor cannot be 2HKOed by a Thunderbolt + Overheat combination from Magnet Zebstrika after Stealth Rock. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 68 Def / 188 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to avoid the aforementioned move combination from Fire Gem Zebstrika, but the significant loss of physical bulk can be costly. Levitate is always chosen as the ability, as avoiding Spikes damage is crucial to keeping Bronzor healthy enough to tank the plethora of hits it is expected to take.</p> <p>Bronzor is weak to Fire-type attacks from the likes of Monferno and Simisear, so Pokemon that resist them such as Frillish, Swanna, and Tentacool make for good partners. Bronzor has a ton of useful resistances to high-value types, such as Ground, Flying, Grass, Psychic, and Ice. These resistances are heavily appreciated by Pokemon that are weak to them such as Stunfisk, Scraggy, Frillish, Machoke, and Zweilous. Clerics, such as Audino and Jumpluff, are excellent for helping Bronzor stay healthy by getting rid of sleep from Rest. Bronzor's passiveness tends to bring in setup threats like Scraggy and Duosion, so teammates like Encore Jumpluff and Roar Zweilous that can shut down those threats are also appreciated. As a final note, Bronzor is a rare Normal-resistant Pokemon that is not weak to Fighting-type moves, making it one of the better switch-ins to Stoutland and therefore a mainstay on bulkier teams.</p>"

With the highest Speed stat in the tier and access to Volt Switch, it finds itself nestled on just about any offensive team. Overheat also allows it to threaten the plethora of Grass-types that can usually switch in to resist its Electric-type attacks. However, Zebstrika does lack power, as it has a mediocre base 80 Special Attack and no way of boosting it outside of items, making it struggle to beat specially defensive Pokemon like Audino and Scraggy. Zebstrika is also fairly one-dimensional, lacking any sort of variability other than the user's choice of Hidden Power and item, meaning that any player should know what to expect from team preview.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Thunderbolt is Zebstrika's primary STAB move, while Volt Switch allows it to quickly pivot out. Overheat, as mentioned above, hits Grass-types like Maractus and Shiftry. Hidden Power Ice allows Zebstrika to hit Ground-types, namely Gabite, Torterra, and Stunfisk. Magnet can be used over Life Orb to help Zebstrika's longevity, but the power loss on Hidden Power Ice is especially notable. Expert Belt is a middle-ground option to keep power on Hidden Power Ice, but it lacks the stronger power on neutral Thunderbolt. Fire Gem gives Zebstrika a one-time boost to Overheat, allowing it to break through would-be checks like Vileplume and Torterra more easily. Lightning Rod is Zebstrika's preferred ability, since it allows it to switch into and check other Electric-types while boosting its Special Attack, though Sap Sipper can be used instead to better check Jumpluff and Simisage and potentially swap into them in a pinch.</p> <p>Zebstrika's Speed is its main draw to be used on offensive teams, so slower and hard-hitting wall-breakers, like Choice Band Torterra, Beheeyem, and even some faster ones like Choice Specs Shiftry, can help greatly weaken teams to the point of Zebstrika being able to clean. Grass- and Water-types, such as the aforementioned Torterra, Maractus, and Swanna, can help handle Ground-types while also appreciating Zebstrika's ability to weaken other Grass- and Water-types with Overheat and Thunderbolt, respectively. Many Choice Scarf Pokemon can still outspeed Zebstrika despite its high Speed, the most common being Golduck, Gabite, and Dodrio. Pokemon that can switch into and check these threats, such as Vileplume, Torterra, and Klang, greatly help Zebstrika. Pokemon with U-turn, like Choice Scarf Monferno, Swoobat, and Purugly, also help form nice momentum cores with Zebstrika.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Audino and Scraggy can easily switch into Zebstrika's attacks and heal the damage off. Even other walls, like specially defensive Vileplume, can take several Overheats with little issue due to the Special Attack drop.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Pokemon and Priority Moves</strong>: No Pokemon in the metagame outspeed Zebstrika naturally, but with its poor bulk, any Pokemon that outspeed it with a Choice Scarf can threaten it, such as Golduck, Mr. Mime, and Gabite. It is also threatened by priority moves from the likes of Shiftry, Purugly, and Monferno.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Any Ground-type prevents Zebstrika from spamming its Volt Switch easily, and Zebstrika is threatened back by their STAB moves. Torterra can sometimes live a Hidden Power Ice depending on its Special Defense investment and whether or not it has a Yache Berry. Stunfisk also can take a Hidden Power Ice pretty easily and threaten to KO Zebstrika in return.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Due to Zebstrika's high Speed and Volt Switch, the main way for most teams to beat it is by whittling it down through passive damage. Stealth Rock and Spikes are both key in this, limiting Zebstrika's opportunities to switch in as much as possible. Status conditions also limit Zebstrika's longevity, so it has to be wary of switching into Pokemon like Klang, Mawile, and Frillish in case it gets hit by Toxic or burned by Scald or Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

  "Swoobat": {
    "overview": "<p>The stars aligned in an interesting way for Swoobat, giving it one of the most unique niches in PU. Swoobat utilizes its Unaware ability to shut down setup threats like Beheeyem and Monferno and 2HKOes most foes by ignoring any defensive stat boosts. Combined with excellent base 114 Speed and great STAB coverage, Swoobat becomes a menace to offense and balance teams alike and, as a result, is an incredible asset to offense teams. However, even with all of this, it can still come up short. Swoobat outspeeds almost all of the tier but fails to outspeed Zebstrika and Sneasel, two threats that shut it down with their STAB attacks. On top of that, Swoobat's low natural Special Attack means that it can struggle greatly against bulkier teams.</p>",

U-turn allows Swoobat to slot effectively into offensive VoltTurn teams. The last slot is versatile and depends on what threats Swoobat needs to shut down for your specific team. Air Slash stops Scraggy from safely setting up, whereas Heat Wave stops Shift Gear Klang. Trick is also an option for shutting down any wall that might try and stop Swoobat, such as Audino or Articuno.</p> <p>Swoobat is an effective anti-setup option for offensive teams, beating setup sweepers such as Beheeyem thanks to Unaware. Swoobat also checks Monferno especially well, as it is one of the few checks that does not fear a boosted Mach Punch. However, despite having Choice Specs, Swoobat is a subpar dedicated wallbreaker. Pairing Swoobat with other wallbreakers such as Choice Band Monferno and Swords Dance Torterra is an excellent decision, as both of those choices threaten common Swoobat counters like Audino, while Swoobat can use U-turn to safely bring them in. Another factor to consider is that Swoobat's Speed is just barely not enough; as such, having priority, a bulky teammate, or a Choice Scarf user to outspeed possible threats like Zebstrika is necessary. Mach Punch Monferno and Stunfisk are potential options. Swoobat also must choose between beating Scraggy or Klang, so having a partner like Swanna or Stunfisk that can threaten what Swoobat can't will also be beneficial. Remember that Swoobat's primary job is to beat setup threats and threaten frail and slower offensive Pokemon, not to wallbreak.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Threats such as Audino and Articuno can consistently[B] [/B]wall Swoobat throughout a match. Even Scraggy and Klang can wall Swoobat if it lacks the proper coverage move. All of these Pokemon do fear the rare Trick, but not enough to dissuade them from coming in whenever Swoobat is out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Swoobat is exceptionally fast, but Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Sneasel are even faster and easily revenge kill it with their STAB moves. Similarly, common Choice Scarf users such as Dodrio and Golduck can also outspeed and prey upon Swoobat. Very[B] [/B]few of these fast threats want to switch into Swoobat directly, but when they are able to come in safely, they easily[B] [/B]force Swoobat out.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Psychic is usually a safe move to lock into, but a Dark-type such as Shiftry or Scraggy can make use of the opportunity to set up or threaten Swoobat.

It is also noteworthy that most offensive users of Sucker Punch, such as Shiftry, can cleanly[B] [/B]KO Swoobat with it after just one round of Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

Audino's last move is dependent on what the rest of the team needs. Heal Bell is the most common, as the ability to rid Audino and its teammates of status is extremely valuable in PU. Encore can lock opposing Pokemon into unfavorable moves, such as setting a redundant entry hazard or forcing a setup Pokemon like Scraggy or Beheeyem to continually set up, which gives Audino's teammates a few turns to respond to that threat. Toxic is by far the least popular option, but can still be handy for racking up chip damage that Audino can struggle to do otherwise.</p> <p>Audino is able to tank many special hits, but can struggle against physical attacks.

In a metagame with very limited removal, having both hazards set up is extremely effective.

Rock Blast threatens out opposing leads that also have Focus Sash or Sturdy such as Rampardos and opposing Dwebble to potentially stop them from setting up their own entry hazards. The last slot is flexible and based on what utility the rest of the team would appreciate most. Toxic and Knock Off can cripple defensive switch-ins such as Stunfisk and Bronzor, respectively, and Shell Smash is effective at threatening out common hazard removal from Tentacool or Natu.

Scraggy's bulk and resistance to Stealth Rock are useful tools that help it check many special attackers like Zebstrika, Beheeyem, and Vanilluxe and set up in front of defensive staples like Stunfisk, Bronzor, Audino, Klang, and Mawile. However, even though Scraggy is a difficult Pokemon to stop once it has boosted a few times and threatens an immense portion of the meta, it can still come up short due to it relying on Shed Skin to decrease its Rest turns, as it is vulnerable to being whittled down while sleeping, leaving it unable to sweep.

However, they have to be careful of being continuously damaged if they lack recovery.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Swanna is able to check Scraggy with its strong Hurricane and access to Roost. Pelipper has the same tools in Hurricane and Roost, but it trades Swanna's power and speed for bulk, allowing it to directly switch into Scraggy more easily. Dodrio can't switch into it directly due to its frailty, but its Brave Bird can OHKO Scraggy. Jumpluff is another offensive check that can't switch in directly because of its lack of recovery and weakness to Stealth Rock, but it can deal with Scraggy with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics or Encore, which prevents Scraggy from snowballing. Choice Specs Swoobat 2HKOs Scraggy with Air Slash; however, it needs to be wary of Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Torterra and Vileplume</strong>: Both of these Grass-types make use of their great physical bulk and access to Swords Dance and consistent recovery to set up alongside and outlast Scraggy.

Crunch is Scraggy's Dark-type STAB move of choice, boasting decent damage output and a way of hitting Fighting resistances at least neutrally. Rest gives it the longevity it needs to accumulate Bulk Up boosts. Shed Skin is the ability of choice as it allows Scraggy to act as a status absorber and potentially wake up sooner after it uses Rest. 20 Speed EVs let it outspeed base 50 Pokemon such as Klang, Audino, and Mawile.</p> <p>Scraggy serves as a great sweeper on stall and balance teams with its great sweeping potential and ability to check to Dark- and Psychic-types.

Scraggy appreciates faster teammates like Choice Scarf Dodrio and Purugly that can pressure some of Scraggy's most common checks. Choice Scarf Dodrio also offensively checks Fighting-types and Vileplume, Pursuit traps Swoobat, which can heavily damage Scraggy with STAB Air Slash, and baits in Steel-types for Scraggy. On the other hand, Purugly can check threats like Swanna with Fake Out and Return while using U-turn to bring Scraggy on the field more easily, as it baits in Steel-types that Scraggy can set up on; furthermore, it isn't weak to Stealth Rock, which affords it more longevity than Dodrio.</p>"

However, Duosion has to watch out for Knock Off, as it relies heavily on its Eviolite to tank hits while setting up, especially if not running Acid Armor. Duosion can also do significant damage without the need to set up with its naturally high Special Attack, making it both an offensive and defensive threat. The immunity to hazards allows Duosion to switch in and take hits more safely, which is very valuable due to the lack of hazard removal in the tier. However, Duosion faces large competition with Beheeyem, which can serve as a bulky setup sweeper without having to rely on Eviolite for bulk, allowing it to hold Leftovers or expand its versatility on offensive sets with items like Choice Specs and Life Orb.

Acid Armor pairs well with Calm Mind while sweeping to better take hits from physical wallbreakers like Rampardos and Stoutland. Signal Beam is also an option, as it gives Duosion a way to hit Dark-types like Shiftry and Zweilous and improves its matchup against opposing Psychic-types like Beheeyem. Before setting up, Duosion can utilize its immunity to hazards throughout the match to switch in against offensive and defensive foes alike such as Monferno and Bronzor, respectively. Passive foes like Maractus and Frillish are great options for Duosion to set up against once threats like Scraggy have been KOed. Fighting-types like Monferno and Machoke are solid teammates, since they can take out Dark-types for Duosion.

Swanna can also boast a strong Choice Scarf set for consistent revenge killing that also resisting the common Mach Punch. However, due to its lack of setup moves and only above-average Special Attack, it can sometimes find itself relying on heavy chip damage or lucky Hurricane confusion in order to break through defensive Pokemon like Klang.

This particular STAB combination is really only fully resisted by the exceedingly rare Chinchou, meaning that Swanna is largely free to spam the appropriate move without much need for coverage.

It loves the help of wallbreakers such as Monferno to help take down common walls such as Klang. Swanna also adds some light defensive utility to teams by resisting Fire, Fighting, and Ground, so Pokemon like Klang and Stunfisk appreciate the additional synergy. SubRoost Swanna is also excellent at stallbreaking threats such as Zweilous, Audino, and Machoke, so Pokemon like Zebstrika that tend to struggle against stall also love having Swanna around.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Surf is the chosen go-to STAB move, as Scald is not as powerful and Hydro Pump is not as consistent for a revenge killer. Ice Beam is for hitting Grass-types such as Vileplume and Maractus, and Hidden Power Electric hits other Water-types, with the most notable being opposing Swanna. The last move is dedicated to a Flying-type STAB move, but the selection is varied. Brave Bird has 100% accuracy and makes Swanna a decent mixed attacker, but it has recoil. Hurricane allows Swanna to run Timid nature and hits harder, but it can miss at crucial times.</p> <p>This set is best suited for more offensive-oriented teams that need a slot dedicated for speed control and revenge killing threats faster than Zebstrika. As such, wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Beheeyem appreciate having Swanna take out potential faster threats such as Monferno and Sneasel. Wallbreakers also have the added benefit of breaking down Swanna's defensive answers to allow a potential sweep later. Choice Scarf Swanna is easily walled by Klang, Frillish, Articuno, Audino, Bronzor, and other defensive Pokemon that can take advantage of it being locked into the wrong move. As a result, Pokemon like Stunfisk and Klang that can provide a safe switch-in when Swanna needs it are appreciated.</p>"

  "Klang": {
    "overview": "<p>Klang is one of the fantastic Steel-type tanks of PU, providing a long list of sought-after resistances to Flying, Grass, and more to plenty of teams of all varieties. When this is combined with Klang's impressive bulk, it stands as one of the sturdiest walls in PU. Klang even has Volt Switch, making it into an effective pivot. Unfortunately, Klang's subpar Attack and reliance on Toxic to deal damage makes it into a particularly passive wall. Klang also can get worn down easily, as it takes full damage from entry hazards and lacks any recovery outside of Rest. Add in Klang's weaknesses to common attacking types like Fighting and Ground from threats like Monferno and Marowak, and it might struggle to stay around for as long as it wants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Klang's singular recovery move is Rest, healing it to full health and getting rid of any status but locking it into two turns of sleep at minimum. Unfortunately, due to to BW's sleep mechanics, the amount of turns Klang has been asleep for resets every time it switches out, so Sleep Talk is also used on the set to alleviate this problem. Volt Switch allows Klang to safely bring in its teammates thanks to its extremely slow Speed. Toxic is used so that Klang can status common switch-ins like Stunfisk and Torterra and rack up damage, while Gear Grind can be used instead with a Careful nature. It is worth noting, however, that Toxic is the more reliable and effective damage source between the two choices.</p> <p>Klang's EV spread allows it to properly take hits from heavy special hitters like Swanna, Beheeyem, and Shiftry. Klang is great for slow pivoting into wallbreakers such as Monferno and Beheeyem safely with Volt Switch. While Klang does have impressive natural bulk, it is still weak to common attacking types like Fighting and Ground. As a result, partners that can take those hits such as Torterra and Frillish are good options. Stunfisk stands out as one of the stronger options for a defensive teammate; it can reliably take on common Klang answers like Monferno and Zebstrika and take physical hits generally well, while Klang can take a lot of the Water- and Ice-type attacks thrown at Stunfisk by threats like Swanna and Vanilluxe. Certain other teammates such as Shiftry and Swanna can also be effective partners for Klang, as they can reliably take on the Ground-types that regularly threaten it such as Marowak or Torterra.</p>"

  "Stunfisk": {
    "overview": "<p>Stunfisk hits the stage of BW PU as one of the best utility walls in the format. Stunfisk's unique typing grants it a useful array of resistances to common attacking types such as Flying, Rock, Poison, and even an immunity to Electric. Stunfisk also has access to Stealth Rock to set for the team, and its ability Static makes any contact moves, especially from Pokemon like Monferno and Stoutland, risky and potentially crippling. Combine all of this with Stunfisk's great bulk and it stands as one of the most solid anchors a team could ask for. Weaknesses to Grass, Ground, and Water do make Stunfisk's job difficult sometimes, especially with Grass-types like Torterra resisting both of Stunfisk's STAB moves for an easy switch in.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Stealth Rock is always a boon and Stunfisk's ability to force switches gives it plenty of opportunities to set it up. Discharge is both for a STAB option and for an additional 30% paralysis chance that can threaten common usually-safe switch-ins like Shiftry and Bronzor. Earth Power is for an additional STAB move to better threaten Zebstrika, Klang, and Arbok. Toxic is used in the fourth slot to spread chip damage on to opposing walls that aren't threatened by Stunfisk's STABS or paralysis, while Thunder Wave can be used to instead spread paralysis to slow foes down for a later sweep by a teammate. Stunfisk's ability should also always be Static, as the combination of Static and Ground typing means that Stunfisk can effectively stop VoltTurn in its tracks.</p> <p>Stunfisk forces out many Pokemon but also invites other threats in such as Ground-types like Torterra and Grass-types like Shiftry. Teammates such as Jumpluff and Monferno can help mitigate Ground- and Grass-types on offensive teams, and other choices like Bronzor and Audino can help on defensive teams. Water-type attacks are also a notable threat to Stunfisk, so partners like Vileplume, Maractus, and Tentacool also make for good partners. Stunfisk is also heavily reliant on just its Leftovers for healing, so clerics and Wish passers such as Aromatherapy Vileplume and Wish Audino can make Stunfisk stay around for a long time. Stunfisk is also excellent at checking threats like Zebstrika and Monferno, so partners such as Swanna and Shiftry always appreciate having Stunfisk around.</p>"
