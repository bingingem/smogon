Spore from Amoonguss can stop Trick Room setups and makes Porygon2 vulnerable to strong attacks such as Close Combat from Urshifu, Moonblast from Flutter Mane, and Sacred Sword from Chien-Pao without being able to heal the damage off with Recover. Amoonguss also underspeeds Porygon2, punishing Trick Room setups, meaning that once Trick Room is set up, Amoonguss can Spore Porygon2 before it attacks, removing its access to recovery and damage. Incineroar pressures Fake Out, which helps stop Trick Room. Additionally, Incineroar can use Knock Off to remove the Eviolite from Porygon2, making it easier to KO.

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Pelipper excels in teams capable of taking advantage of Drizzle while also having sufficient defensive options to switch around to regain control of the weather late-game.</li> <li>Archaludon, with its signature move Electro Shot, works exceptionally well in rain, and it provides a defensive backbone to the team thanks to its immense bulk and ability, capable of switching into threats such as Tyranitar's Rock Slide and Maushold's Population Bomb. It quickly becomes an offensive threat once it starts stacking up Electro Shot boosts in rain.</li> <li>Basculegion-M's ability Swift Swim makes it desirable on rain teams both as an early-game powerhouse with its fast rain-boosted Wave Crash and as a late-game sweeper with Last Respects. Its immense Speed and power help it form a well-rounded balanced core with Archaludon and Pelipper, taking on threats such as Garchomp and Gholdengo, while Pelipper threatens the Grass-types that resists Wave Crash like Amoonguss and Rillaboom with Hurricane.</li> <li>Pelipper struggles against opposing weather setters like Tyranitar, which not only tanks Pelipper's STAB moves in sand but also breaks its Focus Sash with sand chip damage and KOs it with Rock Slide. Archaludon takes advantage of Pelipper's rain to fire off Electro Shots as well as completely walling Pelipper's STAB attacks. Amoonguss is an excellent disruptive option, taking advantage of its bulk to survive attacks like Knock Off from Tyranitar and Draco Meteor from Archaludon and put the aforementioned threats to sleep with Spore. Basculegion-M is a great check against Tyranitar as well, outspeeding and OHKOing it with Wave Crash.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a rain setter, Pelipper is often used to enable Archaludon snowball with Electro Shots while handling threats like Amoonguss with Hurricane. Speed control with Tailwind is desirable due to Archaludon's slow Speed, and it helps tremendously against balance archetypes.</li> <li>Pelipper is often lead with Basculegion-M or Archaludon to immediately take advantage of rain, provided the opposing team lacks a method to change the weather. A more flexible approach would be to lead the weather-reliant Pokemon like Archaludon and prepare Pelipper as a switch-in to swiftly take control of the game with a well-timed weather change. It is pivotal to keep Pelipper intact for late-game weather control, as lack of such could potentially end up severely weakening the board and result in a loss of momentum.</li> <li>Rivaling weather setters like Tyranitar and Alolan Ninetales threaten Pelipper's rain. It's advisable to preserve Pelipper and switch it in to thwart Aurora Veil setups from Alolan Ninetales, while Archaludon or Basculegion-M should take out Tyranitar first. Opposing Archaludon can end up being a powerful threat due to being capable of walling Pelipper while taking advantage of its rain. The ideal option here would be to use Amoonguss to force it to Terastallize into a Grass-type, and then have Pelipper deal a massive amount of damage to it with Hurricane.</li> </ul>",

Both Urshifu formes can pose a threat, depending on Registeel's choice of Tera type. Chien-Pao can threaten heavy damage with Sacred Sword if Registeel has not used Terastallization.

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Setup Volcarona fits well on balance teams, as it requires utility and defensive support to enable it to sweep.</li> <li>Rillaboom is an excellent teammate, as it uses Fake Out to give Volcarona room to set up and sets up Grassy Terrain that augments Volcarona's passive recovery and powers up Giga Drain. Redirectors like Clefable draw attacks away from Volcarona, letting it set up more easily. Intimidate users like Paldean Tauros-W and Incineroar supplement Volcarona's ability to enhance its special bulk by reducing the damage of physical attackers.</li> <li>Kingambit is a common teammate on the balance teams that Volcarona fits on. Assault Vest variants threaten foes like Incineroar, Tyranitar, and Dragapult that Volcarona struggles against.</li> <li>Volcarona, before Terastallizing, hates Water- and Rock-types like Basculegion-M and Tyranitar, so Grass-types like Rillaboom give it leeway against them. Additionally, Volcarona's coverage does not extend to Fire- and Dragon-types like Incineroar and Dragapult; Water-types like Paldean Tauros-W threaten the former, while Fairy-types like Clefable assist against the latter. Primarina fulfills both of these categories. Dragon-types like Dragapult are also able to threaten opposing Dragon-types for Volcarona.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a setup sweeper, Volcarona wants Fake Out support and redirection to give it breathing room to set up. The earlier in the game Volcarona can get set up, the more difficult it will be to remove it from the field, as a boosted Volcarona will be able to stay healthy more easily with its powerful Giga Drain. Intimidate cycling assists in this, as it reinforces Volcarona's physical bulk to complement Quiver Dance, which boosts its special bulk.</li> <li>Volcarona is actually one of the greatest adversaries of rain teams, as with redirection support and Terastallization, it can boost to a level where it takes the special attacks of the rain attackers with ease. From there, its boosted attacks will rip apart these rain attackers and completely deny them the ability to revenge kill it. In these matchups, it's better to avoid using too many attacks on Archaludon, as its Stamina-boosted Body Press will eventually become too strong for Volcarona to handle. Early in the game, Pelipper threatens Volcarona with both of its STAB moves, so redirection will prevent Volcarona from being KOed by Pelipper before it can get set up. Additionally, Swift Swim Basculegion-M is a threat before Volcarona has set up, easily outspeeding and overwhelming it with rain-boosted Water-type attacks.</li> <li>Volcarona lacks coverage to threaten Dragon-types, so the likes of Dragapult and Dragonite can take it on effectively. This extends to Tera Dragon Pokemon like Gholdengo, which gain the ability to resist its attacks. Similarly, Fire-types like Incineroar and Tera Fire users like Rillaboom resist both of its attacks, and they are also immune to burns from Heat Wave and Flame Body. Trick Room teams invalidate Volcarona's Speed boost, though the Special Defense boost enables it to take attacks from the special attackers on these teams. Another useful tactic is to use physical attackers, as it has worse Defense and cannot improve it with Quiver Dance.</li> </ul>",

Covert Cloak lets Volcarona ignore Fake Out to set up or throw out its attacks more freely.

Bulky support Incineroar can also feel passive at times because of its lackluster damage output, especially when it can’t use Parting Shot because of redirection or Taunt. Therefore, offensive Pokemon like Gholdengo and Ursaluna that can take on these threats and make up for Incineroar’s poor damage output are greatly appreciated.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Incineroar is an effective support Pokemon and pivot thanks to Fake Out, Intimidate, and its pivoting moves. This makes Incineroar strongest when it can switch in and slow down threats like Sneasler and Rillaboom.

Incineroar is notably strongest as a lead where it can threaten Fake Out and weaken opposing threats without risking any damage. Against Annihilape and Kingambit however, Incineroar likes to be paired with pieces that force them out before coming in, such as Gholdengo and Ursaluna. Assault Vest Incineroar can afford to stay in and do invaluable damage as an offensive piece occasionally, though it notably has to be a lot more careful against Amoonguss.</li> <li>Incineroar’s biggest weaknesses are Annihilape and Kingambit, as they take advantage of Intimidate and can prove to be dangerous wincons with support. Pelipper and Ursaluna-B also prove troublesome, (AC) as they are powerful attackers unaffected by Intimidate. Incineroar relies on teammates such as the aforementioned Gholdengo and Ursaluna to handle these threats along with Fake Out support. When Incineroar pivots in, it can also lead to a loss of momentum against setup Pokemon that can’t be flinched with Fake Out, such as Bulk Up Annihilape, Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Substitute Ursaluna, so it must be careful when pivoting. Bulky support Incineroar’s damage output can often feel underwhelming, especially against opposing Incineroar.

  "Ursaluna": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Ursaluna mandates Trick Room support, as without it, it is very vulnerable to the vast majority of attackers, which are faster than it. Therefore, tactics that virtually guarantee that Trick Room gets set up are good for Ursaluna teams. Redirection also enables Ursaluna to throw out its powerful attacks.</li> <li>Porygon2 is an excellent partner to Ursaluna, as it can leverage its bulk and Recover to set up Trick Room multiple times in a battle; this lets Ursaluna be a threat throughout the game. It also provides special offense to complement Ursaluna's physical offense. Incineroar is great with Porygon2, as its Fake Out makes it easier for Porygon2 to set up Trick Room, which benefits Ursaluna because it wants Trick Room to be set up. Incineroar can also safely bring in Ursaluna with Parting Shot or U-turn.</li> <li>Ursaluna also fits on Psychic-type spam teams. These teams use Indeedee-F, which has both Follow Me and Trick Room, to enable attackers that can also set up Trick Room like Hatterene and Armarouge. Not only do these teams reliably set up Trick Room, but they also provide powerful special offense to pair with Ursaluna's powerful physical offense.</li> <li>Gholdengo is a common sight on Ursaluna teams, as it handles Archaludon and Fighting-types that scare Ursaluna. Amoonguss fits well on Trick Room teams, as its Rage Powder lets Porygon2 set up Trick Room and Ursaluna attack more freely, and its Spore lets it shut down one foe so that the Ursaluna can target the other more freely. Amoonguss also supports Ursaluna by extending its longevity with Pollen Puff.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Ursaluna is a Trick Room sweeper, and it wants to be positioned on the field such that it can throw out its attacks with as many turns of Trick Room as possible. Getting Trick Room up is a major priority for Ursaluna's teams, so tactics that disrupt this, including Fake Out, Taunt, Imprison, and Trick Room, give more room to deal with the mighty bear.</li> <li>Ursaluna is not concerned with the battle state as long as Trick Room is set; if it is, then Ursaluna provides the most value when using with Facade or Headlong Rush. However, Ursaluna itself doesn't help its partner set up Trick Room, so it is less advisable to lead Ursaluna if the opposing team has the means to disrupt Trick Room. Despite this, Ursaluna wants to enter the battle with as many turns of Trick Room as possible, so aggressive switching or switch moves can be utilized to maximize Ursaluna's threat potential.</li> <li>Rain teams threaten to overwhelm Ursaluna with their boosted Water-type attacks, so weather of its own from the likes of Torkoal and Tyranitar is very useful; alternatively, if Trick Room is set up, Ursaluna can simply run them over itself. Grassy Glide from Rillaboom bypasses Trick Room and threatens Ursaluna greatly; Terrain support or redirection from Indeedee-F neutralizes this threat. Intimidate cycling will weaken Ursaluna greatly, but if it is behind a Substitute, it does not need to fear it. Fighting-types like Sneasler and Gallade are problematic for Ursaluna, but redirection from the likes of Amoonguss and Terastallizing Ghost can mitigate them. Corviknight completely walls Ursaluna's STAB moves, so Ursaluna is reliant on teammates to weaken Corviknight so that it can be dealt with. Certain Pokemon such as Torkoal and Hatterene move before Ursaluna in Trick Room, so they can push damage into Ursaluna before it can respond; however, these are usually only seen on opposing Trick Room teams.</li> </ul>",

Meanwhile, Substitute takes advantage of foes that try and use Protect to passively let Ursaluna wear itself out with burn chip damage and stall out Trick Room turns; it will also block Intimidate once it has been set up.</li> <li>Flame Orb activates Guts and boosts the power of Facade.

Assault Vest on Glimmora is especially effective on Dondozo teams, as the extra longevity helps it spread poison better and stall out even longer, making up for the lowered damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Meteor Beam, Glimmora can utilize its high Special Attack stat and good offensive typing as a damage dealer. Tornadus and Ogerpon-W are good partners; Tornadus provides speed control and can launch powerful Bleakwind Storms into Fighting-types that resist Meteor Beam and Ogerpon-W redirects potential Water- or Ground-type attacks while pressuring threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus. In return, Glimmora can threaten Grass-types, which resists both Ogerpon-W's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glimmora's poor defensive typing, combined with its middling bulk and average Speed, makes Glimmora a glass cannon. Glimmora is weak to many prominent offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Landorus, and Gholdengo. Glimmora also struggles to handle Rock-resistant foes such as Iron Hands, Kingambit, and Urshifu-R. Even then, many of these foes will concede Toxic Spikes while taking out Glimmora; for instance, Urshifu-R will set up both layers of Toxic Spikes if it attacks Glimmora. Amoonguss is another difficult match up, as it absords Toxic Spikes and takes Glimmora's attacks comfortably, while threatening a Spore.</p> </li> </ul>",

Due to its immense bulk, Dondozo is difficult to remove without adequate answers, easily sweeping through entire teams on its own.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo performs best with offensive threats that can break apart teams for it and still function independently without needing to pivot. Examples include Chien-Pao and Dragonite, as well as Tornadus and a sweeper such as Urshifu-S or Flutter Mane. The two cores utilize strong speed control and get off massive damage early, allowing Dondozo to clean up. Glimmora is another excellent partner, as its ability and signature move put foes on a timer, forcing them to burn through Dondozo before fainting to Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo struggles against Pokemon that can ignore its stat boosts, either by neutralizing or bypassing it entirely. Both Urshifu formes and Chien-Pao with Sacred Sword ignore Dondozo's Defense boost, with Chien-Pao both outspeeding and threatening Dondozo if it uses Tera Grass, and Urshifu-S dealing big damage with Wicked Blow and removing Dondozo's ability to stall with Protect. Incineroar and Gouging Fire are able to consistently weaken Dondozo with Breaking Swipe and Intimidate cycling respectively. A combination of Incineroar and Amoonguss is particularly difficult to handle, as Amoonguss can keep Incineroar safe with redirection and Incineroar is free to cycle Parting Shot and Intimidate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dondozo requires much more experience to properly play compared to other sweepers, due to only making plays with one Pokemon for most of the game.

This is because its ability prevents Farigiraf from being taunted by the main Taunt user in the format, Tornadus, and the opponent can no longer use Fake Out to stall out Trick Room turns. Additionally, Armor Tail gives Farigiraf a great matchup against Pokemon that rely on priority like Rillaboom and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p>The different Ogerpon formes are all great partners for Farigiraf, because the redirection means Trick Room is almost guaranteed to go up, while their Grass typing means that Spore is no longer an issue. Ogerpon-W has a great defensive typing and can easily tank most hits it redirects away from Farigiraf, Ogerpon-H hits Amoonguss and the Steel-types that resist Farigiraf's moves, and Ogerpon-C is particularly helpful for redirection due to its Sturdy ability. Rillaboom and Incineroar are also great partners, as Fake Out + Trick Room is a great combination due to the fact that Fake Out prevents both opponents from attacking Farigiraf before Trick Room goes up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Partners that are physically frail or weak to one of the big priority moves like Urshifu-R really enjoy having it as an ally.

Protect is just a generally consistent option, allowing Farigiraf to stick around to provide the team with priority blocking for longer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry is generally preferred, as the extra recovery allows it to live important attack combos such as Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash into Entei's Sacred Fire; however, Safety Goggles is also a valid option, allowing it to ignore Spore from opposing Amoonguss, a common counter to Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Sitrus Berry recovery, Farigiraf can always survive an Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao and a Sword of Ruin-boosted Sacred Fire from Entei.

Both sets enjoy having redirection on their side, including the likes of Clefable, Electabuzz, and Amoonguss, which can easily take in Fighting-type attacks from threats like Annihilape and Sneasler. Swords Dance Kingambit can take advantage of redirection to a greater extent, since this can open windows for setup opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is a really good partner for Kingambit, providing setup opportunities with Fake Out and threatening Ground-types such as the Ursaluna formes. Dark-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar and even opposing Kingambit can be covered by Primarina, which also has great defensive synergy with Kingambit. Sneasler also works at removing Dark-types while also removing Fairy-types and providing another source of Fake Out support for Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit, thanks to its typing, is extremely weak to Fighting-types, including Annihilape, Sneasler, and Flamigo, which prove to be an issue. The aforementioned Amoonguss and Clefable can take in these Fighting-type attacks. Primarina, as mentioned before, has great defensive synergy with Kingambit, taking Fighting- and Fire-type attacks with ease, while Kingambit can cover for it against Grass- and Poison-type attacks.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Kingambit's main role is either a setup sweeper with Swords Dance or a defensive pivot piece with Asssault Vest. Swords Dance Kingambit's main goal is to set up and stay healthy; redirection and Fake Out support are usually necessary in achieving this. With Tera Dark and at +2, it's very easy for Kingambit to pick up momentum quickly and blitz through careless players. Don't be greedy with using Swords Dances, as it's easy for Kingambit to be OHKOed or brought to low health with careful positioning around Sucker Punch, especially in a format with Fighting-type coverage everywhere.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit succeeds as a setup sweeper thanks to its typing, bulk, and on Assault Vest sets, coverage. Its typing has many resistances to top types like Dragon, making Kingambit an amazing counter to Dragapult and Hydreigon. Kingambit's bulk, especially when it's paired with Assault Vest, is really good, allowing Kingambit to withstand hits and potentially turn the tables in a losing late-game position.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dark-resistant Pokemon are a huge issue for Kingambit, easily taking Kowtow Cleave and Sucker Punch even if they're boosted. These Pokemon can be taken care of by partners such as Primarina and Sneasler. Fighting-types, including the likes of Annihilape, can be a massive issue, easily using Kingambit to set up. Sneasler in particular can be a problem, only taking notable damage from Iron Head. Fighting-type coverage moves is also rather prevalent in the metagame, with Pokemon like Low Kick Tyranitar and Body Press Archaludon being common. For this, Ghost-type switch-ins like Dragapult or redirection can be helpful in deterring Fighting-type attacks. Additionally, opposing Sneasler can be picked off by Dragapult. Offensive Fairy-types such as Primarina can scare Kingambit away from Terastallizing into a Dark-type, as Moonblast would otherwise easily chunk Kingambit. Sneasler can easily deal with Fairy-types by hitting them hard with Dire Claw.</p> </li> </ul>",

On top of that, Sucker Punch can cause mind games, with Kingambit potentially just using Kowtow Cleave while forcing a switch with the threat of Sucker Punch.

Iron Head can be used as coverage for Dark-resistant Pokemon like Primarina and Sneasler, but it's generally harder to pilot and use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Black Glasses is used to boost the main two moves on Kingambit, Kowtow Cleave and Sucker Punch. It allows +2 Kowtow Cleave to OHKO Rillaboom outright and Archaludon with Tera Dark as well as letting Kingambit pick off Volcarona with a +2 Sucker Punch. Safety Goggles stops Sucker Punch from getting redirected and negated by Rage Powder, which can be a huge issue for Kingambit.

It prefers partners with Fake Out like Incineroar, Sneasler, and Rillaboom as well as redirection from Pokemon like Amoonguss and Electabuzz in order to let it set up, while Choice Specs Gholdengo pairs best with priority Tailwind setters like Talonflame, Whimsicott, and Murkrow. Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Dragapult also synergize well with Gholdengo, as they can switch into Fire-type attacks like Volcarona's Heat Wave and Incineroar's Flare Blitz, while Gholdengo switches well into the Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks that threaten the aforementioned Dragon-types ands hit Fairy- and Ice-types for super effective damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nasty Plot Gholdengo synergizes well with Pokemon like Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss that can give it turns to set up through Fake Out and Rage Powder. Choice Specs sets prefer partners with speed control options like Tailwind Whimsicott to help them against faster threats like Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gholdengo struggles against Pokemon that resist its STAB combination like Incineroar and Kingambit. Fighting- and Ground-types like Flamigo, Sneasler, Garchomp, and Ursaluna can help against bulky Dark- and Steel-types that resist Make It Rain and Shadow Ball. Garchomp is another threat, as it outspeeds Gholdengo and threatens it before and after Terastalizing with Stomping Tantrum and Dragon Claw, respectively.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Gholdengo's main role is to play as a sweeper. Depending on the set, it can accomplish this either by setting up with Nasty Plot or by removing opposing Steel-resistant Pokemon and then sweeping with Choice Specs-boosted Make It Rain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gholdengo is best used as an early- or late-game threat depending on the opposing team. Gameplay should focus on either removing Pokemon that can resist Make It Rain or using Gholdengo to break a hole in the opposing team and then using another strong offensive threat like Ursaluna to clean up afterwards. Nasty Plot sets are mostly used as an early-game option to take advantage of passive leads. Choice Specs sets can be used at any point in the game due to not needing to set up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit and Incineroar are Gholdengo's biggest checks, as they resist its STAB attacks and can threaten it with super effective damage. Pokemon like Sneasler, Flamigo, and Paldean Tauros-W can threaten the aforementioned checks. Another method is to focus on chipping them down throughout the game before finishing them off with Gholdengo. Both Gholdengo sets struggle with smart switches, as Make It Rain lowers Special Attack, while Shadow Ball being single target leaves Gholdengo open to the other opposing Pokemon's attacks.</p> </li> </ul>",

  "Archaludon": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Assault Vest Archaludon is commonly used on rain-reliant teams, allowing it to use Electro Shot every turn. Rain teams also utilize powerful Water-types such as Basculegion-M, which threatens Ground-types like Ursaluna that threaten Archaludon. Assault Vest Archaludon also appreciates redirection and damage reduction, allowing it to set up freely while gaining boosts from Stamina. Power Herb Archaludon needs to deal as much damage as possible before fainting, so it is best paired with fast or priority-boosted forms of speed control like Whimsicott.</li> <li>When it's used with rain, common partners alongside Archaludon are Pelipper, Basculegion-M and Amoonguss. Pelipper and Basculegion-M cover Archaludon's Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses, while Amoonguss redirects damage with Rage Powder and can heal Archaludon with Pollen Puff. When using the Power Herb set, Archaludon is commonly paired with priority Tailwind users such as Whimsicott and Talonflame, allowing it to attack before its foes can, and it is used on balance teams paired with partners such as Rillaboom and Primarina that threaten Ground- and Fighting-types. Rillaboom can also disrupt opponents with Fake Out as well as healing Archaludon with Grassy Terrain. Incineroar also pairs well with both Archaludon sets, as it can disrupt opponents with Fake Out while providing damage reduction with Intimidate.</li> <li>Before Terastallizing, Archaludon takes severe damage from Ground- and Fighting-types such as Ursaluna and Flamigo. Water- and Grass-type partners such as Pelipper, Primarina, and Rillaboom mitigate the Ground-type weakness, with Pelipper and Primarina also threatening Fighting-types. Archaludon struggles to damage Ghost-types, in particular Gholdengo with its additional Steel typing, so Dark- and Ghost-type partners such as Incineroar and Basculegion-M can threaten them. Haze is another great roadblock to Archaludon. With Primarina being the most common Haze user, Rillaboom can threaten Primarina before it is able to use it.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Archaludon is a sweeper capable of dealing significant damage to most foes after a +1 Special Attack boost from Electro Shot or with Body Press after gaining multiple Defense boosts from Stamina. Archaludon should often be sent out first in order to start setting up early when using the Assault Vest set, and it functions best when it's used on rain teams.</li> <li>The Power Herb set can be used either early- or late-game. It mostly requires speed control through Tailwind in order to deal significant damage before fainting, making this set ideal on hyper offense teams. It can also be slotted onto balance teams that require a powerful special attacker or Steel- and Dragon-type coverage.</li> <li>Ursaluna is a huge check to Archaludon, as it's capable of OHKOing it before it Terastallizes, while Archaludon can't OHKO it back. Archaludon is therefore reliant on partners that can KO or weaken Ursaluna such as Basculegion-M and Incineroar. Gholdengo walls Archaludon, so it relies on partners like Incineroar to survive attacks from Gholdengo and threaten it back. Removing rain prevents Assault Vest Archaludon from freely gaining boosts and attacking with Electro Shot, greatly hindering its setup. This forces Pelipper to be brought back onto the field to reset the weather. Haze also counters Assault Vest Archaludon, severly weakening its damage output and bulk, so partners such as Rillaboom that can KO Haze users like Primarina before they can attack help to mitigate this.</li> </ul>",

    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Gouging Fire is a solid offensive support Pokemon with a good defensive typing. Breaking Swipe and Burning Bulwark give it a great matchup against physical attackers such as Rillaboom and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit is one of the most prominent partners for Gouging Fire, because it prevents Incineroar from crippling Gouging Fire with Intimidate. Ogerpon-W fits well with Gouging Fire as well, as with Follow Me it can protect Gouging Fire from Ground- and Water-type moves, both of which Ogerpon-W resists.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Urshifu formes counter Gouging Fire, since they ignore Burning Bulwark and Breaking Swipe. Incineroar is also a good counter to Gouging Fire, cycling Intimidate and Parting Shot repeatedly until Gouging Fire is a sitting duck. Gouging Fire also struggles against special attackers like Flutter Mane and Landorus, which can hit it for big damage, the latter threatening it for an OHKO.</p> </li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Heat Crash is a reliable way of dealing damage, and because Gouging Fire is so heavy, it will almost always do good damage against most of the metagame. Howl can be used to take advantage of passive playstyles and partially negate Intimidate, and with a Speed Booster Energy, it can support the Kingambit and Ogerpon-W in return.</p> </li> <li> <p>252 HP and 20 Defense EVs allow you to always live two Wicked Blows from Adamant Urshifu-S, and 164 Speed EVs with a Jolly Nature allow you to and outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Chien-Pao once the Booster Energy has been consumed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Grass is a good defensive Tera type for Gouging Fire, as it lets Gouging Fire resist Ground-type moves like Landorus's Earth Power and makes it immune to Spore, which is crucial since Burning Bulwark doesn't Protect Gouging Fire from status moves. Tera Fairy is also a good option as well, as it lets Gouging Fire resist both of Urshifu-S's STAB moves and take neutral damage from the majority of the metagame.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Raging Bolt": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Raging Bolt, with a higher Special Attack than Flutter Mane, massive HP, and good defenses, serves its role as a bulky damage dealer exceptionally well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't let Raging Bolt's middling Speed fool you; its signature move, Thunderclap, prevents it from being an issue in a lot of situations and makes the Tornadus + Urshifu-R matchup virtually trivial. Raging Bolt is also really strong into the Ogerpon formes and Rillaboom, as it resists all of their STAB moves except Ogerpon-C's, unless the Ogerpon-H and Rillaboom are carrying Stomping Tantrum and High Horsepower as coverage, respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raging Bolt pairs insanely well with Rillaboom and Incineroar, as they provide Fake Out pressure for Raging Bolt to take advantage of by lowering the foe's Special Attack or Speed on the Assault Vest set, set up with the Calm Mind set or deal massive damage with the three attacks set. Rillaboom also provides more longevity in Grassy Terrain for Raging Bolt, which can make it immensely difficult to KO. Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R are also excellent partners thanks to dealing with Raging Bolt's worst matchup, Landorus.</p> </li> <li> <p>That said, Raging Bolt does still have bad matchups, one of which is the aforementioned Landorus due to it being able to threaten an OHKO against Raging Bolt with Earth Power. Chien-Pao can also be a tricky matchup, as it can deal massive damage with its Ice-type STAB move and cause mindgames with Sucker Punch. Flutter Mane is able to deal huge damage to Raging Bolt even when it Terastallizes and can very comfortably take unboosted Thunderclaps.</p> </li> </ul>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Electroweb is sometimes run over Thunderbolt for speed control. Volt Switch allows for Raging Bolt to become a bulky pivot and pairs well with Draco Meteor, allowing it to switch out after the Special Attack drop. Snarl weakens opposing special attackers, enabling it to sit on the field for longer and deal damage. Tera Blast gives Raging Bolt a strong option into bulky Dark-types and Fighting-types like Ting-Lu and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assault Vest allows Raging Bolt to fully take advantage of its amazing bulk, letting it sit on the field and tank hit after hit all while dealing respectable damage and disrupting the foe with moves like Snarl and Electroweb.</p> </li> <li> <p>The defensive investment allows Raging Bolt to always survive Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao and Moonblast from Choice Specs Flutter Mane. The Speed investment allows Raging Bolt to outspeed Glimmora and Modest Chi-Yu after an Electroweb. The rest of the EVs were put into offensive investment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Fairy is just an incredibly strong neutral Tera type, especially for a Pokemon with as much bulk as Raging Bolt has, and provides a resistance to Urshifu-S's STAB moves.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thunderclap is a good main STAB move, as it allows Raging Bolt to focus less on Speed and go all out on bulk investment, as it will be able to boost up then hit most foes before they can retaliate.</p> </li> <li> <p>While Dragon Pulse is usually an underwhelming move, it serves as a strong neutral STAB move into Pokemon that resist Electric-type attacks when paired with Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>In some situations, Thunderbolt can be used over Protect, due to Raging Bolt being bulky enough to where Protect isn't mandatory on Calm Mind sets, and for consistency against support Pokémon such as Follow Me Ogerpon-W where Thunderclap would fail.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leftovers is preferred on the Calm Mind set, providing immense longevity with Grassy Terrain from Rillaboom.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Defense EVs with the HP EVs allow Raging Bolt to live Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao. The HP EVs make the HP optimized for Leftovers and Grassy Terrain recovery. The bulk investment ensures that Raging Bolt is able to tank 2 unboosted Moonblasts from Timid Flutter Mane at +1 Special Defense after Leftovers and Grassy Terrain recovery combined with Protect. The Special Defense EVs hit an even number to be optimal for the Calm Mind boost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raging Bolt utilizes Tera Fairy for the resistance to Urshifu-S's STAB moves and neutral matchup against the majority of the metagame.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thunderbolt provides good consistent damage, especially with Tera Electric, while Thunderclap helps make up for Raging Bolt's middling Speed. Draco Meteor is a more powerful option, being able to OHKO Pokémon like Landorus when used with Booster Energy. However, it can be forced to switch out after a Special Attack drop and lose the boost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Booster Energy is a strong option, as boosting Raging Bolt's already huge base Special Attack even further turns it into an absolute nuke. Safety Goggles prevents Amoonguss from redirecting Thunderclaps away from Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Speed investment allows Raging Bolt to outspeed Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao while under Tailwind, allowing it to hit them with its stronger options like Thunderbolt and Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Grass is a good option to not only resist Ground-type moves from Landorus but also ignore Amoonguss's Spore and redirection with Rage Powder without running Safety Goggles. Tera Electric will often be a consistent option for just raw damage output.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Iron Crown": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Crown is an excellent choice for offensive teams looking to take advantage of the powerful move Expanding Force thanks to its well-rounded stats and access to Booster Energy. It performs best against frailer offensive teams consisting of Pokemon that do not resist Expanding Force, such as Tornadus, Landorus, and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it can be used as a sweeper early-game to soften opposing teams, it is usually better to save Iron Crown for the late-game when its checks have been sufficiently weakened for it to sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indeedee-F is by far Iron Crown's best teammate, offering role compression as a Psychic Terrain setter and redirector. Access to Helping Hand also further amplifies its partner's ridiculous damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Crown's best counters are Dark- and Steel-types, namely Incineroar, Kingambit, Archaludon, and Gholdengo, all of which resist both of Iron Crown's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore, Iron Crown appreciates Pokemon that can help remove these threats consistently, such as Landorus, Entei, and Urshifu-R. In return, Iron Crown can pressure opposing Urshifu-R and Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is another noteworthy check, as it is able to safely pivot in and override Psychic Terrain, weakening Expanding Force significantly. Other Pokemon with access to Ice Spinner like Chien-Pao and Dragonite can also be used to remove Psychic Terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane serve as good checks as well, but they have to watch out for Follow Me from Indeedee-F as they are vulnerable to Tachyon Cutter.</p> </li> </ul>",

Focus Blast can be used over Tera Blast to secure the OHKO on Kingambit, but is rather inconsistent and is unable to hit Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p>An alternative spread of 76 HP / 4 Def / 172 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe allows Iron Crown to outspeed Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao thanks to Speed Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p>This set can also be run with a Modest nature to maximize Iron Crown's damage output, at the risk of underspeeding opposing Pokemon in the same Speed tier such as Modest Landorus and both Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul>"
