  "Magmar": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Since Magmarâ€™s primary role is redirection, it pairs best with teammates that can either apply immediate offensive pressure or set up for a potential sweep. Although there are other popular teammates like Gholdengo and Dragonite that work well with it, Magmar has been used mainly on a specific balance composition, consisting of Kingambit, Rillaboom, Sneasler, Primarina, and Dragapult to round out the Fire / Water / Grass core.</li> <li>Kingambit is a great partner for Magmar because it can set up safely with Swords Dance and exert significant offensive pressure. Plus, with priority Sucker Punch, Magmar realistically only needs to buy Kingambit one turn. Similarly, Gholdengo is another great partner for it, safely stacking Nasty Plot boosts and sweeping with Make It Rain. Additionally, Magmar can redirect potential Sucker Punch from an opposing Kingambit and burn it with Will-O-Wisp so Gholdengo doesn't outright lose to Kingambit.</li> <li>Rillaboom synergizes with Magmar by providing coverage for common Water-types like Primarina and Basculegion-M and Ground-types like Ursaluna-B that threaten Magmar. In return, Magmar redirects attacks that threaten Rillaboom, most importantly Dire Claw from Sneasler.</li> <li>Primarina works well with Magmar, as it will safely chip away at foes with Hyper Voice without worrying about Dire Claw, Wood Hammer, or Spore from Sneasler, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss. Magmar also pressures Steel-types like Gholdengo and Assault Vest Kingambit that Primarina has a hard time against.</li> <li>Sneasler puts pressure on many relevant Pokemon, including those that Magmar struggles against, like Archaludon and Primarina. Magmar supports Sneasler by helping it maintain its Focus Sash for longer and focus on its role as a glass cannon. Also acting as a glass cannon, Dragapult appreciates redirection, which allows it to safely spam Dragon Darts and deal large amounts of chip damage to both foes.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Magmar's playstyle is straightforward; it enables its teammates to secure KOs while it tanks the hits. For balance compositions, it's the defensive backbone of the team.</li> <li>Typically, Magmar is better as a lead to safely establish early-game offensive dominance with glass cannons like Sneasler and Dragapult or setup sweepers like Swords Dance Kingambit. Once Magmar has fainted and momentum has been established, you can bring in another offensive threat and clean up.</li> <li>One of the biggest flaws of Magmar is spread damage. While this largely can't be avoided, some of the common spread moves can be mitigated with the proper positioning. For example, Expanding Force in Psychic Terrain can be made single target by a well-timed Rillaboom swap, and Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion can be tanked well by Primarina, which can dish back solid damage. Magmar also struggles against standard Archaludon rain teams. To deal with this, Sneasler, Rillaboom, and Kingambit are solid choices. Sneasler threatens Archaludon with its STAB attacks even if Archaludon Terastallizes, while Rillaboom can handle Basculegion-M effectively. Kingambit pressures everything with boosted Sucker Punch, especially Archaludon before it accumulates too many Stamina boosts.</li> </ul>",

Redirection from Indeedee-F and Electabuzz helps Hisuian Typhlosion attack without having the Base Power of Eruption lowered, though it doesn't help against spread moves. Choice Specs is almost always paired with Prankster Tailwind support, mainly from Whimsicott, that allows Hisuian Typhlosion to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Thanks to its offensive and defensive tools, Porygon2 fits well on balance teams with a Trick Room mode. It benefits from teammates that provide utility, such as Fake Out or redirection, enabling it to set up Trick Room and go on the offensive, as well as teammates that can take advantage of Trick Room.</li> <li>Porygon2 is most commonly paired with Incineroar, which offers Fake Out support to allow Porygon2 to set up Trick Room. It also provides Intimidate and Parting Shot utility, enhancing Porygon2â€™s survivability. Parting Shot is especially valuable, as it allows Incineroar to pivot to a Trick Room sweeper while Porygon2 sets up Trick Room. Additionally, Incineroarâ€™s access to Flare Blitz and Knock Off helps to threaten Pokemon like Gholdengo, which would otherwise wall Porygon2.</li> <li>The preferred Trick Room sweeper for Porygon2 teams is Ursaluna, as it takes full advantage of Trick Room by securing OHKOs on many Pokemon with its Guts boost. This pairing also works well because Porygon2 threatens special damage, while Ursaluna dishes out massive physical damage. Garchomp is another excellent offensive partner for Porygon2 because Garchomp provides a faster-paced, non-Trick Room-dependent offensive option for Porygon2 but with a less explosive damage output than Ursaluna.</li> <li>Amoonguss is a common support partner for Porygon2, taking full advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed and putting foes to sleep with Spore to allow Porygon2 to attack unthreatened. It also provides Rage Powder redirection, enabling Porygon2 to set up Trick Room freely, and Pollen Puff to heal Porygon2, reducing the need for it to constantly use Recover.</li> <li>Gholdengo is a common offensive partner for Porygon2, as it walls Pokemon like non-Throat Chop Sneasler, which can threaten massive damage to Porygon2, and Amoonguss, which can disrupt Porygon2 by putting it to sleep with Spore before it sets up Trick Room or deals much damage. Additionally, the threat of Nasty Plot boosts forces opponents to focus on Gholdengo, potentially allowing Porygon2 to move freely.</li> <li>Flamigo and Sneasler are used on Porygon2 teams, as they threaten Incineroar, which can hinder Porygon2 with Knock Off and Parting Shot, as well as threats like Archaludon, Kingambit, and, in Flamigo's case, Gholdengo with Close Combat. Sneasler has the added benefit of threatening status with Dire Claw and Poison Touch, while Flamigo has Wide Guard utility to protect Porygon2 from moves like Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion and Make It Rain from Gholdengo.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a defensive unit with offensive potential, Porygon2 excels when it is minimally threatened by high-damage moves, such as Close Combat from Sneasler and Choice Specs Tera Fire Eruption from Hisuian Typhlosion. This necessitates pivoting and relying on its teammates to handle major damage dealers, enabling Porygon2 to safely set up Trick Room, heal itself as needed, and retaliate with substantial damage.</li> <li>The optimal strategy for using Porygon2 involves pivoting between Pokemon like Incineroar and Amoonguss until Porygon2 and its partner sweepers like Ursaluna achieve a strong offensive position. This includes cycling Intimidate and Parting Shot with Incineroar to stack stat drops while using Amoonguss's Spore to stop opposing threats. By doing so, you create a window for Porygon2 and its offensive partners to safely attack and capitalize on the advantageous board state.</li> <li>Due to Porygon2's relatively unoppressive presence, it's susceptible to being outpaced offensively, which is largely unavoidable. However, the best way to deal with this is by pivoting between teammates like Incineroar and Amoonguss to cycle Intimidate, use Spore, or provide redirection until Porygon2 and its offensive partner are in a favorable position. As mentioned earlier, Incineroar's Knock Off and Parting Shot significantly impair Porygon2's offensive and defensive capabilities, which is why Pokemon like Garchomp and Flamigo are employed to take down Incineroar. Additionally, cycling Fake Out from Incineroar and Rillaboom can be particularly threatening for Porygon2, as it may allow an opposing Pokemon to set up or chip away at Porygon2, potentially causing it to faint before it can use Recover. This is why Pokemon like Flamigo and Sneasler are often included, as they can threaten common Fake Out users as well as setup threats like Kingambit and Gholdengo.</li> </ul>",

Tera Fairy is used to wall Urshifu and hit it and Raging Bolt for super effective damage. Tera Flying is used to hit Grass- and Fighting-types like Urshifu, Ogerpon, and Rillaboom. Additionally, it makes Porygon2 immune to Earthquake from Ursaluna, giving its partner a valuable spread move. Finally, Tera Ghost is used for an immunity to Fighting-type attacks and Fake Out, as well as giving it the ability to hit Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul>"

Tyranitar appreciates redirection support like Amoonguss and Magmar to handle Fighting-type attacks like Close Combat from Sneasler and works well with Trick Room balance composition due to its mediocre Speed tier.</li> <li>Tyranitar and Gholdengo complement each other, with Gholdengo checking threats such as Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and Archaludon in sand while appreciating Tyranitar's coverage options that handle Fire-types such as Volcarona, Talonflame, and Incineroar that Gholdengo is weak to. Amoonguss is an exceptional support option, redirecting Fighting-type attacks like Close Combat and Drain Punch from Sneasler and Annihilape, respectively. Due to its average Speed tier, Tyranitar excels in both Tailwind and Trick Room. Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 and Sinistcha allow Amoonguss and Tyranitar to take advantage of their lower Speed stat to move before their foes. Meanwhile, Talonflame provides Tailwind to help Tyranitar and its faster partners like Gholdengo move first. Rillaboom checks troublesome Water-types like Basculegion and Primarina while weakening Garchomp's Earthquake and offering passive recovery thanks to its Grassy Terrain.</li> <li>Tyranitar is especially susceptible to Garchomp and Archaludon, lacking the means to outdamage them while being weak to their coverage options like the latter's Body Press.

Tyranitar also immediately threatens offensive Pokemon such as Choice Specs Hisuian Typhlosion or Talonflame and can fill the role of a strong defensive backbone of the team.</li> <li>Tyranitar is a strong lead into offensive strategies, ideally to get rid of Talonflame or Hisuian Typhlosion to help its partners like Gholdengo for late-game dominance. Against rain teams, a well-timed switch-in can force Archaludon to waste a turn charging its Electro Shot while threatening Pelipper with Rock Slide. Additionally, setting up sand early can be useful in breaking Focus Sash on common metagame threats such as Sneasler.

A more flexible approach would be to lead the weather-reliant Pokemon like Archaludon and prepare Pelipper as a switch-in to swiftly take control of the game with a well-timed weather change. It is pivotal to keep Pelipper intact for late-game weather control, as lack of such could potentially end up severely weakening the board and result in a loss of momentum.</li> <li>Rivaling weather setters like Tyranitar and Alolan Ninetales threaten Pelipper's rain. It's advisable to preserve Pelipper and switch it in to thwart Aurora Veil setups from Alolan Ninetales, while Archaludon or Basculegion-M should take out Tyranitar first. Opposing Archaludon can end up being a powerful threat due to being capable of walling Pelipper while taking advantage of its rain. The ideal option here would be to use Amoonguss to force it to Terastallize into a Grass-type, and then have Pelipper deal a massive amount of damage to it with Hurricane.</li> </ul>",

Rillaboom is also troublesome for Garchomp, as Grassy Terrain weakens the damage of Earthquake. Garchomp is very reliant on partners like Talonflame and Dragonite to remove Rillaboom, as it struggles to deal threatening spread damage when Grassy Terrain is active.</li> </ul>",

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Whimsicott generally works well on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its ability to provide speed control and shut down opposing setup threats with Encore. Pokemon that have middling or high Speed tiers and strong offenses pair especially well with Whimsicott. Whimsicott can also work well on sun-centric teams, utilizing its ability to overwrite Pelipper's Drizzle with Sunny Day to maintain speed and weather control.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whimsicott pairs especially well with strong special attackers, namely Hisuian Typhlosion, Glimmora, Power Herb Archaludon, Gholdengo, and Garchomp. Their middling Speed tiers benefit greatly from Tailwind, and Hisuian Typhlosion in particular also appreciates Whimsicott's ability to set sun, boosting its Eruption further while mitigating its Water weakness. Annihilape can be used on some teams that want to employ Beat Up strategies, which can also be effective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whimsicott can struggle into teams that can handle its partner's offensive onslaught or mitigate Whimsicott's Tailwind Speed advantage. However, by changing up Whimsicott's partner, it can break through some defensive cores that may stop one pairing but not the other. For example, while Incineroar may be able to beat Whimsicott and Hisuian Typhlosion, it loses to Meteor Beam Glimmora. Since Whimsicott generally pairs with strong, fast offensive threats, its playstyle is very vunerable to Trick Room, especially teams that have Psychic Terrain, which blocks Whimsicott's Prankster Encore. Due to this, Whimsicott generally likes to pair with Incineroar to shut down Trick Room teams while also allowing Whimsicott's frailer partners to pivot in safely.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Whimsicott exists as a support Pokemon, providing speed control through Prankster Tailwind and amplifying its partner's damage output through Helping Hand or Sunny Day.</li> <li>Whimsicott is almost always a lead Pokemon, with a hard-hitting partner that takes advantage of its Tailwind support. It almost always wants to be clicking Tailwind to gain the Speed advantage immediately, unless it is facing a Trick Room team that can turn that advantage on its head. Against bulkier cores that may not have speed control or care about moving first, Whimsicott may choose to use Helping Hand or Sunny Day to try to break through those cores with its partner's sheer power.</li> <li>Whimsicott is mainly weak to strong priority that can take it out before it can set Tailwind, mainly Tera Normal Extreme Speed from Dragonite and Brave Bird from Talonflame. Pokemon that can stomach many hits and slow down the level of offense coming from Whimsicott's side can also be a problem, since Whimsicott is so frail that it can usually only afford to set Tailwind or Sunny Day once. By choosing certain partners for Whimsicott, this matchup problem can be turned on its head. Pokemon such as Glimmora can beat common counters to Whimsicott, including Talonflame, Dragonite, and Incineroar.

Helping Hand is the preferred last move on Whimsicott for most teams because it provides a damage boost to any of Whimsicott's partners. Sunny Day is used on certain hyper offense teams to boost Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption and provide weather control against Pelipper. Protect is almost always used on Focus Sash sets to block Fake Out without the need to Terastallize into a Ghost-type. Beat Up is specifically used with Annihilape to boost its Rage Fist; this, in conjunction with Tailwind, makes it into a threat as quickly as possible.</li> <li>Covert Cloak is generally preferred on Whimsicott to block the effects of Fake Out, allowing Whimsicott to get Tailwind off without having to run Protect. However, Focus Sash is sometimes used on teams that want Whimsicott's support on the field for longer. Focus Sash also allows Whimsicott to set Tailwind in front of Talonflame, which would otherwise KO Whimsicott before it can set Tailwind with Brave Bird in conjunction with Gale Wings.</li> <li>Tera Water can be used to give Covert Cloak Whimsicott an extra turn on the field against common Pokemon such as Incineroar, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Gholdengo, though it must watch out for Rillaboom's now supereffective priority Grassy Glide. Tera Ghost gives Whimsicott an immunity to common priority moves, namely Fake Out and Extreme Speed and is usually seen on Focus Sash sets, as they are susceptible to Fake Out. Tera Fire offers similar defensive benefits to Tera Water while still resisting Rillaboom's Grassy Glide after Terastallization. However, Tera Fire makes Whimsicott weak to common moves such a as Primarina's Liquid Voice Hyper Voice and Pelipper's Weather Ball under rain.

  "Volcarona": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Setup Volcarona fits well on balance teams, as it requires utility and defensive support to enable it to sweep.</li> <li>Rillaboom is an excellent teammate, as it uses Fake Out to give Volcarona room to set up and sets up Grassy Terrain that augments Volcarona's passive recovery and powers up Giga Drain. Redirectors like Clefable draw attacks away from Volcarona, letting it set up more easily. Intimidate users like Incineroar supplement Volcarona's ability to enhance its special bulk by reducing the damage of physical attackers.</li> <li>Kingambit is a common teammate on the balance teams that Volcarona fits on. Assault Vest variants threaten foes like Incineroar, Tyranitar, and Dragapult that Volcarona struggles against. Another common choice on balance teams is Sneasler, which can threaten Rock-types and Incineroar that stuff Volcarona, and it can use Fake Out to give Volcarona room to set up or Coaching to bolster Volcarona's physical bulk.</li> <li>If Volcarona has not Terastallized into a Fairy-type, it struggles with Dragon-types like Dragonite, so Fairy- and Dragon-types like Clefable and Dragapult can help it with that. Volcarona, before Terastallizing into a Grass- or Dragon-type, hates Water- and Rock-types like Basculegion-M and Tyranitar, so Grass-types like Rillaboom give it leeway against them. Additionally, Volcarona's coverage does not extend to Fire-types like Incineroar; Water-types like Primarina threaten them. Primarina also checks Dragon-types, making it a uniquely good teammate.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>As a setup sweeper, Volcarona wants Fake Out support and redirection to give it breathing room to set up. The earlier in the game Volcarona can get set up, the more difficult it will be to remove it from the field, as a boosted Volcarona will be able to take multiple special attacks. Intimidate cycling assists in this, as it reinforces Volcarona's physical bulk to complement Quiver Dance, which boosts its special bulk.</li> <li>Volcarona is actually one of the greatest adversaries of rain teams, as with redirection support from Electabuzz and Terastallization, it can boost to a level where it takes the special attacks of the rain attackers with ease. From there, its boosted attacks will rip apart these rain attackers and completely deny them the ability to revenge kill it. In these matchups, it's better to avoid using too many attacks on Archaludon, as its Stamina-boosted Body Press will eventually become too strong for Volcarona to handle. Early in the game, Pelipper threatens Volcarona with both of its STAB moves, so redirection will prevent Volcarona from being KOed by Pelipper before it can get set up. Additionally, Swift Swim Basculegion-M is a threat before Volcarona has set up, easily outspeeding and overwhelming it with rain-boosted Water-type attacks.</li> <li>Volcarona lacks coverage to threaten Dragon-types unless it has Terastallized into a Fairy-type, so the likes of Dragapult and Dragonite can take it on effectively. This extends to Tera Dragon Pokemon like Gholdengo, which gain the ability to resist its Fire-type STAB moves. Fairy- and fast Dragon-types like Clefable and Scale Shot Dragonite threaten these Dragon-types. Similarly, Fire-types like Incineroar and Tera Fire users like Rillaboom can deal with both of its attacks, and they are also immune to burns from Heat Wave and Flame Body; Water-types like Primarina can deal with these Pokemon. If Volcarona is not using Tera Grass Giga Drain, then Water- and Rock-types like Primarina and Garganacl give it issues; Grass-types like Rillaboom can assist Volcarona in this vein. Trick Room teams invalidate Volcarona's Speed boost, though the Special Defense boost enables it to take attacks from the special attackers on these teams. Another useful tactic is to use physical attackers, as it has worse Defense and cannot improve it with Quiver Dance, though Volcarona can mitigate this issue with Intimidate support.</li> </ul>",

Tera Blast is used only on Tera Fairy sets, whereas Giga Drain sees play on Tera Grass and Tera Dragon sets.</li> <li>Covert Cloak lets Volcarona ignore Fake Out to set up or throw out its attacks more freely, and it prevents Snarl, Icy Wind, and Dire Claw from impeding its sweep. Leftovers gives Volcarona passive recovery, augmenting the recovery that Giga Drain provides to be at higher HP to survive more attacks.</li> <li>Tera Fairy lets Volcarona bypass Dragon-type attacks like Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Dragonite's Scale Shot and maintain a resistance to Fighting-type attacks like Sneasler's Close Combat. Tera Grass gives Volcarona a resistance to Water- and Electric-type attacks like Basculegion's Wave Crash and Archaludon's Electro Shot, makes it immune to Amoonguss's Spore, and powers up Giga Drain, turning +1 Giga Drain from a 2HKO into an OHKO on Basculegion and doing the same with +2 Giga Drain for Primarina. This additionally lets it restore more HP in the process, making it more likely to sweep games. Tera Dragon gives Volcarona similar defensive benefits and doesn't make it weak to Pelipper's Hurricane, Sneasler's Dire Claw, and Fire-type attacks like Armarouge's Armor Cannon and Incineroar's Flare Blitz, though it becomes weak to Dragon-type attacks like Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Dondozo's Order Up.</li> <li>180 Speed EVs and a Timid nature ensure that Volcarona will outspeed Annihilape, as well as other mid-speed Pokemon like Gholdengo and Archaludon. With 164 Special Attack EVs, Tera Blast Fairy will OHKO offensive Dragapult, as well as maximum HP Annihilape after a Quiver Dance. The bulk investment ensures that Volcarona survives a Tera Normal Blood Moon from Life Orb Ursaluna-B after a Quiver Dance and, after Terastallizing, two Rock Slides from Tyranitar if Leftovers or Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain are in play to neutralize sandstorm damage.</li> <li>Alternatively, Volcarona can lean into its bulk with maximum HP investment, which can benefit from the recovery offered by Giga Drain. After the aforementioned Speed investment to outspeed Annihilape, the rest of the EVs are put into Defense, letting Volcarona survive physical priority moves like Black Glasses Kingambit's Tera Dark Sucker Punch and Choice Band Dragonite's Tera Normal Extreme Speed. Even with minimal Special Defense investment, Volcarona has enough special bulk to survive Pelipper's Hurricane; after a Quiver Dance, it will take a Blood Moon from Tera Normal Life Orb Ursaluna-B or a Choice Scarf Tera Fire Overheat from Hisuian Typhlosion in sun, assuming it hasn't Terastallized into a Grass-type.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Talonflame is most common as the main supportive option on teams that aim to overwhelm the opponent and win quickly, such as hyper offense, where priority speed control in the form of Tailwind is especially valuable. Its most common partner by far is Choice Specs Gholdengo, which, when paired with Covert Cloak Talonflame, prevents Fake Out and makes it difficult to stop a turn one Tailwind + Tera Steel Make it Rain. This duo is also particularly strong with Dondozo and Commander Tatsugiri, softening up teams for Dondozo to clean up in the endgame.</li> <li>Talonflame doesn't particularly need any partners to function well; it instead serves to complement its teammates.</li> <li>Talonflame's main competition is Whimsicott, which doesn't have to worry about about losing access to priority moves thanks to Prankster, as well as having better enabling tools such as Sunny Day for Hisuian Typhlosion and Delphox and Beat Up for Annihilape. Talonflame has more general utility tools with Will-O-Wisp and non-Prankster Taunt, is faster, and can OHKO it first with priority Brave Bird, but it generally isn't as support-oriented as Whimsicott.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Talonflame's biggest strength is immediate turn one pressure. Take advantage of that. You generally always want to be leading Talonflame and setting up Tailwind; going for an attack is risky before Tailwind is up, as you lose Gale Wings and a significant chunk of Talonflame's health. Once Tailwind is up, sacrificing it for a free switch is usually the play. If you have the opportunity for a safe switch, however, take it, as Talonflame's coverage and Speed makes it a great late-game cleaner.</li> <li>The only real reason to use Talonflame over Whimsicott is coverage and damage, functioning almost like a glass cannon with access to priority Tailwind. Flying- and Fire-type coverage is excellent into the metagame, and its Speed means it's always a credible threat. Go for damage whenever possible after setting up Tailwind.</li> <li>The best way to handle Talonflame is to nullify either its damage or priority speed control. Pokemon with Intimidate severely hamper Talonflame's offensive pressure, and even Pokemon like Electabuzz and Primarina that can eat one of its attacks and return back for strong damage are difficult matchups. Alternatively, nullifying its priority or Speed advantage also works well. Priority attacks like Fake Out and Extreme Speed break Gale Wings, with the former often completely preventing Tailwind from being set up on non-Covert Cloak sets. Priority blocking abilities like both Indeedee's Psychic Surge are difficult but not common. Incineroar is likely the biggest pain spot for Talonflame teams, as it walls Gholdengo, can break Gale Wings with Fake Out, and has Intimidate to cripple Talonflame offensively. If you're playing Talonflame, you have to be careful when leading it into Incineroar and Sneasler teams, and usually, it's best to completely leave it behind in matchups against balance teams.</li> </ul>",

Talonflame's high Speed means it's usually not too bothered by Gale Wings breaking. Life Orb and Sharp Beak are two sides of the same coin; they are offensive items to pick up OHKOes on foes that Covert Cloak sets don't at the cost of being vulnerable to Fake Out. Life Orb allows for cleaner OHKOes such as OHKOing Rillaboom regardless of its defensive investment as well as boosting Flare Blitz, while Sharp Beak is an option if you prefer not taking recoil at the cost of damage output, such as only having a 60% chance to OHKO the previously mentioned Rillaboom.</li> <li>The choice of Tera type is mostly dependent on personal preference. Tera Ghost prevents Fake Out, Extreme Speed, and other priority moves from breaking Gale Wings. Tera Flying is used for damage, allowing Sharp Beak and Life Orb sets to cleanly OHKO Amoonguss, as well as some frail neutral types such as Delphox and Hisuian Typhlosion, with Brave Bird. Tera Grass gives a resistance to Water, Electric, and an important immunity to powder attacks; this is used to bypass opposing Rage Powders and Taunt an opposing Trick Room user on turn one.</li> <li>Jolly is usually preferred for outspeeding Adamant Dragapult, Whimsicott, and Sneasler, but Adamant is also viable to maximize damage, allowing it to OHKO Amoonguss without Terastallization on Life Orb sets.</li> <li>The last two moveslots are open to player preference and usually mix and matched, the usual 2 are Flare Blitz and Taunt, giving it an additional STAB move and extra utility, respectively, but Will-O-Wisp and Protect are also viable; the former cripples physical threats like Dondozo, and the latter is generally useful.</li> </ul>"

    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Sylveon's solid natural bulk as well as access to absurd damage from Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice makes it a solid setup sweeper. With its pure Fairy typing, Sylveon boasts a better matchup into Ghost- and Dark-type threats such as Flutter Mane and Urshifu-S than its main Fairy-type competition, Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sylveon appreciates support from Fake Out and Follow Me, allowing it to set up Throat Spray or Calm Mind more easily. Incineroar makes up for Sylveons middling physical bulk with Parting Shot and Intimidate, as well as handling the Steel- and Fire-types that Sylveon struggles against. Ogerpon-W not only provides Follow Me support but similarly to Incineroar is able to handle Steel- and Fire-type attacks safely. Landorus is a great offensive partner, with it and Sylveon covering each other's checks, as well as making up for Sylveon's low initial damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sylveon's biggest issue is that it struggles to find a slot on most teams due to its competition with Flutter Mane, which is more of an immediate threat thanks to its higher single target damage, higher Speed, and Fake Out immunity from its Ghost typing. While Sylveon has use cases thanks to its bulk and pure Fairy typing, Flutter Mane is easier to fit into most compositions and is able to function well with minimal support. Sylveon's middling Speed means it is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by foes, making utilizing its strong setup options difficult.</p> </li> </ul>",

Amoonguss also provides Incineroar with much appreciated healing. In return, Incineroar can handle Gholdengo and switch into Fire-types like Talonflame and Volcarona as well as removing opposing Safety Goggles with Knock Off.</li> <li>Incineroar also works well with Gholdengo, providing Intimidate and Fake Out support to help it set up safely. Gholdengo also takes advantage of Incineroarâ€™s ability to do great damage to Kingambit, considering Gholdengo can blow up Clefable and Sneasler that may attempt to protect Kingambit.</li> <li>Porygon2 and Ursaluna can set up Trick Room and Substitute more easily thanks to Incineroarâ€™s support. Ursaluna can then blow up Pokemon Incineroar struggles to damage like Archaludon and opposing Incineroar.</li> <li>Incineroar can struggle to do its job against Pokemon that threaten it such as Pelipper, the Ursaluna formes, and Annihilape. Bulky support Incineroar can also feel passive at times because of its lackluster damage output, especially when it canâ€™t use Parting Shot because of redirection or Taunt. Therefore, offensive Pokemon like Gholdengo and Ursaluna that can take on these threats and make up for Incineroarâ€™s poor damage output are greatly appreciated.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Incineroar is an effective support Pokemon and pivot thanks to Fake Out, Intimidate, and its pivoting moves. This makes Incineroar strongest when it can switch in and slow down threats like Sneasler and Rillaboom. When using Taunt or Will-O-Wisp, Incineroar can shut down opposing wincons like Porygon2â€™s Trick Room and Kingambit. Rage Powder from Amoonguss makes it easier for Incineroar to pivot in and out.</li> <li>Incineroar is strong throughout the entire game; it's usually preserved throughout the game, as even switching it in is impactful, and a late-game Fake Out can be crucial regardless of how injured Incineroar is. Incineroar is notably strongest as a lead where it can threaten Fake Out and weaken opposing threats without risking any damage. Against Annihilape and Kingambit however, Incineroar likes to be paired with pieces that force them out before coming in, such as Gholdengo and Ursaluna. Assault Vest Incineroar can afford to stay in and do invaluable damage as an offensive piece occasionally, though it notably has to be a lot more careful against Amoonguss.</li> <li>Incineroarâ€™s biggest weaknesses are Annihilape and Kingambit, as they take advantage of Intimidate and can prove to be dangerous wincons with support. Pelipper and Ursaluna-B also prove troublesome, (AC) as they are powerful attackers unaffected by Intimidate. Incineroar relies on teammates such as the aforementioned Gholdengo and Ursaluna to handle these threats along with Fake Out support. When Incineroar pivots in, it can also lead to a loss of momentum against setup Pokemon that canâ€™t be flinched with Fake Out, such as Bulk Up Annihilape, Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Substitute Ursaluna, so it must be careful when pivoting. Bulky support Incineroarâ€™s damage output can often feel underwhelming, especially against opposing Incineroar. Assault Vest Incineroar has a tougher time providing support, notably having more trouble getting setup sweepers into position, since it lacks Parting Shot.

Additionally, Rillaboom offers Fake Out utility and passive Grassy Terrain recovery, benefiting a bulkier attacker like Primarina.</li> <li>Electabuzz is an effective redirector, shielding Primarina from threats like Archaludon and Sneasler while also redirecting Spores from Amoonguss thanks to its Vital Spirit ability and providing speed control with Electroweb. Similarly, Magmar makes a great partner with its access to Vital Spirit and Follow Me. In addition, Magmar resists Rillaboom's Grass-type attacks and can use Will-O-Wisp to compensate for Primarinaâ€™s lower physical bulk.</li> <li>Though Primarina sits in an awkward Speed tier, it can operate on teams with a Trick Room mode such as compositions with Porygon2 and Ursaluna.</li> <li>Kingambit is a strong offensive partner for Primarina. With Primarina's chip damage, Kingambit can more easily secure KOs with Sucker Punch. Additionally, most Kingambit sets include Swords Dance, allowing it to punish passive plays and forcing the opponent to choose between Primarina or Kingambit to target.</li> <li>Gholdengo is another common partner for Primarina, as they effectively cover each other's weaknesses.

For instance, being alongside a redirection Pokemon allows it to unleash substantial chip damage with Hyper Voice. Due to its respectable bulk, Primarina can often continue using Hyper Voice until a PokÃ©mon that poses a significant immediate threat, such as Rillaboom, enters the field.</li> <li>The strategy with Primarina is to wait for the opportunity to establish a strong offensive position. Typically, this involves pivoting it around until it can come in and clean up effectively mid- or late-game.</li> <li>As mentioned earlier, Rillaboom and Archaludon are significant threats; however, Sneasler effectively counters both. When facing opposing Sneasler or setup sweepers like Gholdengo or Volcarona, it's crucial to position Primarina correctlyâ€”either by placing it next to a redirector, so it can attack freely, or by utilizing other Pokemon to apply more immediate pressure.

It sets up Psychic Terrain to prevent Fake Out from disturbing your team's Trick Room setup as well as preventing priority attacks from threatening its partners.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B are common partners for Indeedee-F. Trick Room can help with the speed control both Ursaluna formes need, and Follow Me can protect them from non-spread moves while allowing them to deal Normal-type damage with Blood Moon and Facade and Ground-type damage with Headlong Rush, Earthquake, and Earth Power. Other Trick Room sweepers, such as Hatterene and Torkoal, are the best Trick Room partners for Indeedee-F. Hatterene can threaten the opponent's team with heavy Psychic-type damage from Expanding Force, and Torkoal can threaten heavy Fire-type damage with Eruption, Weather Ball, and Heat Wave. Gallade can threaten Dark-type Pokemon with Sacred Sword and provide Wide Guard support to protect its side of the field from spread moves. Sneasler pairs nicely with Indeedee-F because Sneasler can hold the Psychic Seed, activating its Unburden ability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit will decimate any opposing Indeedee-F. Even if Indeedee-F Terastallizes into a Fairy-type, Kingambit will still do significant amount of damage to it. Therefore, a Fighting-type Pokemon like Sneasler should be used to threaten Kingambit, as it can almost always guarantee a OHKO on Kingambit with Close Combat. Rillaboom is another threat to watch out for, as it can set up Grassy Terrain, which can override the Psychic Terrain that Indeedee-F sets up.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Indeedee-F is a support Pokemon. It redirects attacks with Follow Me, provides speed control with Trick Room, provides important chip damage with Psychic or Dazzling Gleam, and helps partners spam Expanding Force.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indeedee-F is best used early-game. As a lead, it is really good to get a head start at initializing your strategy. Sneasler, Ursaluna-B , and Ursaluna are all common Pokemon to lead alongside Indeedee-F. The Sneasler + Indeedee-F lead doesn't require Trick Room to be utilized and does not require any other setup. The Ursaluna-B + Indeedee-F lead does not have to be in Trick Room, depending on the Speed investment of Ursaluna-B, and it unleashes some of the largest amount of special damage in the metagame. Ursaluna and Indeedee-F have to be in Trick Room and need Ursaluna's Guts boost to be utilized thoroughly. However, this lead provides some of the largest amount of physical damage in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p>The biggest weakness Indeedee-F has to deal with is the move Taunt. Taunt prevents Indeedee-F from setting up Trick Room and doing its job as a supportive Pokemon. The most reliable way to get rid of Taunt is to switch Indeedee-F out. Sometimes, Indeedee-F has to rely on its ally to set up Trick Room instead. Because it is a Trick Room Pokemon, it is vulnerable to being double targeted, which prevents Trick Room from being set up.

Psychic Seed ensures that it takes attacks like Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon better. Rocky Helmet punishes any Pokemon that attack it with contact-making moves or have said attacks redirected to it. Some of these contact moves are Annihilape's Drain Punch and Rage Fist, Rillaboom's Wood Hammer, and Sneasler's Dire Claw and Close Combat. Rocky Helmet also has the ability to break Focus Sashes and threaten any Pokemon that use multi-hit moves, such as Maushold and its Population Bomb.

As a little bonus, it offers a STAB boost to Dazzling Gleam. Tera Grass gives Indeedee-F a resistance to Grass-type moves such as Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Water-type moves such as Basculegion-M's Wave Crash and Pelipper's rain-boosted Weather Ball, which are its partners' most common weaknesses. Tera Grass also provides immunity to Amoonguss's Spore and redirection. However, if Indeedee-F uses Safety Goggles, Tera Grass is not recommended.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Dragapult": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Dragapult is a common attacker on balance teams with bulky redirectors, such as Electabuzz, Magmar, and Clefable. Redirectors are vital, since they assist in keeping Dragapult around for longer, which is especially important because Dragapult is frail and is weak to Sucker Punch from threats such as Kingambit. Additionally, Dragapult appreciates Fake Out support from the likes of Rillaboom, as it gives free turns for Dragapult to get extra attacks off, and it works nicely with Phantom Force, preventing a foe from attacking Dragapult after it lands the attack.</li> <li>Dragapult appreciates partners that can cover its weaknesses offensively or that can reliably switch into its checks; some examples are Sneasler and Primarina. Sneasler is a fast attacker that can outspeed and threaten Dark- and Fairy-types such as Incineroar, Kingambit, and Primarina. Primarina is a slower, bulkier attacker that can switch into attacks easier while still having the ability to OHKO threats such as Incineroar.</li> <li>Dark-types such as Kingambit and Incineroar are the biggest checks to Dragapult, as they can easily shrug off its attacks and threaten it with an OHKO. The aforementioned partners can help against these threats by threatening them and redirecting attacks, buying more time for Dragapult to switch out safely or overwhelm them with strong Dragon-type attacks. Tailwind teams can also be a big problem to Dragapult, as it relies on being faster than its foes and getting lots of damage off before they can move. Partners such as Rillaboom and Kingambit can help against Tailwind teams, since they can attack foes with strong priority moves, stall turns with smart pivoting, and, in Rillaboom's case, use Fake Out.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Dragapult is a sweeper, and it requires a lot of smart positioning to use it to its maximum potential. Dragapult shines in positions where its partners can support it either offensively by threatening its checks or defensively by aiding in its longevity. U-turn is a great tool in this regard, as it allows Dragapult to escape from tricky positions while doing chip damage to a foe.</li> <li>Dragapult utilizes Terastallization to get major damage on enemy Pokemon throughout the course of the game. Dragapult can be utilized early-game to get off powerful Tera Dragon Dragon Darts or Tera Blast Ghost, or it can be utilized late-game to clean the enemy team with Dragon Darts and Phantom Force.</li> <li>Dragapult's biggest weakness is Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, such as Kingambit, Alolan Ninetales, and Incineroar. Dragapult utilizes its partners to help against these threats until they are weakened to a point where Dragapult can finish them off. Priority attacks such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit and forms of speed control, such as Tailwind and Trick Room, are threatening to Dragapult, as it is frail and relies on its high damage output and outspeeding foes. Against priority attacks, Dragapult pivots partners in or utilizes an ally with redirection to take the attacks for it. Against Tailwind and Trick Room teams, Dragapult again uses smart pivots and defensive tools such as Follow Me and Fake Out to stall out turns of Trick Room, allowing it to clean up late-game.</li> </ul>",

  "Ursaluna": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Ursaluna mandates Trick Room support, as without it, it is very vulnerable to the vast majority of attackers, which are faster than it. Therefore, tactics that virtually guarantee that Trick Room gets set up are good for Ursaluna teams. Redirection also enables Ursaluna to throw out its powerful attacks.</li> <li>Porygon2 is an excellent partner to Ursaluna, as it can leverage its bulk and Recover to set up Trick Room multiple times in a battle; this lets Ursaluna be a threat throughout the game. It also provides special offense to complement Ursaluna's physical offense. Incineroar is great with Porygon2, as its Fake Out makes it easier for Porygon2 to set up Trick Room, which benefits Ursaluna because it wants Trick Room to be set up. Incineroar can also safely bring in Ursaluna with Parting Shot or U-turn.</li> <li>Ursaluna also fits on Psychic-type spam teams. These teams use Indeedee-F, which has both Follow Me and Trick Room, to enable attackers that can also set up Trick Room like Hatterene and Armarouge. Not only do these teams reliably set up Trick Room, but they also provide powerful special offense to pair with Ursaluna's powerful physical offense.</li> <li>Gholdengo is a common sight on Ursaluna teams, as it handles Archaludon and Fighting-types that scare Ursaluna. Amoonguss fits well on Trick Room teams, as its Rage Powder lets Porygon2 set up Trick Room and Ursaluna attack more freely, and its Spore lets it shut down one foe so that the Ursaluna can target the other more freely. Amoonguss also supports Ursaluna by extending its longevity with Pollen Puff.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Ursaluna is a Trick Room sweeper, and it wants to be positioned on the field such that it can throw out its attacks with as many turns of Trick Room as possible. Getting Trick Room up is a major priority for Ursaluna's teams, so tactics that disrupt this, including Fake Out, Taunt, Imprison, and Trick Room, give more room to deal with the mighty bear.</li> <li>Ursaluna is not concerned with the battle state as long as Trick Room is set; if it is, then Ursaluna provides the most value when using with Facade or Headlong Rush. However, Ursaluna itself doesn't help its partner set up Trick Room, so it is less advisable to lead Ursaluna if the opposing team has the means to disrupt Trick Room. Despite this, Ursaluna wants to enter the battle with as many turns of Trick Room as possible, so aggressive switching or switch moves can be utilized to maximize Ursaluna's threat potential.</li> <li>Rain teams threaten to overwhelm Ursaluna with their boosted Water-type attacks, so weather of its own from the likes of Torkoal and Tyranitar is very useful; alternatively, if Trick Room is set up, Ursaluna can simply run them over itself. Grassy Glide from Rillaboom bypasses Trick Room and threatens Ursaluna greatly; Terrain support or redirection from Indeedee-F neutralizes this threat. Intimidate cycling will weaken Ursaluna greatly, but if it is behind a Substitute, it does not need to fear it. Fighting-types like Sneasler and Gallade are problematic for Ursaluna, but redirection from the likes of Amoonguss and Terastallizing Ghost can mitigate them. Corviknight completely walls Ursaluna's STAB moves, so Ursaluna is reliant on teammates to weaken Corviknight so that it can be dealt with. Certain Pokemon such as Torkoal and Hatterene move before Ursaluna in Trick Room, so they can push damage into Ursaluna before it can respond; however, these are usually only seen on opposing Trick Room teams.</li> </ul>",

Fake Out can create opportunities for Ursaluna-B to throw out its powerful attacks; redirection does the same.

Dondozo paired with Tatsugiri is a similarly threatening sweeper that picks apart teams weakened by Ursaluna-B. Tailwind setters like Whimsicott and Talonflame allow Ursaluna-B to outspeed and defeat faster, frailer attackers that would otherwise threaten Ursaluna-B.

Indeedee-M, Indeedee-F, and Farigiraf can block Fake Out and Grassy Glide, allowing Ursaluna-B to function in the face of Rillaboom. Fake Out from Incineroar, Rillaboom, and, sometimes, Sneasler gives Ursaluna-B opportunities to isolate an opposing Pokemon to attack.</li> <li>Assault Vest Ursaluna-B is more self-sufficient because it is able to take more hits. However, its damage output is lacking compared to the Life Orb variant, so it wants more offensive teammates to supplement it. Dual screens support reinforces Ursaluna-B's bulk and lets it stick around to output damage longer. Fast sweepers can take advantage of teams that get weakened by Assault Vest Ursaluna-B.</li> <li>Offensive Pokemon make great partners for Assault Vest Ursaluna-B, as they appreciate its ability to take hits and dish out damage in return. Gholdengo handles many of Ursaluna-B's checks like Sneasler and Rillaboom and provides a secondary check to Archaludon. Their combined special attacking output can overwhelm specially bulky foes like Assault Vest Rillaboom. Dragonite similarly takes advantage of Fighting- and Grass-types while also doing so for Water-types like Pelipper and Basculegion and uses the damage that Ursaluna-B spreads on the opposing team to clean up with Scale Shot. Alolan Ninetales cuts off Pelipper's rain, damages Water-types with Freeze-Dry, and can support Ursaluna-B with Aurora Veil, which massively boosts its already solid bulk with Assault Vest. Other dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Klefki can also do so, and they provide additional support in the form of Thunder Wave. Bulk Up Annihilape takes advantage of Sneasler to set up and power through the opposing team; it often gets paired with bulky Maushold, which can redirect opposing attacks away from Ursaluna-B with Follow Me, shut down Amoonguss with Taunt, and bolster Ursaluna-B's bulk with Friend Guard.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Ursaluna-B is mainly an early-game wallbreaker that can weaken opposing teams for its teammates to clean up. Speed control is imperative for it to achieve this function and is especially important for Life Orb Ursaluna-B because it does not have as much bulk. By contrast, Assault Vest Ursaluna-B can take hits and dish out damage, leaning into its bulk to throw out several threatening attacks instead of a few catastrophic ones.</li> <li>Sneasler is the best check to Ursaluna-B, as it outspeeds Ursaluna-B even under Tailwind if Unburden is activated. However, it hates taking any attack, which can be facilitated by setting up Trick Room. Rain teams filled with threatening Water-types like Pelipper and Basculegion give Ursaluna-B no room to attack unless it Terastallizes Water, though doing so leaves it vulnerable to Archaludon's Electro Shot. Under Trick Room or with redirection support, however, Ursaluna-B can rip these teams apart. Assault Vest Ursaluna-B is especially vulnerable to Rillaboom, as it cannot use Protect or Terastallize to escape its Grass-type attacks.

Assault Vest gives Ursaluna-B some additional special bulk to survive attacks from the format's powerful special attackers.</li> <li>Tera Normal is used on Life Orb sets to give Blood Moon the extra power to OHKO bulky foes like Primarina and Assault Vest Rillaboom while strengthening Hyper Voice for devastating spread damage.

This and maximum Special Attack investment maximize the offensive potential of Life Orb Ursaluna-B. However, with some special bulk, Assault Vest Ursaluna-B will survive otherwise devastating special attacks like Life Orb Ursaluna-B's Tera Normal Blood Moon, Choice Specs Gholdengo's Tera Steel Make It Rain, and Life Orb Hatterene's Expanding Force in Psychic Terrain; it also is favored to survive truly absurd attacks like Choice Specs Hisuian Typhlosion's Tera Fire Eruption at maximum power and can guarantee living the move with Tera Water or Vacuum Wave.</li> </ul>"

Focus Sash Sneasler pairs best with both special and physical attackers, while Terrain Seed Sneasler both requires either Rillaboom or an Indeedee forme as a partner and pairs very well with them. Sneasler threatens opposing Grass- and Steel-types that resist Rillaboom's Grass-type attacks and Dark- and Steel-types that can switch into Indeedee-M's Expanding Force.</li> <li>Kingambit and Dragapult both synergize very well with Sneasler. Dragapult enjoys Sneasler threatening Primarina, which is a common switch-in to Dragapult's attacks. Dragapult is also extremely fast, letting it and Sneasler quickly overwhelm foes. Dragapult and Kingambit both benefit from Sneasler being good against opposing Kingambit, as they struggle to hit it.</li> <li>Sneasler's main weakness is Gholdengo, since it is immune to all of Sneasler's attacks if it isn't running Throat Chop and is often paired with Incineroar, which can lower Sneasler's Attack while also switching into Throat Chop. An allied Kingambit can help with this, as it benefits from Intimidate and resists both of Gholdengo's STAB attacks while also hitting it for super effective damage.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Sneasler's main role is to use its good coverage against the metagame and good offensive stats to clear the way for other attackers. Look for situations where an opposing team has limited checks to an offensive Pokemon like Dragapult and attempt to remove these checks with Sneasler.</li> <li>Sneasler works best as an early-game attacker, as it can be lead with Pokemon with weaknesses it can cover, forcing the opponent to be weak against one or the other. Tough matchups for Sneasler can simply be resolved by not bringing it, as it shouldn't be the centerpiece of any team.</li> <li>Sneasler's main counters are bulky Pokemon and Pokemon that it lacks the coverage to hit.

    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Glimmora is a strong offensive threat with access to a good STAB combination and the powerful move Meteor Beam, which, when used with the Power Herb, can melt many targets, such as Assault Vest Entei and Incineroar. With Toxic Debris and signature move Mortal Spin, Glimmora can punish physical attackers and passive play, and, when combined with the threat of Meteor Beam, make it impossible to ignore while also requiring careful positioning to properly handle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glimmora has traditionally fit best on Dondozo teams, as the combination of Toxic Debris and Mortal Spin means your foes almost guaranteed to be afflicted with poison, putting your opponent on a timer. Assault Vest on Glimmora is especially effective on Dondozo teams, as the extra longevity helps it spread poison better and stall out even longer, making up for the lowered damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Meteor Beam, Glimmora can utilize its high Special Attack stat and good offensive typing as a damage dealer. Tornadus and Ogerpon-W are good partners; Tornadus provides speed control and can launch powerful Bleakwind Storms into Fighting-types that resist Meteor Beam and Ogerpon-W redirects potential Water- or Ground-type attacks while pressuring threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus. In return, Glimmora can threaten Grass-types, which resists both Ogerpon-W's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glimmora's poor defensive typing, combined with its middling bulk and average Speed, makes Glimmora a glass cannon. Glimmora is weak to many prominent offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Landorus, and Gholdengo. Glimmora also struggles to handle Rock-resistant foes such as Iron Hands, Kingambit, and Urshifu-R. Even then, many of these foes will concede Toxic Spikes while taking out Glimmora; for instance, Urshifu-R will set up both layers of Toxic Spikes if it attacks Glimmora. Amoonguss is another difficult match up, as it absords Toxic Spikes and takes Glimmora's attacks comfortably, while threatening a Spore.</p> </li> </ul>",

  "Dondozo": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>The sweeper set tends to be strong on hyper offensive teams that can force trades, weakening Dondozo's checks into range of its attacks. Dondozo can also be used to weaken foes early-game, putting the opposing team into range of an alternative late-game sweeper like Gholdengo or Indeedee-M. Spread moves are extremely strong with Dondozo, as they allow it to put an opposing team into range of Dondozo's attacks. Speed control such as Tailwind is also strong with Dondozo, as it allows it to outspeed threats like Sneasler and Dragapult. Meanwhile, bulky Dondozo provides a defensive Water-type that can disrupt foes by putting them to sleep, and it's helpful to enable its setup partners.</li> <li>Tatsugiri-C is a mandatory partner for sweeper Dondozo, as with Commander, it combines with Dondozo to give it a +2 boost to every stat. Talonflame is a strong partner for Dondozo, damaging the Grass-types like Rillaboom and Amoonguss that might give Dondozo issues as well as providing Tailwind speed control that allows it and its team to pick up KOs on Pokemon they would otherwise be slower against, which is beneficial for Dondozo's hyper offense-focused gameplan. Another strong partner is Choice Scarf Annihilape. With Coaching, Annilhilape allows Dondozo to becomes even more threatening than it already is. Indeedee-M and Sneasler are very strong partners for this Dondozo variant as well; the combination of them can apply pressure to some of Dondozo's checks like Primarina, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss as well as applying significant pressure to Incineroar, which could otherwise give Dondozo some trouble, and the Speed boost gained from activating Psychic Seed lets Unburden Sneasler become the fastest Pokemon in the metagame, allowing it to provide significant pressure and make room for a Dondozo win later in the game.</li> <li>Common partners for support Dondozo include bulky setup Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona, which tend to struggle against Fire-types, which Dondozo can beat, and in turn, they resist Grass-type attacks for Dondozo and appreciate the free turns Dondozo can generate with Yawn in order to setup. Rillaboom is another strong partner for this Dondozo set, allowing it to get free turns to use Yawn with Fake Out, providing Dondozo with Grassy Terrain to boost its longevity even further, and switching into Grass-types that are used to check Dondozo, such as opposing Rillaboom and Amoonguss. Dondozo also helps Rillaboom in matchups against Fire-types, which often give it trouble. Dondozo also appreciates being paired with Follow Me users like Magmar and Electabuzz, as they can redirect Spore from Amoonguss, hamper it with Taunt, or, in Magmar's case, threaten it with a super effective Overheat. They also help to redirect attacks that Dondozo doesn't want to take, like Electro Shot from Archaludon and Wood Hammer from Rillaboom.</li> <li>Sweeper Dondozo has a lot of trouble with Haze Primarina and Clear Smog Amoonguss, which threaten to remove its stat boosts and make it a sitting duck. Because of this, many of Dondozo's partners, like Talonflame and Sneasler, are tasked with pressuring them early-game so that they do not have an opportunity to get rid of Dondozo's stat boosts. The pivoting core of Incineroar and Amoonguss also causes Dondozo some issues, as Amoonguss can put Dondozo to sleep with Spore, and Incineroar can use Intimidate and Parting Shot to drop Dondozo's Attack greatly. Pokemon like Choice Scarf Annihilape and Indeedee-M can help solve this issue, as Annihilape can use Final Gambit to remove a defensive piece on teams using Incineroar + Amoonguss such as Porygon2 while being able to OHKO Incineroar with Close Combat and boost off Intimidate via Defiant, while Indeedee-M immediately pressures Amoonguss with Expanding Force and blocks Fake Out from Incineroar with Psychic Terrain, making it easier for Dondozo to knock out Incineroar with a super effective Wave Crash.</li> <li>Bulky Dondozo is checked by Pokemon that can hit it for super effective damage, like Rillaboom and Archaludon, or give it trouble by switching around it and hindering it with status or stat drops, such as Amoonguss, Incineroar, and other supportive Dondozo. Electabuzz and Magmar are other checks to Dondozo, as they are immune to Yawn with Vital Spirit and can allow room for a partner to pressure Dondozo with Follow Me; additionally, Magmar can burn Dondozo with Will-O-Wisp, and Electabuzz can hit it super effectively with Thunderbolt. Your own forms of redirection, such as Electabuzz and Magmar, as well as some Pokemon that naturally threaten Grass-types, like Sneasler, Volcarona, and Baxcalibur, all make for great partners to Dondozo. Kingambit also helps deter Intimidate from Incineroar and can use Rillaboom to set up Swords Dance and sweep. Gholdengo can also set up on Rillaboom while naturally being immune to Spore thanks to Good As Gold.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Commander-boosted Dondozo's main job is to act as either a wallbreaker or a sweeper, depending on the situation. Dondozo can often win the game on the spot if placed in the right position, so choosing when to combine Dondozo with Tatsugiri-C is critical. Dondozo can often be used to weaken an opposing team to the point where its partners, like Indeedee-M, can clean up the game; conversely, Dondozo's teammates can weaken the opposition to the point where it can clean up the game with its powerful boosted attacks. Meanwhile, bulky Dondozo's main role is to act as a bulky support Pokemon that can force switches with Yawn, putting its foes in awkward positions by forcing them to either switch out or fall asleep, which allows room for Dondozo's partners, such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona, to set up and threaten the opponent. This is often accomplished by bringing in Dondozo against foes that it walls and using Yawn on them.</li> <li>Sweeper Dondozo teams often involve making smart early-game trades and identifying whether a threat is important to keep alive after Dondozo comes in and goes down or whether it is more important for it to do damage or KO a threat to Dondozo, allowing it to get a late-game sweep. It is also important to identify when Tatsugiri-C should come in to combine with Dondozo, as once this is done, they are fully committed and can no longer switch, making Dondozo vulnerable to being played around and answered. Dondozo should come in once enough damage has been done to the enemy team or in order to deal damage to the opposing team to allow a late-game cleanup from one of Dondozo's partners. Meanwhile, bulky Dondozo is strong both early-game and late-game, depending on the situation. Dondozo tends to use Yawn for a lot of the game, and its high bulk allows it to stick around for many turns at a time. Dondozo can also be used to provide important chip damage against foes that may threaten its partners, such as Incineroar and Volcarona, which gives Dondozo's setup partners more room to break through them. Dondozo can also force opposing setup threats, such as Kingambit, Volcarona, and Archaludon, to switch out, which makes room for its own setup ally to get in the game and threaten a sweep.</li> <li>Sweeper Dondozo is checked by every form of Amoonguss, especially Clear Smog Amoonguss, as well as Haze Primarina. Forcing early-game trades to force these pieces on the board followed by dealing significant damage to them to clean up with Dondozo is important. It is also important to understand that Dondozo should not come in every matchup, as it is just too hard to get value with Dondozo in many of them. It is vital to identify whether or not Dondozo is a good Pokemon to bring into the match with the team you are facing up against. If the opponent has enough ways to threaten Dondozo and severly hinder its progress or if Dondozo struggled to get value in a previous game, leaving Dondozo behind should be considered. Dondozo is also often checked by Rillaboom, using Fake Out to pivot around it and threatening super effective damage with Wood Hammer. It is important to force damage onto Rillaboom to allow Dondozo to pick up the KO on it or soften it up with Dondozo to allow a teammate to pick it up. The core of Incineroar and Amoonguss is also really strong against Dondozo, so it is important to limit switching and pressure Incineroar as much as possible. Softening up Incineroar and Amoonguss with early-game pressure from the likes of Indeedee-M, Annihilape, and any other offensive partners you might have is important, and putting yourself in a favorable position against a weakened Amoonguss to KO it or its partner Incineroar is very important as well. On the other hand, bulky Dondozo is often checked by Rillaboom; however, many of Dondozo's Grass-resistant partners appreciate the ability to take advantage of Rillaboom to either set up in Volcarona and Kingambit's case or hit it super effectively in Sneasler's case. Another one of Dondozo's checks is Amoonguss, which can take advantage of Dondozo's passivity and incapacitate it with Spore, and it often doesn't mind Yawn because with Regenerator, it often likes switching out anyway. Dondozo can take advantage of it by using its partner Electabuzz or Magmar to exploit Amoonguss, using their Spore immunity to play around it and allow their sweeper to set up with smart positioning. Electabuzz can also disable Amoonguss with Taunt, which Dondozo appreciates, while Magmar can threaten Amoonguss with super effective damage, which weakens it enough to be taken advantage of late-game.</li> </ul>",

This is because its ability prevents Farigiraf from being taunted by the main Taunt user in the format, Tornadus, and the opponent can no longer use Fake Out to stall out Trick Room turns. Additionally, Armor Tail gives Farigiraf a great matchup against Pokemon that rely on priority like Rillaboom and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p>The different Ogerpon formes are all great partners for Farigiraf, because the redirection means Trick Room is almost guaranteed to go up, while their Grass typing means that Spore is no longer an issue. Ogerpon-W has a great defensive typing and can easily tank most hits it redirects away from Farigiraf, Ogerpon-H hits Amoonguss and the Steel-types that resist Farigiraf's moves, and Ogerpon-C is particularly helpful for redirection due to its Sturdy ability. Rillaboom and Incineroar are also great partners, as Fake Out + Trick Room is a great combination due to the fact that Fake Out prevents both opponents from attacking Farigiraf before Trick Room goes up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Partners that are physically frail or weak to one of the big priority moves like Urshifu-R really enjoy having it as an ally. Flutter Mane is an excellent partner, as it can handily deal with the Dark-types that Farigiraf struggles against, and Ursaluna-B is a strong Trick Room sweeper that enjoys being immune to the Fake Out cycling from Incineroar and Rillaboom.</p> </li> <li> <p>Farigiraf can have a difficult time against Pokemon that can threaten to OHKO it both in and out of Terastallization, like Kingambit and Urshifu-S. Another issue is opposing Trick Room Pokemon, especially Torkoal and Amoonguss, the former being able to outspeed Farigiraf inside of Trick Room and OHKO it with Tera Fire-sun-boosted Eruptions, and the latter being able to put any Farigiraf that isn't running Safety Goggles to sleep and just being a general threat when Trick Room is up.</p> </li> </ul>",

Protect is just a generally consistent option, allowing Farigiraf to stick around to provide the team with priority blocking for longer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sitrus Berry is generally preferred, as the extra recovery allows it to live important attack combos such as Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash into Entei's Sacred Fire; however, Safety Goggles is also a valid option, allowing it to ignore Spore from opposing Amoonguss, a common counter to Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p>With Sitrus Berry recovery, Farigiraf can always survive an Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao and a Sword of Ruin-boosted Sacred Fire from Entei.

    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Coverage for Fighting-, Fairy- and Dark-types such as Primarina, Incineroar, and Sneasler is almost necessary when teambuilding with Kingambit. Both sets enjoy having redirection on their side, including the likes of Clefable, Electabuzz, and Amoonguss, which can easily take in Fighting-type attacks from threats like Annihilape and Sneasler. Swords Dance Kingambit can take advantage of redirection to a greater extent, since this can open windows for setup opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is a really good partner for Kingambit, providing setup opportunities with Fake Out and threatening Ground-types such as the Ursaluna formes. Dark-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar and even opposing Kingambit can be covered by Primarina, which also has great defensive synergy with Kingambit. Sneasler also works at removing Dark-types while also removing Fairy-types and providing another source of Fake Out support for Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit, thanks to its typing, is extremely weak to Fighting-types, including Annihilape, Sneasler, and Flamigo, which prove to be an issue. The aforementioned Amoonguss and Clefable can take in these Fighting-type attacks. Primarina, as mentioned before, has great defensive synergy with Kingambit, taking Fighting- and Fire-type attacks with ease, while Kingambit can cover for it against Grass- and Poison-type attacks.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Kingambit's main role is either a setup sweeper with Swords Dance or a defensive pivot piece with Asssault Vest. Swords Dance Kingambit's main goal is to set up and stay healthy; redirection and Fake Out support are usually necessary in achieving this. With Tera Dark and at +2, it's very easy for Kingambit to pick up momentum quickly and blitz through careless players. Don't be greedy with using Swords Dances, as it's easy for Kingambit to be OHKOed or brought to low health with careful positioning around Sucker Punch, especially in a format with Fighting-type coverage everywhere.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit succeeds as a setup sweeper thanks to its typing, bulk, and on Assault Vest sets, coverage. Its typing has many resistances to top types like Dragon, making Kingambit an amazing counter to Dragapult and Hydreigon. Kingambit's bulk, especially when it's paired with Assault Vest, is really good, allowing Kingambit to withstand hits and potentially turn the tables in a losing late-game position.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dark-resistant Pokemon are a huge issue for Kingambit, easily taking Kowtow Cleave and Sucker Punch even if they're boosted. These Pokemon can be taken care of by partners such as Primarina and Sneasler. Fighting-types, including the likes of Annihilape, can be a massive issue, easily using Kingambit to set up. Sneasler in particular can be a problem, only taking notable damage from Iron Head. Fighting-type coverage moves is also rather prevalent in the metagame, with Pokemon like Low Kick Tyranitar and Body Press Archaludon being common. For this, Ghost-type switch-ins like Dragapult or redirection can be helpful in deterring Fighting-type attacks. Additionally, opposing Sneasler can be picked off by Dragapult. Offensive Fairy-types such as Primarina can scare Kingambit away from Terastallizing into a Dark-type, as Moonblast would otherwise easily chunk Kingambit. Sneasler can easily deal with Fairy-types by hitting them hard with Dire Claw.</p> </li> </ul>",

On top of that, Sucker Punch can cause mind games, with Kingambit potentially just using Kowtow Cleave while forcing a switch with the threat of Sucker Punch. Low Kick can defeat Tyranitar and opposing Kingambit as well as Incineroar. Iron Head can be used as coverage for Dark-resistant Pokemon like Primarina and Sneasler, but it's generally harder to pilot and use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Black Glasses is used to boost the main two moves on Kingambit, Kowtow Cleave and Sucker Punch. It allows +2 Kowtow Cleave to OHKO Rillaboom outright and Archaludon with Tera Dark as well as letting Kingambit pick off Volcarona with a +2 Sucker Punch. Safety Goggles stops Sucker Punch from getting redirected and negated by Rage Powder, which can be a huge issue for Kingambit. Safety Goggles can also deny Spore, allowing Kingambit to use Amoonguss to set up. Safety Goggles can miss key OHKOs on the Pokemon shown in the aforementioned calculations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Dark boosts Kingambit's damage further, allowing for OHKOs on Maushold and Gholdengo with Sucker Punch, as well as removing Kingambit's Fire weakness and 4x Fighting weakness, proving to be useful against threats like Incineroar, which Kingambit otherwise struggles to get rid of, and certain Fighting-type coverage and Pokemon like opposing Kingambit's Low Kick and Annihilape, which otherwise OHKO Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit is really difficult to stop after a Swords Dance boost and Terastallizing, OHKOing Ursaluna with Kowtow Cleave.

It prefers partners with Fake Out like Incineroar, Sneasler, and Rillaboom as well as redirection from Pokemon like Amoonguss and Electabuzz in order to let it set up, while Choice Specs Gholdengo pairs best with priority Tailwind setters like Talonflame, Whimsicott, and Murkrow. Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Dragapult also synergize well with Gholdengo, as they can switch into Fire-type attacks like Volcarona's Heat Wave and Incineroar's Flare Blitz, while Gholdengo switches well into the Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks that threaten the aforementioned Dragon-types ands hit Fairy- and Ice-types for super effective damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nasty Plot Gholdengo synergizes well with Pokemon like Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Amoonguss that can give it turns to set up through Fake Out and Rage Powder. Choice Specs sets prefer partners with speed control options like Tailwind Whimsicott to help them against faster threats like Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gholdengo struggles against Pokemon that resist its STAB combination like Incineroar and Kingambit. Fighting- and Ground-types like Flamigo, Sneasler, Garchomp, and Ursaluna can help against bulky Dark- and Steel-types that resist Make It Rain and Shadow Ball. Garchomp is another threat, as it outspeeds Gholdengo and threatens it before and after Terastalizing with Stomping Tantrum and Dragon Claw, respectively.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Gholdengo's main role is to play as a sweeper. Depending on the set, it can accomplish this either by setting up with Nasty Plot or by removing opposing Steel-resistant Pokemon and then sweeping with Choice Specs-boosted Make It Rain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gholdengo is best used as an early- or late-game threat depending on the opposing team. Gameplay should focus on either removing Pokemon that can resist Make It Rain or using Gholdengo to break a hole in the opposing team and then using another strong offensive threat like Ursaluna to clean up afterwards. Nasty Plot sets are mostly used as an early-game option to take advantage of passive leads. Choice Specs sets can be used at any point in the game due to not needing to set up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kingambit and Incineroar are Gholdengo's biggest checks, as they resist its STAB attacks and can threaten it with super effective damage. Pokemon like Sneasler, Flamigo, and Paldean Tauros-W can threaten the aforementioned checks. Another method is to focus on chipping them down throughout the game before finishing them off with Gholdengo. Both Gholdengo sets struggle with smart switches, as Make It Rain lowers Special Attack, while Shadow Ball being single target leaves Gholdengo open to the other opposing Pokemon's attacks.</p> </li> </ul>",

  "Archaludon": {
    "comments": "<h3>Teambuilding</h3> <ul> <li>Assault Vest Archaludon is commonly used on rain-reliant teams, allowing it to use Electro Shot every turn. Rain teams also utilize powerful Water-types such as Basculegion-M, which threatens Ground-types like Ursaluna that threaten Archaludon. Assault Vest Archaludon also appreciates redirection and damage reduction, allowing it to set up freely while gaining boosts from Stamina. Power Herb Archaludon needs to deal as much damage as possible before fainting, so it is best paired with fast or priority-boosted forms of speed control like Whimsicott.</li> <li>When it's used with rain, common partners alongside Archaludon are Pelipper, Basculegion-M and Amoonguss. Pelipper and Basculegion-M cover Archaludon's Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses, while Amoonguss redirects damage with Rage Powder and can heal Archaludon with Pollen Puff. When using the Power Herb set, Archaludon is commonly paired with priority Tailwind users such as Whimsicott and Talonflame, allowing it to attack before its foes can, and it is used on balance teams paired with partners such as Rillaboom and Primarina that threaten Ground- and Fighting-types. Rillaboom can also disrupt opponents with Fake Out as well as healing Archaludon with Grassy Terrain. Incineroar also pairs well with both Archaludon sets, as it can disrupt opponents with Fake Out while providing damage reduction with Intimidate.</li> <li>Before Terastallizing, Archaludon takes severe damage from Ground- and Fighting-types such as Ursaluna and Flamigo. Water- and Grass-type partners such as Pelipper, Primarina, and Rillaboom mitigate the Ground-type weakness, with Pelipper and Primarina also threatening Fighting-types. Archaludon struggles to damage Ghost-types, in particular Gholdengo with its additional Steel typing, so Dark- and Ghost-type partners such as Incineroar and Basculegion-M can threaten them. Haze is another great roadblock to Archaludon. With Primarina being the most common Haze user, Rillaboom can threaten Primarina before it is able to use it.</li> </ul> <h3>Strategy Comments</h3> <ul> <li>Archaludon is a sweeper capable of dealing significant damage to most foes after a +1 Special Attack boost from Electro Shot or with Body Press after gaining multiple Defense boosts from Stamina. Archaludon should often be sent out first in order to start setting up early when using the Assault Vest set, and it functions best when it's used on rain teams.</li> <li>The Power Herb set can be used either early- or late-game. It mostly requires speed control through Tailwind in order to deal significant damage before fainting, making this set ideal on hyper offense teams. It can also be slotted onto balance teams that require a powerful special attacker or Steel- and Dragon-type coverage.</li> <li>Ursaluna is a huge check to Archaludon, as it's capable of OHKOing it before it Terastallizes, while Archaludon can't OHKO it back. Archaludon is therefore reliant on partners that can KO or weaken Ursaluna such as Basculegion-M and Incineroar. Gholdengo walls Archaludon, so it relies on partners like Incineroar to survive attacks from Gholdengo and threaten it back. Removing rain prevents Assault Vest Archaludon from freely gaining boosts and attacking with Electro Shot, greatly hindering its setup. This forces Pelipper to be brought back onto the field to reset the weather. Haze also counters Assault Vest Archaludon, severly weakening its damage output and bulk, so partners such as Rillaboom that can KO Haze users like Primarina before they can attack help to mitigate this.</li> </ul>",

Howl can be used to take advantage of passive playstyles and partially negate Intimidate, and with a Speed Booster Energy, it can support the Kingambit and Ogerpon-W in return.</p> </li> <li> <p>252 HP and 20 Defense EVs allow you to always live two Wicked Blows from Adamant Urshifu-S, and 164 Speed EVs with a Jolly Nature allow you to and outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Chien-Pao once the Booster Energy has been consumed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Grass is a good defensive Tera type for Gouging Fire, as it lets Gouging Fire resist Ground-type moves like Landorus's Earth Power and makes it immune to Spore, which is crucial since Burning Bulwark doesn't Protect Gouging Fire from status moves. Tera Fairy is also a good option as well, as it lets Gouging Fire resist both of Urshifu-S's STAB moves and take neutral damage from the majority of the metagame.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Raging Bolt": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Raging Bolt, with a higher Special Attack than Flutter Mane, massive HP, and good defenses, serves its role as a bulky damage dealer exceptionally well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't let Raging Bolt's middling Speed fool you; its signature move, Thunderclap, prevents it from being an issue in a lot of situations and makes the Tornadus + Urshifu-R matchup virtually trivial. Raging Bolt is also really strong into the Ogerpon formes and Rillaboom, as it resists all of their STAB moves except Ogerpon-C's, unless the Ogerpon-H and Rillaboom are carrying Stomping Tantrum and High Horsepower as coverage, respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raging Bolt pairs insanely well with Rillaboom and Incineroar, as they provide Fake Out pressure for Raging Bolt to take advantage of by lowering the foe's Special Attack or Speed on the Assault Vest set, set up with the Calm Mind set or deal massive damage with the three attacks set. Rillaboom also provides more longevity in Grassy Terrain for Raging Bolt, which can make it immensely difficult to KO. Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R are also excellent partners thanks to dealing with Raging Bolt's worst matchup, Landorus.</p> </li> <li> <p>That said, Raging Bolt does still have bad matchups, one of which is the aforementioned Landorus due to it being able to threaten an OHKO against Raging Bolt with Earth Power. Chien-Pao can also be a tricky matchup, as it can deal massive damage with its Ice-type STAB move and cause mindgames with Sucker Punch. Flutter Mane is able to deal huge damage to Raging Bolt even when it Terastallizes and can very comfortably take unboosted Thunderclaps.</p> </li> </ul>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Electroweb is sometimes run over Thunderbolt for speed control. Volt Switch allows for Raging Bolt to become a bulky pivot and pairs well with Draco Meteor, allowing it to switch out after the Special Attack drop. Snarl weakens opposing special attackers, enabling it to sit on the field for longer and deal damage. Tera Blast gives Raging Bolt a strong option into bulky Dark-types and Fighting-types like Ting-Lu and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assault Vest allows Raging Bolt to fully take advantage of its amazing bulk, letting it sit on the field and tank hit after hit all while dealing respectable damage and disrupting the foe with moves like Snarl and Electroweb.</p> </li> <li> <p>The defensive investment allows Raging Bolt to always survive Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao and Moonblast from Choice Specs Flutter Mane. The Speed investment allows Raging Bolt to outspeed Glimmora and Modest Chi-Yu after an Electroweb. The rest of the EVs were put into offensive investment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Fairy is just an incredibly strong neutral Tera type, especially for a Pokemon with as much bulk as Raging Bolt has, and provides a resistance to Urshifu-S's STAB moves.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thunderclap is a good main STAB move, as it allows Raging Bolt to focus less on Speed and go all out on bulk investment, as it will be able to boost up then hit most foes before they can retaliate.</p> </li> <li> <p>While Dragon Pulse is usually an underwhelming move, it serves as a strong neutral STAB move into Pokemon that resist Electric-type attacks when paired with Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>In some situations, Thunderbolt can be used over Protect, due to Raging Bolt being bulky enough to where Protect isn't mandatory on Calm Mind sets, and for consistency against support PokÃ©mon such as Follow Me Ogerpon-W where Thunderclap would fail.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leftovers is preferred on the Calm Mind set, providing immense longevity with Grassy Terrain from Rillaboom.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Defense EVs with the HP EVs allow Raging Bolt to live Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao. The HP EVs make the HP optimized for Leftovers and Grassy Terrain recovery. The bulk investment ensures that Raging Bolt is able to tank 2 unboosted Moonblasts from Timid Flutter Mane at +1 Special Defense after Leftovers and Grassy Terrain recovery combined with Protect. The Special Defense EVs hit an even number to be optimal for the Calm Mind boost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raging Bolt utilizes Tera Fairy for the resistance to Urshifu-S's STAB moves and neutral matchup against the majority of the metagame.</p> </li> </ul>"

Draco Meteor is a more powerful option, being able to OHKO PokÃ©mon like Landorus when used with Booster Energy. However, it can be forced to switch out after a Special Attack drop and lose the boost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Booster Energy is a strong option, as boosting Raging Bolt's already huge base Special Attack even further turns it into an absolute nuke. Safety Goggles prevents Amoonguss from redirecting Thunderclaps away from Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Speed investment allows Raging Bolt to outspeed Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao while under Tailwind, allowing it to hit them with its stronger options like Thunderbolt and Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tera Grass is a good option to not only resist Ground-type moves from Landorus but also ignore Amoonguss's Spore and redirection with Rage Powder without running Safety Goggles. Tera Electric will often be a consistent option for just raw damage output.</p> </li> </ul>"

  "Iron Crown": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Crown is an excellent choice for offensive teams looking to take advantage of the powerful move Expanding Force thanks to its well-rounded stats and access to Booster Energy. It performs best against frailer offensive teams consisting of Pokemon that do not resist Expanding Force, such as Tornadus, Landorus, and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it can be used as a sweeper early-game to soften opposing teams, it is usually better to save Iron Crown for the late-game when its checks have been sufficiently weakened for it to sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indeedee-F is by far Iron Crown's best teammate, offering role compression as a Psychic Terrain setter and redirector. Access to Helping Hand also further amplifies its partner's ridiculous damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Crown's best counters are Dark- and Steel-types, namely Incineroar, Kingambit, Archaludon, and Gholdengo, all of which resist both of Iron Crown's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore, Iron Crown appreciates Pokemon that can help remove these threats consistently, such as Landorus, Entei, and Urshifu-R. In return, Iron Crown can pressure opposing Urshifu-R and Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is another noteworthy check, as it is able to safely pivot in and override Psychic Terrain, weakening Expanding Force significantly. Other Pokemon with access to Ice Spinner like Chien-Pao and Dragonite can also be used to remove Psychic Terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane serve as good checks as well, but they have to watch out for Follow Me from Indeedee-F as they are vulnerable to Tachyon Cutter.</p> </li> </ul>",
