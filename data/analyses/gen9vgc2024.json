Snarl helps tremendously against special attackers like Terapagos, Calyrex-S, and Lunala, dealing a decent chunk of damage to the latter two. Helping Hand can also be used in this slot to further boost the team's offensive pressure to help secure KOs, such as Helping Hand-boosted Tera Fairy Zacian-C OHKOing Incineroar with Play Rough.

Safety Goggles gives it a much needed immunity to Amoonguss, which can otherwise completely shut down Umbreon with Spore and Rage Powder.

Fake Out is the best last move on Smeargle, providing lots of pressure when it enters the field and opening up room for repositioning or setting up. Smeargle can use Spiky Shield over Fake Out for added longevity and to keep Focus Sash intact against opposing Fake Out. Transform can be used to utilize Smeargle as an offensive threat and win condition, especially when transforming into partner Calyrex-S or opposing Restricted Pokemon. Smeargle requires Focus Sash to make up for its horrendous bulk.

Snarl weakens special attackers like Calyrex-S, Terapagos, and Kyogre. Tailwind provides speed control for the team, while Mist finds a niche in protecting the team from stat drops, such as from Intimidate and Snarl. Roar allows Suicune to prevent Trick Room from going up by forcefully switching out setters like Farigiraf and Calyrex-I and can neutralize setup attempts from Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos while tanking attacks like Glacial Lance and Tera Starstorm thanks to its excellent defenses. Meanwhile, Helping Hand boosts the partner Pokemon's damage output to quickly KO opposing Pokemon. Icy Wind is a nice alternative in this slot for a lingering Speed reduction, which can come in handy when facing Calyrex-S and Zacian-C. Safety Goggles grants an immunity to Spore and Rage Powder and is especially useful to force out Trick Room setters with Roar while ignoring Amoonguss. Leftovers, on the other hand, provides passive recovery to further increase Suicune's longevity when combined with its natural bulk. The EV spread allows Suicune to avoid a 3HKO from -1 Choice Specs Terapagos's and Calyrex I's Tera Starstorm and High Horsepower, respectively, and turns Koraidon's Collision Course into a 3HKO after Leftovers recovery. The Special Defense EVs let Suicune survive two Astral Barrages from +1 bulky Calyrex-S. The Speed investment enables Suicune to outspeed most Rillaboom, helping it set up Tailwind before Rillaboom can hit it with a Wood Hammer. Tera Dark provides a resistance to Ghost-type attacks like Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, an immunity to its Psyshock, and an immunity to Prankster Taunt from Tornadus and Whimsicott, and it also enables Suicune to 2HKO Calyrex-S with Snarl.</p> <p>Due to its passive field presence, Suicune is immediately threatened by strong super effective attacks like Volt Switch and Electro Drift from Miraidon, Thunderbolt from Raging Bolt, and Wood Hammer from Rillaboom. Pokemon carrying Covert Cloak, like Calyrex-S and Terapagos, can simply choose to ignore Suicune and set up. Prankster Taunt users like Tornadus can shut down most of Suicune's support options as well, unless it Terastallizes. This makes fast offensive Pokemon like Zacian-C excellent partners for Suicune, as they outspeed and threaten to OHKO most of the aforementioned Pokemon while appreciating the protection against stat drops provided by Suicune's Mist. Landorus counters threatening Electric-types like Miraidon and Raging Bolt and deals massive damage to Rillaboom with Sludge Bomb. Incineroar provides Fake Out and Intimidate support, gets rid of Covert Cloak with Knock Off, and threatens to burn Rillaboom with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

Wide Guard is an excellent utility move, which not only protects its partner but, along with Pelipper's typing, also allows it to counter many Restricted Pokemon such as Groudon, Koraidon, both Calyrex formes, and Kyogre. Weather Ball and Hurricane's high Base Power make up for Pelipper's middling Special Attack, nuking most targets weak to its STAB moves, such as both Urshifu formes and Incineroar. Protect is generally preferred for utility and to block Fake Out, but Helping Hand can be used to support its teammates, thanks to moving before Fake Out. Focus Sash is needed to guarantee Pelipper can remain a threat even when facing one of the many Pokemon that can hit it for super effective damage. Tera Ghost is a generally strong Tera type and allows Pelipper to dodge Fake Out, which is especially important because it threatens to break Focus Sash. Tera Stellar is also viable to boost Pelipper's damage.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that benefits from rain or Wide Guard appreciates Pelipper's support. Calyrex-I, Zacian-C, and Urshifu-R all value Pelipper's support, with Wide Guard blocking super effective Astral Barrages and Precipice Blades and rain boosting Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. Other support Pokemon like Amoonguss and Incineroar are also strong with Pelipper defensively, with it handling threats such as Urshifu-R and Landorus for Incineroar and Wide Guard blocking Bleakwind Storms from hitting Amoonguss. Its low Speed tier means it's essentially useless against Pokemon that can exploit its Speed and bring it down to its Focus Sash, leaving Pelipper unable to do anything without the threat of being knocked out. Opposing weather also completely cripples Pelipper, as its moves rely on rain to be consistent; however, its lower Speed compared to most weather setters means this scenario is playable, with rain more commonly lasting its five turns.

This can be patched up by using Urshifu-R, which outspeeds most of the metagame with a Choice Scarf and threatens high damage. Amoonguss is quite annoying for Kyogre as well, threatening Spore while taking resisted damage. However, Tornadus, a great partner to Kyogre, can shut it down with Taunt while also providing Prankster Tailwind and Rain Dance, which can be used to reset weather against Groudon and Terapagos-S. Archaludon has great defensive synergy with Kyogre, switching into Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, as well as taking the opportunity to start setting up with Electro Shot.</p>"

Groudon uses Swords Dance to set up and be able to OHKO foes such as Zamazenta-C and Calyrex-I. Groudon can also utilize Thunder Punch to hit rain setters like Tornadus, Pelipper, and Kyogre. Helping Hand allows lets Groudon to further boost its teammate's damage output. Groudon's ability to set sun benefits Pokemon such as Flutter Mane or and Raging Bolt. Groudon uses Clear Amulet mainly to block Incineroar's Intimidate and Parting Shot. The Speed investment allows Groudon to outspeed -1 Ogerpon and Calyrex-S in Tailwind. The Defense EVs let Groudon live two Urshifu-R Mystic Water-boosted Surging Strikes in sun, as well as surviving a Wood Hammer from Rillaboom and the Ogerpon formes and +1 Zamazenta-C Body Press. The Attack investment allows Heat Crash to OHKO Amoonguss, Flutter Mane, and Tornadus with sun up, as well as almost always OHKO Miraidon with Precipice Blades. Groudon will also be able to OHKO Urshifu-R with +2 Precipice Blades. The Special Defense EVs let Groudon survive a Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane Moonblast and a +1 Spell Tag Calyrex-S Astral Barrage.</p> <p>Some counters to Groudon include Kyogre and Terapagos, which can remove Groudon's weather. Lunala is another bad matchup for Groudon, as it can easily take a boosted Precipice Blades while moving before it in Trick Room. Groudon has to be very careful around Calyrex-I, since it threatens to OHKO Groudon if it doesn't Terastallize. Some good non-Restricted Pokemon counters such as Pelipper and Landorus can work because of their immunity to Precipice Blades. Pelipper can additionally remove the sun from Groudon, significantly weakening its Heat Crash. Some good teammates for Groudon are Flutter Mane, Raging Bolt, and Walking Wake because the Protosynthesis ability allows them to get faster or stronger, and Groudon setting sun allows for these abilities to be activated. Raging Bolt helps Groudon deal with Kyogre and Pelipper, while Flutter Mane deals with the Ogerpon formes. Other good teammates for Groudon are Incineroar, which provides Fake Out and Intimidate, Amoonguss, which provides Spore and Rage Powder support, and Rillaboom, which is another Fake Out user that provides Grassy Terrain recovery so Groudon can stay on the field longer and set up with Swords Dance. Amoonguss also helps in the Trick Room matchup against Calyrex-I.</p>"

Moonblast provides a reliable STAB move that lets Whimsicott deal solid damage to common Fairy-weak Pokemon like Miraidon, Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and the Urshifu formes. Encore is Whimsicott's most infamous support option, letting it punish setup sweepers like Calm Mind Terapagos, IronPress Zamazenta-C, and Nasty Plot Calyrex-S for attempting to boost in front of it; the move also punishes foes from trying to stall out Tailwind turns with Protect, and it discourages Rillaboom from using Fake Out lest it be locked into it. Additionally, it forces Trick Room setters like Calyrex-I to untwist the dimensions. Taunt is a similarly useful disruption tool that can be used with or in place of Encore, notably allowing Whimsicott to deny Tailwind from other setters like Tornadus and Lunala unless they use Tera Dark. Protect helps Whimsicott keep itself on the field and stay in a position to use its other moves repeatedly, especially in the face of Fake Out users, but the last moveslot can also be spent on more aggressive options like Helping Hand, which is useful with any attacker, or Fake Tears, which is especially devastating alongside strong special threats like Chi-Yu. Whimsicott enjoys holding a Focus Sash to make up for its poor bulk, and Tera Ghost is useful to prevent the item from being wasted by Fake Out.</p> <p>Whimsicott's reliable Tailwind support is a blessing to almost every Restricted Pokemon, especially those with middling Speed tiers such as Groudon, Calyrex-S, and Terapagos. All three of those Pokemon also benefit from Encore, which can create space for them to set up with Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, and Calm Mind, respectively. Clear Amulet Koraidon is another notable partner that reliably discourages opponents from bringing Incineroar, which is easily the worst Pokemon for Whimsicott to face in a battle. Other strong attackers that benefit from Tailwind support are also great with it; Landorus and Urshifu-S both fall into this category, and Chi-Yu is a standout example because it augments Whimsicott's modest damage output with Beads of Ruin. Other setup Pokemon that enjoy Encore are especially useful to justify using Whimsicott on a team over Tornadus, including Calm Mind Raging Bolt, Swords Dance Ogerpon-H, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo. It's important to make sure Whimsicott has teammates that can deal with problematic Dark-types like Chi-Yu, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit due to their Prankster immunity, and a Fighting-type like Urshifu-R or Iron Hands can help with that significantly.</p>"

      "Prankster Support": {
        "description": "<p>Whimsicott is a potent Tailwind setter in the Regulation G metagame thanks to Prankster in conjunction with its good supporting movepool, and its typing lets it take on staples such as Raging Bolt and both Urshifu formes. Moonblast lets Whimsicott consistently damage bulky Pokemon such as the aforementioned Raging Bolt while also chipping down Rillaboom and Incineroar. It also lets Whimsicott take full advantage of its good matchup against both Urshifu formes, threatening Urshifu-R with a 2HKO and Urshifu-S with an OHKO once its Focus Sash is broken. Whimsicott's ability to punish passive play like Protect via Encore allows fast-paced teammates like Choice Specs Miraidon and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu to safely output huge damage. Encore also has other immensely useful applications like forcing non-Dark-type Fake Out users like Rillaboom and Iron Hands to switch out if they choose to use the move and reversing Trick Room in the face of threats such as Calyrex-I; this is crucial, as Tailwind teams inherently struggle against Trick Room, especially when they have multiple Pokemon weak to the aforementioned Calyrex-I. Light Screen helps bolster Whimsicott and its allies' bulk against threats such as Calyrex-S and Choice Specs Terapagos. Covert Cloak lets Whimsicott safely ignore Fake Out and set up Tailwind, allowing it to threaten with Encore on the following turn. The physical bulk investment allows Whimsicott to avoid an OHKO from -1 Zamazenta-C's Heavy Slam while never being 2HKOed by +1 Body Press. The special bulk investment enables Whimsicott to never be OHKOed by Choice Specs Tera Stellar Terapagos-S's Tera Starstorm and Mystic Water Kyogre's Water Spout in rain even at full power. Maximum Speed is run in order to let Whimsicott have the best chance to force opposing Whimsicott to repeatedly use Tailwind with Encore, which is an interaction that can also be put to use against the slower Tornadus. Tera Fire rids Whimsicott of its weakness to Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Incineroar's Flare Blitz among other powerful moves like Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance and Koraidon's sun-boosted Flare Blitz, crucially never getting 2HKOed by Glacial Lance. Alternatively, Tera Water lets it retain its initial resistance to Kyogre's Water Spout and Origin Pulse in addition to the resistances provided by Tera Fire in exchange for sacrificing the positive defensive matchup against Rillaboom and Raging Bolt. Tera Water also provides Whimsicott with a better matchup against Calyrex-I and Pelipper.</p> <p>Whimsicott, being rather frail, is vulnerable to many relevant Pokemon, most notably Tornadus, as not only does it compete with Whimsicott as a Prankster Tailwind user on nearly every team apart from Miraidon hyper offense, but it also threatens an OHKO with Bleakwind Storm because Whimsicott lacks a Focus Sash. Thus, Miraidon makes for a good partner, as it can easily OHKO Tornadus. Whimsicott supports Choice Specs Miraidon exceptionally well, letting it dish out massive amounts of damage with Tera Electric uncontested under Tailwind. Encore punishes opposing Fake Out users, allowing Choice Specs Miraidon to stay on the field more safely. Whimsicott also helps Chi-Yu do great amounts of damage onto foes thanks to Tailwind and checks Raging Bolt for both it and Miraidon thanks to Beads of Ruin; this is of great value, as Miraidon is otherwise forced to lock into Draco Meteor. Whimsicott is susceptible to being removed by faster Pokemon like Calyrex-I under Trick Room and Chien-Pao, so you should be wise with managing its health and speed control. Iron Hands allows this to happen quite well, not only taking advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed but also heavily threatening Chien-Pao. Its good bulk, access to Fake Out, and healing from Drain Punch allow it to keep Whimsicott safe for multiple turns.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Quiver Dance Volcarona is a very interesting Pokemon in Regulation G because of its amazing setup potential, good bulk, and respectable damage after Quiver Dance. Volcarona does well against Zamazenta-C and Calyrex-I, since it can 2HKO both of them with Flamethrower. The Special Defense investment allows Volcarona to almost always survive a Life Orb Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B and three non-Terastallized Choice Specs Moonblasts from Flutter Mane. The Speed investment allows it to outspeed Pokemon with base 135 Speed after a Quiver Dance, and a Timid nature lets Volcarona outspeed Calyrex-S after one Quiver Dance as well. 92 Defense EVs allow it to survive 2 Icicle Crashes from Chien-Pao and two Behemoth Blades from Zacian-C after Leftovers recovery. Flame Body is a great ability, as being able to burn an opposing Pokemon is very valuable in case you are facing down Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta-C. Volcarona loves to run Tera Dragon to give it helpful resistances to Water- and Electric-type moves such as Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Electro Drift from Miraidon.</p> <p>Volcarona can, however, have some tough matchups. Kyogre specifically is a horrible matchup for it, as Water Spout is a guaranteed OHKO against a Volcarona that is not Terastallized. Both Kyogre and Pelipper can dampen Volcarona's damage output as well, forcing it to rely on Bug Buzz, which does not threaten Kyogre or Pelipper in the slightest. Koraidon and the Ogerpon formes can all do massive damage to it as well. The aforementioned Urshifu-R is also a check to Volcarona, since it can OHKO Volcarona that is not Terastallized with Surging Strikes. Pelipper and Tornadus are also threats since they can hit Volcarona for super effective damage with their STAB moves. A lot of these bad matchups are why it is so important to run Miraidon next to Volcarona, as Miraidon can OHKO the aforementioned checks. Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Iron Hands can all help with setting up Quiver Dance with Fake Out, and Whimsicott can help set up Quiver Dance with Encore or provide speed control with Tailwind in case Quiver Dance isn’t the best option in the current game state.</p>"

      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<p>Volcarona can be used as an effective support Pokemon that is capable of redirecting attacks for its partners and weakening opponents. Volcarona matches up well into powerful special attackers such as Terapagos, Raging Bolt, and Ursaluna-B, as it can lower their Special Attack with Struggle Bug. Volcarona also has great matchups into physical threats such as Calyrex-I, Zacian-C, and Zamazenta-C, as it is capable of surviving their attacks and crippling them with a burn with Flame Body or Will-O-Wisp. Overheat is used to deal significant damage to Calyrex-I and Zacian-C, while Flamethrower is used for more consistent damage. Bug Buzz can be a great alternative when Volcarona is paired with Kyogre to deal consistent, unhindered damage to Grass-types threatening Kyogre such as Rillaboom, as well as allowing it to damage Incineroar, Farigiraf, and Raging Bolt sufficiently. Safety Goggles provides Volcarona with immunity to opposing Rage Powder and Spore, while Covert Cloak is used to gain immunity from Fake Out flinching, allowing it to continue supporting its teammates unhindered. Rocky Helmet synergizes with Volcarona's redirection by dealing chip damage, allowing it to break Focus Sash or KO Pokemon brought down to 1 HP with Focus Sash. This is especially effective against Urshifu-R after Volcarona Terastallizes, with Rocky Helmet and Flame Body working in tandem to deal significant damage and burn Urshifu-R, punishing Surging Strikes. The defensive investment allows Volcarona to frequently survive Flare Blitz from Koraidon and makes High Horsepower from Calyrex-I and Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C only 3HKO, while the Speed investment allows Volcarona to outrun Smeargle. Tera Water offers resistance to Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Water Spout from Kyogre as well as a resistance to Flare Blitz from Koraidon, while Tera Grass provides an immunity to Spore and Rage Powder while also resisting the aforementioned Water-type attacks.</p> <p>Volcarona pairs well with Terapagos, as Volcarona can burn the Fighting-types that threaten Terapagos such as Urshifu-R, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta-C and redirect attacks, allowing Terapagos to set up with Calm Mind. Volcarona struggles against Water-types like Urshifu-R and Kyogre as well as Flying-types like Tornadus and Pelipper, as it cannot damage them sufficiently and is threatened by their STAB attacks. As a result, Rillaboom is a great partner, as it can threaten these Water-types as well as provide Grassy Terrain recovery, boosting Volcarona's longevity. Volcarona also struggles against Fire-types and Pokemon that usually utilize Tera Fire such as Incineroar and Koraidon, as it can neither burn nor deal significant damage to them. Urshifu-R and Kyogre therefore pair well with Volcarona, both of which threaten Incineroar and Koraidon with their STAB Water-type attacks; Kyogre also overrides Koraidon's sun with its own rain, further hindering Koraidon. In return, Volcarona threatens checks to the aforementioned Water-types such as Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, as it can burn Rillaboom with Will-O-Wisp or through Flame Body and redirect Raging Bolt's Electric STABs with Rage Powder.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Tailwind Support": {
        "description": "<p>Tornadus is used as a support Pokemon that can set Tailwind for its team and deal semi-consistent damage with Bleakwind Storm. It is very good into Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom, as Tornadus can easily use Taunt or threaten them with Bleakwind Storm. Tornadus can make use of its weather-setting abilities to help itself hit Bleakwind Storms or to help support its teammates by boosting or reducing the damage of Water- or Fire-type moves. Icy Wind provides a secondary form of speed control for Tornadus and helps against other Tailwind-based teams. Protect can also help against Fake Out if it holds Rocky Helmet Covert Cloak allows Tornadus to shine as a supportive piece, as it stops it from being flinched by the common Fake Out. It also prevents it from having its Special Attack lowered by Snarl. Rocky Helmet acts more as a repellent for attacks like Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Chien-Pao's Ice Spinner. It also can make Pokemon more wary of using Fake Out, as they will be constantly taking chip damage. The EV spread on this Tornadus allows it to take a Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R. This can be really impactful on the Rocky Helmet set, as it forces Urshifu-R down to 50% of its health upon hitting it. It can also take an Astral Barrage from Choice Specs Calyrex-S. Tera Dark is mainly used to stop other Tornadus from using Taunt or Whimsicott from using Encore on it. It can also be used as a defensive Tera against Calyrex-S, as it resists or is immune to both of its STAB attacks. Tera Steel can be used to resist attacks from Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and the occasional Rock-type. It also removes a weakness to Electric, which can make it fare better against Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Tornadus is a good partner for many Pokemon thanks to its ability to support them through speed control and weather. One example of this is Chi-Yu, which makes use of Tornadus's ability to set sun and Tailwind to blast through opposing teams. Chi-Yu also helps Tornadus's Bleakwind Storms do more damage. Kyogre is another good partner, as Tornadus allows it to outspeed non-Tailwind teams with its below average Speed stat. Tornadus can also help to stop other weather teams from outdamaging Kyogre while letting Kyogre deal with opposing weather attackers. Tornadus benefits other Pokemon with its weather as well such as Urshifu-R, Koraidon and Archaludon. It can also provide a check to weather-setting Pokemon like Koraidon and Groudon with opposing weather. Checks to Tornadus include Miraidon and Raging Bolt. Their ability to resist its attacks and fire back with powerful Electric-type STAB moves can threaten both Tornadus and its common partners. One other check is Kingambit. Often, Tornadus cannot attack with Bleakwind Storm due to the threat of Defiant being activated. It can easily set up in front of Tornadus or, if it has Assault Vest, threaten its partner. Landorus, however, can help to beat some of these checks with strong Sandsear Storms in Rain while being immune to Miraidon's and Raging Bolt's Electric-type STAB moves. Trick Room teams are also a bad matchup, as they flip the Speed stats and make Tailwind useless. Calyrex-I is especially tough for Tornadus, as it can target it down with strong Glacial Lances or set Trick Room right in front of it.</p>"

Its access to Fake Out and Parting Shot combined with its great natural bulk make for a strong combination, demanding respect from foes lest they be forced to switch out, leaving themselves vulnerable to Incineroar's allies, or stay on the field outputting negligible damage. Incineroar is naturally blessed with a typing that lets it take on both Restricted Pokemon, such as Lunala and Calyrex-S, and strong non-Restricteds like Chien-Pao, Rillaboom, and Chi-Yu. Will-O-Wisp ruins IronPress Zamazenta-C and Clear Amulet Calyrex-I; this is of great value, as they normally are not hindered by Intimidate since the former relies on its Defense stat to deal damage and the latter almost always runs Clear Amulet. Alternatively, Flare Blitz provides high damage output against Rillaboom and Amoonguss and OHKOes Chien-Pao. Taunt can also be utilized on specific teams, such as those with Calyrex-I, to shut down Amoonguss. Knock Off is crucial to OHKO Calyrex-S while removing items such as Safety Goggles from opposing Incineroar to aid its own partner Amoonguss. Holding Safety Goggles itself allows Incineroar to have a better matchup against Amoonguss, letting it ignore Spore and Rage Powder, but Sitrus Berry can viably be run to provide crucial longevity to Incineroar in this powerful Restricted metagame. The given EV spread allows Incineroar to always survive a Jolly Close Combat from Mienshao. As an added bonus, it also takes a +1 Defense Body Press from Zamazenta-C, allowing it to use Will-O-Wisp or get better positioning against Zamazenta-C's allies. The special bulk EVs allow Incineroar to avoid a 2HKO from +1 Life Orb Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, letting it retaliate with Knock Off. 27 Speed IVs are run in order to get a slower Parting Shot than opposing Incineroar, allowing the user's Incineroar's Parting Shot to go off onto a freshly switched-in opposing Pokemon for greater value. Tera Ghost allows Incineroar to ignore Fake Out from opposing Incineroar or Rillaboom, Close Combat from Mienshao and either Urshifu forme, and Body Press from Zamazenta-C. Tera Grass lets Incineroar resist Water Spout from Kyogre while being immune to Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, essentially functioning as a built-in Safety Goggles. Alternatively, Tera Water can be used to keep the resistance to Water Spout and resist Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance in exchange for a neutral matchup against opposing Incineroar and being unable to ignore Amoonguss.</p> <p>Incineroar pairs well with virtually every Restricted Pokemon, providing Fake Out support in conjunction with solid bulk and damage reduction. As useful as Incineroar is, it is severely threatened by Pokemon such as Koraidon and Kyogre, the former of which is immune to Intimidate thanks to Clear Amulet and can easily OHKO Incineroar with Collision Course. The latter is Incineroar's worst matchup, as it easily gets OHKOed by Water Spout and even Origin Pulse if rain is on the field. Miraidon is also a huge nuisance when used with Choice Specs, as it can either potentially OHKO Incineroar with Electro Drift or pivot around it with Volt Switch, chipping it or its allies down. The susceptibility to Koraidon can be mitigated by having Flutter Mane or Fairy Tera Raging Bolt as a partner, as both take advantage of Koraidon's sun via Protosynthesis and force it to Terastallize. Incineroar should also be carefully preserved against Calyrex-I because it commonly runs Clear Amulet and High Horsepower, which can 2HKO Incineroar. Incineroar also struggles against a top non-Restricted Pokemon in Urshifu-R, so allies such as Rillaboom and/or Amoonguss are appreciated to keep it and other threats like Kyogre and Miraidon in check.</p>"

Lunala uses Moonblast to hit Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S that resist Moongeist Beam. Calm Mind gives Lunala more bulk to survive against special attackers like Calyrex-S and Miraidon and boosts its damage output, making it a threat. Leftovers provides recovery for Lunala to help it regain Shadow Shield. The defensive investment allows Lunala to live Dark Pulse from Chi-Yu, Shadow Ball from Choice Specs Flutter Mane, and Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S. The offensive investment allows Lunala to OHKO Calyrex-I after a Calm Mind, OHKO Gholdengo, and nearly OHKO bulky Flutter Mane, all with Moongeist Beam. The Speed EVs help outspeed bulky Gholdengo and paralyzed Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Lunala uses Tera Fairy to remove its weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks like Knock Off and Astral Barrage from Incineroar and Calyrex-S, respectively. Tera Fairy also boosts the damage from Moonblast, which helps threaten Dark-types.</p> <p>Dark- and Ghost-types such as Incineroar, Chi-Yu, and Calyrex-S threaten Lunala with their STAB moves like Knock Off, Snarl, and Astral Barrage, respectively. Amoonguss threatens Lunala with Spore while tanking its attacks. Miraidon threatens Lunala with immediate offensive pressure, preventing Lunala from setting up in front of it. Pelipper helps against Koraidon, Incineroar, and Chi-Yu with Drizzle, threatens to OHKO the latter two with Weather Ball, and helps against Amoonguss with Hurricane. Pelipper's access to Wide Guard protects Lunala from Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage and Chi-Yu's Snarl. Rillaboom is another great option for Lunala thanks to Grassy Terrain, which offers recovery and a way to override Miraidon's Electric Terrain, and Fake Out, allowing Lunala to set up with Calm Mind. Urshifu-R provides offensive pressure on a lot of Lunala's threats like Chi-Yu, Incineroar, Chien-Pao, Calyrex-S, Terapagos, and Ursaluna-B and synergizes well with Pelipper thanks to rain boosting Surging Strikes and Rillaboom because it handles Fire-types that threaten Rillaboom. Incineroar can use Taunt to shut down Amoonguss, has Intimidate to weaken physical threats such as Zacian-C and Chien-Pao, and has access to Fake Out, making it a great partner for Lunala to set up next to. Grimmsnarl helps Lunala survive against offensive threats such as Miraidon, Koraidon, and the Calyrex formes thanks to Prankster Light Screen and Reflect reducing the damage Lunala and its allies will be taking while providing speed control in Thunder Wave.</p>"

Meteor Beam gives Lunala a strong setup option while having the extra benefit of doing major damage to Incineroar and other Pokemon weak to Rock. Lunala's access to Wide Guard paired with its Ghost typing gives it a favorable matchup into popular restricted Pokemon like Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C by blocking their strong STAB moves in Body Press and Glacial Lance, respectively. Trick Room allows Lunala to set the pace of the match to its favor, with Moonblast being a solid alternative to cover for Dark-types when speed control isn't necessary. The EV spread allows Lunala to take Wicked Blow and Life Orb-boosted Astral Barrage from Urshifu-S and Calyrex-S with Shadow Shield active. Tera Fairy removes Lunala's Dark and Ghost weaknesses while being a strong defensive typing itself, giving Lunala the opportunity to safely stay in against would-be checks like Incineroar and Flutter Mane while having the extra benefit of boosting Moonblast.</p> <p>Lunala naturally struggles against Dark- and Normal-types like Incineroar and Terapagos, both taking negligible to no damage from Moongeist Beam once Power Herb is used up by Meteor Beam. Calyrex-S also forces Lunala to either use Wide Guard or Terastallize to avoid major damage. Urshifu-R is a phenomenal partner for Lunala, as it's able to cover Lunala's weaknesses and OHKO threatening Pokemon like Incineroar, Terapagos, and Calyrex-S; it is also protected by Lunala's Wide Guard from strong spread moves like Bleakwind Storm and Astral Barrage. Incineroar also forms a solid defensive backbone when paired with Urshifu-R as well as generating opportunities for Lunala to set up Trick Room with Fake Out. Amoonguss provides redirection support as well as Pollen Puff healing to keep Lunala at full HP for Shadow Shield; it also synergizes extremely well with Lunala's other common partners like Urshifu-R and Incineroar. Tailwind + Trick Room teams that run Lunala also benefit from strong Tailwind setters like Tornadus and Whimsicott, giving Lunala the flexibility to go for a fast game mode in specific matchups.</p>"

Grassy Glide is used, since it allows Rillaboom to threaten Pokemon that are faster than it like Urshifu-R. High Horsepower is used to threaten super effective damage on Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Miraidon, and Incineroar. U-turn allows Rillaboom to switch in and out of the battle, helping it reset Grassy Terrain consistently. Protect can be utilized on Miracle Seed variants to block Fake Out as well as stall Trick Room. Choice Band allows Rillaboom to OHKO foes it normally doesn't, while Miracle Seed allows Rillaboom to use Fake Out and means that Rillaboom isn't locked into a single move. The EV spread allows Rillaboom to OHKO Urshifu-R with Miracle Seed Grassy Glide and almost always OHKO Calyrex-I with Choice Band Tera Grass Wood Hammer. In conjunction with Choice Band, Rillaboom can OHKO Miraidon with High Horsepower. The defensive investment allows Rillaboom to survive a Flare Blitz from Incineroar. Tera Grass is used to amplify Rillaboom's damage, while Tera Fire is used defensively to resist Fire- and Ice-type moves like Flare Blitz from Incineroar and Ice Spinner from Chien-Pao. Tera Fire can also be used to gain immunity to Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Rillaboom is a great partner to Zamazenta-C, which appreciates its offensive capability to threaten Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre.

Rillaboom pairs well with Chien-Pao, which provides another multiplier to Rillaboom's nuclear damage through Sword of Ruin; in return, Rillaboom helps Chien-Pao by OHKOing Urshifu-R. Urshifu-R and Incineroar are great teammates as well, as the trio forms the Fire / Water / Grass core. Rillaboom has a bad matchup against Incineroar and Tornadus, which resist its moves and threaten it with Flare Blitz and Bleakwind Storm, respectively. Furthermore, Incineroar is a counter to Rillaboom thanks to Intimidate and its ability to threaten Fake Out on Choice Band variants.

Foul Play is also good insurance against both Calyrex-S and Calyrex-I, forcing them to Terastallize if they don't want to take a lot of damage. Thunder Wave provides speed control to allow Grimmsnarl's allies to outspeed foes after they've been paralyzed. Light Clay makes Reflect and Light Screen last longer, allowing it to utilize its other two moves more often. The EVs put into Defense allow Grimmsnarl to always survive a Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C through Reflect after an Intimidate and almost always survive Tera Water Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R. The EVs put into Special Defense give Grimmsnarl the bulk to survive Electro Drift from Choice Specs Miraidon through Light Screen. Tera Ghost is used to avoid Fake Out, which ruins Grimmsnarl's momentum.</p> <p>Fake Out is often used to prevent Grimmsnarl from setting Light Screen and Reflect up and can lead to being KOed by double targeting before it moves. To work around Fake Out, exert pressure using Grimmsnarl's partner. Grimmsnarl is typically paired with Terapagos or Kyogre to allow them to shrug off hits as they sweep. Rillaboom and Incineroar are other good options to pair with Grimmsnarl, as their support kit adds to the overall longevity of the team, allowing for stronger Pokemon to get more attacks off. Rillaboom in particular is one of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame that uses Fake Out, which makes it a great option to lead alongside Grimmsnarl to ensure dual screens are set up. Iron Hands and Urshifu-R are also common partners for Grimmsnarl. Iron Hands also provides Fake Out support and a pivoting move, and its Fighting-type STAB option is useful for doing damage to opposing Incineroar, which can use Taunt to disable Grimmsnarl's support moves. Urshifu-R can remove threats to Grimmsnarl like Incineroar and use Taunt to stop foes from using status moves like Taunt and Spore, which stop Grimmsnarl from using its support tools.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Indeedee-F's typing, ability, and movepool make it an excellent support Pokemon. Its Normal / Psychic typing allows it to deal with Calyrex-S well, and Psychic Surge has immense utility in Regulation G, as it blocks priority moves like Fake Out from Incineroar and Rillaboom and Prankster Taunt from Tornadus while also denying the Terrains that power up Miraidon and Rillaboom. The combination of Follow Me and Trick Room allows Indeedee-F to threaten either setting up Trick Room itself or redirecting away attacking moves and Taunt to enable a partner to set up Trick Room. Once the dimensions have been twisted, it can use Helping Hand to make a partner Trick Room sweeper even more threatening. Its last move is usually an attacking move to make it less prone to Taunt; Dazzling Gleam pairs well with Tera Fairy and lets it damage both foes, while Psychic gives it a strong Psychic Terrain-boosted STAB move regardless of Tera type. Alluring Voice is an acceptable alternative to Dazzling Gleam, letting Indeedee-F punish setup sweepers like IronPress Zamazenta-C and Nasty Plot Calyrex-S while also bypassing the prominent Wide Guard. The Fairy-type attacks allow Indeedee-F to break Focus Sashes on Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Urshifu so its partner can remove them quickly. However, Psychic allows Indeedee-F to OHKO Urshifu-R. Psychic Seed complements Psychic Surge well, as it reinforces Indeedee-F's special bulk. Safety Goggles allows it to bypass Amoonguss's Rage Powder and redirect away Spore for the benefit of its teammates, while Rocky Helmet lets it damage physical attackers whose contact moves it can redirect; Rocky Helmet can even break a Focus Sash from an Urshifu or Chien-Pao and severely punish Urshifu-R for using Surging Strikes. Tera Fairy allows Indeedee-F to resist the Dark-type attacks that would otherwise threaten it such as Incineroar's Knock Off and Urshifu's Wicked Blow while powering up Fairy-type moves that it may carry. Alternatively, Tera Grass lets it bypass Amoonguss's disruption and become immune to its Spore without having to use Safety Goggles while also granting a resistance to Water- and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R and Miraidon.</p> <p>With Indeedee-F's utility, it can fit on a variety of teams that appreciate Psychic Terrain, redirection, or its ability to set Trick Room. Calyrex-S appreciates Psychic Terrain blocking priority moves, namely Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, and powering up its Psychic-type attacks; it is even able to run the devastating Expanding Force with Indeedee-F. Calyrex-S also takes advantage of Indeedee-F's redirection to fire off more of its brutal attacks without fear of retaliation and also benefits from Helping Hand pushing its damage potential up to eleven. Calyrex-I pairs well with Indeedee-F, as it is both a Trick Room setter and a sweeper, meaning that the opponent is hard-pressed to stop either Pokemon from setting up Trick Room with Indeedee-F's support, and once it is set up, Indeedee-F immediately enables Calyrex-I to deal big damage with Helping Hand. Other Trick Room sweepers like Ursaluna, Ursaluna-B, and Torkoal appreciate that Indeedee-F can support them with Helping Hand and Follow Me on top of its ability to set up Trick Room. Indeedee-F is very vulnerable to Dark-types like Urshifu, Chi-Yu, and Incineroar, as the threat of their powerful moves makes it more hesitant to use Follow Me. It also hates Taunt, which completely shuts down all of its utility and thus its field presence. Rillaboom can also interfere with strategies predicated on Psychic Terrain blocking Fake Out.</p>"

Play Rough threatens Koraidon and common Steel-resistant foes like Raging Bolt, Iron Hands, and Urshifu-R. Swords Dance allows Zacian-C to boost past Incineroar's Intimidate and remain a strong threat on the field. Sacred Sword can be used over either of these to threaten a 2HKO on Pokemon Zacian-C may otherwise struggle to break through, such as Incineroar and Zamazenta-C. Tera Blast can be used in conjunction with Tera Ground to also threaten Incineroar and Zamazenta-C, as well as Tera Electric Miraidon, Tera Fire Koraidon, and Gholdengo. However, Tera Blast can't break through IronPress Zamazenta-C and requires Zacian-C to commit to Terastallizaion. The defensive EVs allow Zacian-C to survive +3 Body Press from Zamazenta-C and avoid the 2HKO from Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage, while the Attack investment provides Zacian-C with the ability to 2HKO bulky Calyrex-S with Behemoth Blade after Intimidate. The Speed EVs allow Zacian-C to outspeed 135 speed foes that have a neutral nature, such as Modest Miraidon. Zacian-C may opt for 108 Attack and 164 Speed with a Jolly nature, to outspeed Base 135s with a boosting nature, like Jolly Chien-Pao. Tera Fairy sheds Zacian-C's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-type moves such as Chi-Yu's Heat Wave and Ursaluna-B's Earth Power and greatly boosts its damage, allowing Zacian-C to OHKO Kyogre and Terastallized Miraidon. Tera Ground grants Zacian-C incredible coverage and an immunity to Miraidon's Electric-type STAB moves. Alternatively, Tera Dragon provides Zacian-C with valuable resistances to Water-, Electric-, and Fire-type moves, allowing it to take attacks from threats like Urshifu-R, Miraidon, and Chi-Yu significantly better.</p> <p>Zacian-C especially struggles with Incineroar, which weakens it through Intimidate and can further cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or threaten it with Flare Blitz. Zacian-C also struggles to damage Fire- and Steel-types like Ogerpon-H, Tera Fire Calyrex-I, Gholdengo, and Zamazenta-C if not packing coverage. This makes Urshifu-R an excellent partner, as it can threaten all of Zacian-C's checks and appreciates how Zacian-C reliably removes Raging Bolt and Miraidon. Chien-Pao can use Sacred Sword to threaten Zamazenta-C and Incineroar, as well as help Zacian-C break through the above checks with Sword of Ruin. Tailwind from Pokemon like Tornadus and Whimsicott is greatly appreciated, allowing Zacian-C to maintain its Speed advantage against opposing speed control. Amooonguss can be troublesome, as it takes Zacian-C's attacks well and can slow it down with Spore. In the balance mirror matchup, the Calyrex formes can also be troublesome for Zacian-C, as they are faster in their respective forms of speed control and can output more damage than Zacian-C. Umbreon and Chi-Yu are excellent partners for this reason. Umbreon can utilize its Fake Out immunity to shut down Amoonguss and prevent Trick Room with Taunt while also doing huge damage to both Calyrex formes with Foul Play. Chi-Yu can threaten Amoonguss and the Calyrex formes with Heat Wave and Dark Pulse, respectively. The two also provide Snarl utility to further minimize the threat of Calyrex-S.</p>"

Behemoth Bash can be used instead to threaten a 2HKO on Tera Fairy Raging Bolt and a potential 2HKO on Calyrex-I. Wide Guard is an amazing utility option that can be used over Iron Defense or Protect as it protects against deadly spread moves like Astral Barrage and Water Spout, improving the Calyrex-S and Kyogre matchups considerably. 84 Defense EVs with an Impish nature give Body Press enough power to OHKO Miraidon and 2HKO most Fighting-resistant Pokemon after an Iron Defense boost, most notably Landorus and Tornadus, assuming Dauntless Shield is active. The given special bulk investment allows Zamazenta-C to survive Choice Scarf Chi-Yu's Flamethrower and avoid a 2HKO from most Flutter Mane variants. The Speed investment ensures that Zamazenta-C will outrun Adamant Ogerpon formes. Tera Grass is the most consistent Tera type, keeping Zamazenta-C's Fire weakness and worsens its chances against Flying-types like Tornadus; in exchange, it becomes immune to Amoonguss's powder moves and gains a resistance to Ground- and Electric-type attacks, which helps it greatly against Landorus, Miraidon, and Raging Bolt. Alternatively, Tera Water lets Zamazenta-C shed all of its type weaknesses and gives it key resistances to Fire and Water, the latter of which is especially useful against Kyogre and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>As a bulky setup sweeper, Zamazenta-C performs at its best when its team is built around damage mitigation and redirection strategies, giving it as many opportunities as possible to set up Iron Defense and fire off its attacks. Rillaboom is an excellent partner that helps Zamazenta-C by providing Fake Out support, recovery from Grassy Terrain, speed control with Grassy Glide, and a useful typing that lets it check Miraidon and Kyogre. Incineroar can make Zamazenta-C even more unbreakable on the physical side with Fake Out and Intimidate, and as a Dark-type, it provides an important check to Calyrex-S. Raging Bolt boasts great offensive and defensive synergy with Zamazenta-C, picking off weakened targets with Thunderclap while helping against Kyogre and Urshifu-R; it can also run an effective Calm Mind set that appreciates the support options that Zamazenta-C wants on its team anyway. Redirectors like Amoonguss and Ogerpon-W give Zamazenta-C even more setup opportunities, and the former can take this a step further by disabling foes with Spore and healing Zamazenta-C with Pollen Puff. Flutter Mane can slow down faster Pokemon with Icy Wind or help break physical tanks with a Choice Specs set; either way, it's great for threatening faster Restricted Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Calyrex-S. Ting-Lu can augment Zamazenta-C's special bulk with Vessel of Ruin, check Miraidon and Calyrex-S, and chip foes into Body Press's KO range with Ruination.</p>"

It is a versatile pick on many compositions, as its kit does not need much support and is mainly used to enhance a team's offensive pressure with strong attacks. With Tera Dark, Urshifu-S is capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as both Calyrex formes and Flutter Mane as well as bringing most other targets down to low HP, such as Miraidon and Tornadus. Focus Sash helps Urshifu-S remedy its poor defensive typing, while Sucker Punch is able to somewhat bypass Urshifu-S's middling Speed tier.</p> <p>Urshifu-S functions well on many teams, but those with strong speed control are where Urshifu-S shines, particularly Trick Room compositions with Calyrex-I, which appreciate the immediate pressure. Trick Room lets Urshifu-S outspeed threats such as Flutter Mane and Zamazenta-C. Additionally, Unseen Fist ignoring Protect means that it is more risky for foes to attempt to stall out Trick Room turns. Urshifu-S struggles against Pokemon that resist Dark, such as opposing Incineroar and Urshifu, as they nullify Urshifu-S's main benefit in dealing big damage with Wicked Blow. While Close Combat is strong, it's less consistent because it doesnt bypass Intimidate and drops Urshifu-S's defenses. Additionally, many of these threats also outspeed and Urshifu-S for super effective damage, such as the Zamazenta-C and Urshifu-R. However, Pokemon like Amoonguss and Incineroar are able to somewhat make up for these weaknesses. Amoonguss provides redirection, resists Fairy and Fighting, and threatens foes with Spore, while Incineroar offers general utility and Fake Out, which foes can't block with Protect at risk of a attack from Urshifu-S. Tera Fairy is also a popular Tera type, used by foes like Raging Bolt and Calyrex-S, which are problematic for Urshifu-S as it cannot break through Tera Fairy users because they resist its STAB combination</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Urshifu-R is an excellent revenge killer and cleaner against many offensive Pokemon. The Choice Scarf lets Urshifu-R outspeed the dangerous Calyrex-S, meaning that the vast majority of offensive teams get naturally outsped and destroyed by its powerful Surging Strikes or Close Combat, and with Unseen Fist, these teams cannot even attempt to outplay it with Protect. U-turn lets Urshifu-R use the threat of its powerful attacks to pivot out, letting its team maintain momentum even when the opponent tries to switch around its attacks while also letting it 2HKO Ogerpon-W. Aqua Jet lets Urshifu-R bypass opposing speed control and priority moves when revenge killing an opposing threat, whereas Coaching makes partner Calyrex-I a significantly bigger threat. Tera Water powers up its Surging Strikes, letting it destroy foes like Calyrex-S. It also lets Urshifu-R shed its weaknesses to Psychic and Fairy, letting it potentially take attacks like Flutter Mane's Dazzling Gleam and Calyrex-S's Psychic-type moves. This set maximizes both Urshifu-R's Attack and Speed to make it as fast and strong as possible, but an EV spread of 60 HP / 156 Atk / 20 Def / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature can be also used to survive Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Mystic Water Kyogre's Water Spout.</p> <p>Redirectors such as Rage Powder Amoonguss and Follow Me Ogerpon-W disrupt Urshifu-R very effectively, interfering with it attacking vulnerable targets. Rillaboom's Grassy Glide bypasses Urshifu-R's great Speed and threatens it with an OHKO. Miraidon and Raging Bolt both threaten Urshifu-R with their powerful Electro Drift and Thunderclap, respectively. Koraidon, Groudon, and even Tornadus can set up sun, weakening Surging Strikes so that Urshifu-R can be played around more easily. Additionally, a good way to subvert Urshifu-R's great Speed is with opposing speed control. Users include Tailwind Tornadus, Icy Wind Flutter Mane, and Trick Room Calyrex-I or Farigiraf. Urshifu-R's best partner is Tornadus, as it can support Urshifu-R with Tailwind to counter opposing speed control, Rain Dance to boost the power of Urshifu-R's Water-type STAB moves, and Bleakwind Storm to threaten opposing Grass-types like Rillaboom that would threaten Urshifu-R. It can also use Taunt to ensure that Amoonguss cannot use Spore or Rage Powder to disrupt Urshifu-R. Pelipper provides rain with its ability and has a STAB Flying-type attack in Hurricane to threaten Grass-types, and it can use Wide Guard to protect Urshifu-R from the variety of spread moves in the format, including Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and Water Spout from Kyogre. It also can support Urshifu-R with Helping Hand. Amoonguss can handle Electric- and Grass-types that would threaten Urshifu-R by redirecting attacks away from it with Rage Powder. Urshifu-R forms a formidable pivoting core with Rillaboom and Incineroar, with the three spamming U-turn or Parting Shot to stay ahead of the opponent's switches, reactivate Fake Out, cycle Intimidate, and let Urshifu-R choose new moves to lock into. Incineroar helps take on opposing Rillaboom and Amoonguss for Urshifu-R, while Rillaboom deals with Kyogre and opposing Urshifu-R well and slows down Miraidon. Both of them can use Fake Out to prevent one of the opposing Pokemon from attacking, letting Urshifu-R attack the other without interference. Fake Out also often forces foes to use Protect, which Urshifu-R can attack through.</p>"

Taunt is utilized to shut down supportive Pokemon and Trick Room setters such as Amoonguss and Farigiraf as well as prevent Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos and Raging Bolt from setting up. Aqua Jet is a great alternative to get around Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and pick off weakened foes, which is especially useful, as Urshifu-R ignores Protect. Urshifu-R may opt for Swords Dance to become a deadly sweeper, allowing it to OHKO Rillaboom and, after Intimidate, Terapagos-S with Close Combat. Mystic Water boosts Urshifu-R's STAB moves without drawback and allows it to OHKO Incineroar through Sitrus Berry. Safety Goggles lets Urshifu-R ignore Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder, which is significant, as Amoonguss resists Urshifu-R's STAB moves; this also provides opportunities for Urshifu-R to set up. The defensive investment allows Urshifu-R to survive Rillaboom's Miracle Seed-boosted Grassy Glide and almost always survive Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. The Speed EVs allow Urshifu-R to outspeed -1 Flutter Mane and Miraidon. Tera Water sheds Urshifu-R's weaknesses to Flutter Mane's Fairy-type STAB moves, Calyrex-S's Psyshock, and Pelipper's Hurricane, as well as greatly boosting its damage output, allowing it to 2HKO Calyrex-I with Surging Strikes and OHKO Chi-Yu with Aqua Jet once Terastallized. Urshifu-R may use Tera Grass to obtain resistances to Rillaboom and Raging Bolt's priority attacks as well as a Spore and Rage Powder immunity. Tera Ghost can be opted for instead to provide Urshifu-R with a Fake Out immunity, allowing it to keep momentum, and a Fighting immunity that lets Urshifu-R take on Zamazenta-C.</p> <p>Urshifu-R struggles against Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, which take its attacks exceptionally well and threaten it with strong priority STAB moves. Ogerpon-W is also an issue, as it can redirect Surging Strikes and is faster, allowing it to hit Urshifu-R for huge damage with Horn Leech. This makes Tornadus and Amoonguss great partners, as Tornadus can threaten the Grass-types, and Amoonguss can protect Urshifu-R from Raging Bolt with Rage Powder. Tornadus can also provide speed and weather control, making up for Urshifu-R's mediocre Speed tier and handling the otherwise problematic Koraidon, which can significantly weaken Urshifu-R with the sun it sets up. Taunt is another great tool that allows Tornadus to shut down Amoonguss for Urshifu-R. Urshifu-R can take on threats like Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu for the two in return. Alternatively, Rillaboom is an excellent pick, as it can pivot in Urshifu-R and threaten Ogerpon-W. Incineroar can pair with Urshifu-R and either Amoonguss or Rillaboom to create a fantastic pivot core, switching in on threats like Rillaboom. Rillaboom and Incineroar also bring Fake Out, which synergises with Unseen Fist. Urshifu-R is also a great asset to Calyrex-S, as it has the ability to remove Ghost-resistant foes like Incineroar and Terapagos.</p>"

It has a great matchup into Incineroar, since it ignores Intimidate with its signature move Surging Strikes, can switch into Chien-Pao and Calyrex-I, and is able to deal significant damage to Terapagos with Close Combat. Aqua Jet is almost unstoppable with Unseen Fist and can pick off Pokemon low on HP or deal damage before Urshifu-R gets KOed. Taunt gives it a much better matchup into Amoonguss, shutting it down almost completely, and it prevents Calyrex-I from setting up Trick Room. Focus Sash gives it more survivability and helps with its relatively low Special Defense. Tera Water allows Urshifu-R to deal incredibly high damage with Surging Strikes, allowing for an OHKO against common threats such as Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao through Focus Sash. Tera Stellar lets it OHKO Terapagos-S with Close Combat but loses the consistency of Tera Water, since Urshifu-R can no longer use boosted Surging Strikes repeatedly.</p> <p>Urshifu-R works incredibly well in Calyrex-S teams, since it can threaten the Normal- and Dark-types that Calyrex-S struggles with, such as Terapagos and Incineroar. In exchange, Calyrex-S can deal with Raging Bolt, which is one of the most common checks to Urshifu-R, as Raging Bolt can use Thunderclap before Urshifu-R can move to bring it down to Focus Sash while also being able to switch-in on Surging Strikes. Urshifu-R synergizes well with Rillaboom and Incineroar, since Fake Out and Unseen Fist are a deadly combination, punishing passive plays such as Protect that try to avoid the flinching turn. Their typings also have incredible synergy with each other, allowing them to switch in on many attacks that Urshifu-R is threatened by. With its great physical bulk and natural type advantage, Rillaboom is a great check to it, slowing Urshifu-R down with Fake Out or doing high damage to it with Wood Hammer or Grassy Glide. Urshifu-R also struggles with Amoonguss, which is able to completely wall it while protecting its teammates with Rage Powder or putting it to sleep with Spore. Tornadus is a good partner for Urshifu-R, helping with its average Speed stat by setting up Tailwind, heavily increasing the damage Urshifu-R does while making the Koraidon matchup easier by using Rain Dance and threatening the Grass-types which could otherwise be problematic such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom with Bleakwind Storm. Koraidon and Miraidon are some of the Restricted Pokemon that have the best matchup into Urshifu-R, as Koraidon is able to set up sun and greatly reduce its damage, while Miraidon is able to outspeed it and bring it down to Focus Sash while also pivoting out with Volt Switch.</p>"

Pokemon that can take an attack from Calyrex-S, such as Incineroar, Chi-Yu, and Assault Vest Raging Bolt and Iron Hands, are also checks to Calyrex-S, since they can retaliate with powerful attacks of their own, while the former two can OHKO it with super effective Dark-type moves.

        "description": "<p>Calyrex-S is the number one threat in the Regulation G metagame, boasting an immensely powerful Astral Barrage off its phenomenal Special Attack and Speed that 2HKOes most of the metagame. Its access to Nasty Plot, shooting up its Special Attack to astronomical levels, in conjunction with its ability to hit most Pokemon for neutral or super effective damage like Rillaboom and Calyrex-I make it a Pokemon that every team needs to be more than adequately prepared for. Calyrex-S's Ghost typing crucially allows it to be immune to Fake Out from the likes of Incineroar and Rillaboom. Psyshock hits specially defensive Pokemon like Calm Mind Terapagos and Raging Bolt and those holding Assault Vest like Rillaboom hard. Psychic can be run instead to guarantee an OHKO on Urshifu-R, since Psyshock is a damage roll to do so. Alternatively, Draining Kiss lets Calyrex-S hit Dark-types such as Urshifu-S while maintaining longevity. Tera Blast can, however, be run over Draining Kiss in conjunction with Tera Fairy for higher power. Focus Sash ensures that Calyrex-S gets at least two attacks off thanks to its high Speed. Tera Ghost boosts Astral Barrage even further, leaving only Incineroar that can survive it at +2. Tera Fairy allows Calyrex-S to easily take Wicked Blow, Sucker Punch, and Knock Off from the likes of Urshifu-S, Chien-Pao, and Incineroar, respectively, while also powering up its own Fairy-type move of choice.</p> <p>Calyrex-S, though highly oppressive with Astral Barrage alone, faces difficulty wearing down the ubiquitous Incineroar while also being completely unable to hit Terapagos with Astral Barrage. Urshifu-R helps Calyrex-S with this beautifully, threatening both of its mentioned checks and also boasting good matchups against other Dark-types in Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S. Incineroar and Rillaboom are also good allies as they provide Calyrex-S with Fake Out and recovery, letting it set up Nasty Plot more easily. Clefairy and Amoonguss are other good allies, as they redirect attacks away from Calyrex-S, allowing it to fire off Astral Barrage safely. The former also bolsters Calyrex-S's bulk with Friend Guard and can help it almost always move first even under Trick Room, thanks to After You; this is important because Calyrex-S is very vulnerable under the twisted dimensions. Amoonguss can heal it via Pollen Puff.</p>"

Tera Blast is often seen in this slot, as both before and after Terastallization, it gives Farigiraf a consistent single-target STAB move. Foul Play is used to give Farigiraf a way to hit both Calyrex formes for super effective damage, being able to 2HKO both. Electric Seed is used in tandem with Miraidon, and gives Farigiraf more bulk, allowing it to stick around longer to support the team with Helping Hand and Armor Tail. Sitrus Berry allows Farigiraf to disrupt the opponent for longer than it would be able to without it. It can also help live some double-ups to help safely get Trick Room up, such as Surging Strikes + Knock Off from Urshifu-R and Incineroar, respectively. Safety Goggles is for if your team has a particularly bad matchup into Amoonguss and Farigiraf wants to be able to set up Trick Room without being put to sleep without Electric Terrain support from Miraidon. The HP and Special Defense EVs allow Farigiraf to live a Choice Specs Beads of Ruin single target Tera Starstorm from Terapagos, and the rest is put into Defense.

It also struggles against fast Taunt users, such as Speed Booster Energy Flutter Mane, due to them being able to prevent Trick Room from going up, and bulky Dark-types like Incineroar, as Farigiraf can't hit them very hard without Tera Ground. Incineroar in particular can force a Tera with Knock Off. Miraidon and Farigiraf are great partners for each other, as Farigiraf stops Miraidon from being interrupted by Fake Out, which is particularly important for the Choice Specs set and Miraidon can activate the Electric Seed, making Farigiraf even bulkier, and as previously mentioned, Farigiraf can even Tera Ground so Miraidon can freely click Discharge next to it while the Electric Terrain makes Farigiraf immune to Amoonguss's Spore. Farigiraf itself benefits from partners that can help it set Trick Room, such as bulky Fake Out users like Incineroar and Rillaboom, as well as redirectors like Amoonguss and the Ogerpon formes. Trick Room sweepers also like having Farigiraf as a partner; for example, Calyrex-I loves the boost from Helping Hand, and so does Ursaluna-B.

Encore allows Scream Tail to lock foes into passive moves such as Protect, Fake Out, and Taunt, giving its teammates opportunities to setup or attack as well as discouraging opponents from using the latter two moves to hinder setup. Disable is used similarly but can instead prevent opponents from going for attacks that would hit Scream Tail or its partners for large amounts of damage; Encore also disables moves that Pokemon are forced to use, either through Choice items or Scream Tail using Encore. Dazzling Gleam and Play Rough give Scream Tail a way to deal chip damage: Dazzling Gleam can bypass redirection from Pokemon like Amoonguss, while Play Rough can hit Pokemon such as Pelipper that use Wide Guard; both also potentially break a Focus Sash. Booster Energy allows Scream Tail to outspeed Pokemon like Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and threaten to use Disable and Encore. The Special Defense EVs allow Scream Tail to survive Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage or a Shadow Ball from Choice Specs Flutter Mane, while the Defense EVs let Scream Tail almost always survive one Wood Hammer from Choice Band Rillaboom.

Flutter Mane is especially effective against Pokemon that rely on their speed, such as Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Calyrex-S, as it can threaten to OHKO or slow them down before they move. Taunt can be used instead of Shadow Ball to shut down support Pokemon like Amoonguss and Clefairy, as well as prevent Terapagos from setting up. Flutter Mane can also opt for Thunder Wave to reduce the Speed of Clear Amulet and Covert Cloak Pokemon such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S. Icy Wind is mandatory for Flutter Mane to play as speed control, slowing down both opposing Pokemon while also breaking Focus Sash from the likes of Chien-Pao and the Urshifu formes. Booster Energy allows Flutter Mane to outspeed the entire metagame and become a stronger form of speed control. The EV spread enables Flutter Mane to survive strong physical attacks such as Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance, Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash, and almost always Adamant Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. The Special Defense lets it take Volt Switch from Modest Choice Specs Miraidon and Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B. Meanwhile, the Speed investment lets Flutter Mane outspeed neutral nature base 135 Speed Pokemon like Miraidon and Chien-Pao. Tera Fairy is great on Flutter Mane to shed its weakness to Ghost-type attacks such as Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and boost its damage output, allowing Flutter Mane to threaten a potential OHKO on Miraidon and ensure a 2HKO on Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Flutter Mane struggles against bulky physical attackers like Assault Vest Rillaboom and Iron Hands, which can sponge its attacks, don't mind becoming slower, and threaten an OHKO in return. Zacian-C and Zamazenta-C are major issues in a similar way, but they don't enjoy having their Speed reduced. Flutter Mane also struggles to keep up with more immediate speed control, specifically Prankster Tailwind from Tornadus and Whimsicott, that may allow slower Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Miraidon to threaten it. Flutter Mane pairs well with a variety of Pokemon, namely offensive Pokemon that can utilize its speed control. Chi-Yu exploits this especially well, threatening Zacian-C, Zamazenta-C, and Rillaboom with Heat Wave and Overheat. Chi-Yu also makes up for Flutter Mane's lack of offensive investment with Beads of Ruin and appreciates Flutter Mane's ability to threaten Dragon-types. Choice Specs Terapagos is an excellent asset for this duo, as it takes advantage of how often Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu can force Terastallization. Zamazenta-C can protect Flutter Mane from threatening spread moves such as Astral Barrage and Glacial Lance from the Calyrex formes. Terapagos and Zamazenta-C also appreciate Flutter Mane's speed control making up for their mediocre speed tiers, and its Fairy typing that threatens Koraidon.</p>"

Since Flutter Mane is immune to Fake Out, it can ignore the threat of Fake Out to use Taunt on Pokemon such as Calyrex-I or Amoonguss as well as being able to attack without having to fear the chip damage that the move does. Flutter Mane can use support moves such as Taunt over Shadow Ball to prevent opposing Pokemon like Calyrex-I or Amoonguss from setting Trick Room or using moves like Spore, respectively. When paired with Pokemon that set sun such as Koraidon or Groudon, Flutter Mane can use Protosynthesis to boost its Speed and use Icy Wind as a form of speed control, outspeeding and slowing down Pokemon such as Calyrex-S. Dazzling Gleam gives Flutter Mane a spread option that it can boost with Terastallization. Focus Sash lets Flutter Mane live a hit without needing to invest EVs in bulk. Tera Fairy and Stellar both allow Flutter Mane to OHKO Raging Bolt; Tera Stellar allows Shadow Ball to pick up KOs like those against all opposing Flutter Mane. However, Tera Fairy is more consistent, since it can use Fairy-type STAB moves without worrying about losing the boost.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Urshifu-R threatens Flutter Mane when paired with Pokemon such as Tornadus or Pelipper that can set rain for it, removing both Flutter Mane's Speed boost and the sun. Assault Vest Rillaboom can take Flutter Mane's attacks, threaten it with Wood Hammer, and finish it off on the subsequent turn with Grassy Glide. Flutter Mane pairs well with Pokemon that can redirect attacks away from it such as Ogerpon and Amoonguss, since this allows it to maintain its Focus Sash and stay on the field longer. In addition to redirecting attacks, Amoonguss matches up well into Urshifu-R. Raging Bolt can remove Pokemon such as Urshifu-R that threaten Flutter Mane while also reliably switching into Rillaboom's Wood Hammer and Grassy Glide.

Power Gem provides good coverage for Fire-type Pokemon like Incineroar and Ogerpon-H, Taunt is a good way to shut down support Pokemon like Amoonguss and Farigiraf, and Icy Wind is great speed control. Choice Specs increases Flutter Mane's offense even further, as it can OHKO Pokemon such as Assault Vest Raging Bolt. The EV spread allows Flutter Mane to outspeed Chien-Pao, Koraidon, and Miraidon without Speed-boosting natures and live an Ice Spinner from Adamant Chien-Pao.

Incineroar is a good teammate for Flutter Mane, as Intimidate can help Flutter Mane shore up its poor Defense while also having a resistance against Dark- and Ghost-type moves.

Iron Hands has a solid matchup against opposing Miraidon teams, as it is one of the few Pokemon capable of surviving a Hadron Engine-boosted Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Miraidon. In addition to that, Iron Hands matches up well against Terapagos and threatens it with Drain Punch. It also helps deal with Calyrex-I Trick Room teams by providing Fake Out support and utilizing its low speed to outspeed and KO Incineroar in Trick Room as well as trade decently with Calyrex-I in Electric Terrain by utilizing its Tera. Wild Charge is used over Thunder Punch, as it OHKOes Urshifu-R and, in Electric Terrain, 2HKOes Calyrex-I. The recoil damage can be compensated through Drain Punch recovery. Close Combat can be used on more offensively oriented teams to get some quick OHKOs on the likes of Incineroar, and Terapagos in Electric Terrain. Volt Switch is used so Iron Hands can be a slow pivot, which helps as a positioning tool. Ice Punch provides a way to 2HKO Amoonguss and Raging Bolt as well as OHKO the occasional Landorus. Meanwhile, Heavy Slam functions as a way to get quick KOs against the likes of Flutter Mane and Tera Fairy Calyrex-S outside of Electric Terrain. Assault Vest boosts Iron Hands's mediocre Special Defense stat. The defensive investment helps Iron Hands survive two Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R as well as two Body Presses from Zamazenta-C. Iron Hands's Special Defense is maximized to take full advantage of Assault Vest, while the Speed investment allows Iron Hands to outspeed Regidrago under Tailwind. The Attack EVs, meanwhile, ensure Quark Drive boosts its Attack stat even after an Intimidate. Tera Grass can be used to gain immunity to Spore and Rage Powder as well as a resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Landorus's Earth Power, whereas Tera Water gives Iron Hands an excellent defensive typing, allowing it to resist Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I. Tera Fairy is a solid defensive typing that is neutral into most of the metagame. Its immunity to Dragon helps as well when facing Miraidon and Regidrago.</p> <p>Iron Hands is particularly weak to faster setup teams, with foes like Tera Grass Clefairy and Amoonguss that can take hits from Iron Hands and redirect its moves, allowing Calyrex-S to set up with Nasty Plot. Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus and Groudon can wall Iron Hands and threaten to 2HKO it. As a physical attacker, Iron Hands naturally struggles against Intimidate users like Incineroar as well as Defense-boosting Pokemon like Zamazenta-C that can set up Iron Defense, essentially walling Iron Hands. Miraidon naturally complements Iron Hands thanks to its Hadron Engine, as well as functioning as a fast offensive attacker capable of OHKOing all of the aforementioned checks. Meanwhile, a Trick Room setter such as Farigiraf provides excellent speed control to take advantage of Iron Hands's mediocre Speed tier. Farigiraf prevents any opposing Pokemon from using Fake Out thanks to Armor Tail while also having access to Helping Hand, which further boosts Iron Hands's offensive capabilities. Slower powerhouses like Ursaluna-B complement Iron Hands by threatening Incineroar and Zamazenta-C, as well as forming a solid Trick Room core with Farigiraf. Pokemon that fit well on a slower playstyle like Incineroar and Amoonguss also work well with Iron Hands by providing Fake Out, Intimidate, redirection and recovery to form a well-rounded balance core.</p>"

Gholdengo has good matchups into common Restricted Pokemon such as Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C. Nasty Plot is used to allow Gholdengo to set up and sweep opposing teams. Leftovers gives Gholdengo more longevity, while Metal Coat is used so it can OHKO Flutter Mane with unboosted Make It Rain. The Special Attack investment allows Gholdengo to always 2HKO Zamazenta-C with +2 Shadow Ball, while the defensive investment allows Gholdengo to survive Origin Pulse from Mystic Water Kyogre and Flare Blitz from Incineroar. The Speed investment allows Gholdengo to outspeed Pelipper. Tera Normal is used to give Gholdengo an immunity to threatening Ghost-type moves such as Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and Shadow Ball from Flutter Mane, while Tera Water is used because it is a good defensive typing overall while allowing Gholdengo to resist Fire-type attacks.</p> <p>Common checks to Gholdengo consist of Incineroar, Chi-Yu, Assault Vest Raging Bolt, and Calyrex-S. Chi-Yu and Calyrex-S outspeed and threaten to OHKO Gholdengo.

Urshifu-R and Pelipper are also great partners, as they can deal with Calyrex-S, Chi-Yu, and Incineroar thanks to Pelipper's combination of Drizzle, Wide Guard, and Weather Ball and Urshifu-R's ability to outspeed and threaten all three of them with Surging Strikes. Calyrex-I and Koraidon are strong Gholdengo partners, since Gholdengo can help deal with threats such as Zamazenta-C and Zacian-C and appreciates how the two threaten Incineroar.

Trick is used to cripple support and setup Pokemon like Amoonguss and Terapagos or force Pokemon that set Trick Room such as Calyrex-I to switch out. Nasty Plot gives Gholdengo the option to set up once it has used Trick. Power Gem hits Fire-types that resist Make It Rain such as Incineroar, Chi-Yu, and Ogerpon-H. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam threatens Pokemon like Miraidon and Koraidon. Choice Specs allows Gholdengo to use its strong Steel- and Ghost-type attacks to immediately threaten Pokemon like Calyrex-I, especially if it uses Tera Steel. The EV spread allows Gholdengo to survive Choice Specs Miraidon's Volt Switch, Incineroar's Flare Blitz, and Kyogre's Mystic Water-boosted Origin Pulse and OHKO bulky Flutter Mane sets with Shadow Ball. The Speed EVs let it outspeed the Ogerpon formes when they are at -1. Tera Steel lets Gholdengo OHKO Landorus and Tera Fairy Assault Vest Raging Bolt, and if Gholdengo is paired with speed control providers such as Tailwind Tornadus and Icy Wind Flutter Mane, it can run it to boost Make It Rain even further. Tera Dragon allows Gholdengo to resist Fire-type attacks such as Koraidon's Flare Blitz and Groudon's Heat Crash as well as Miraidon's Electro Drift and Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. Tera Water also lets Gholdengo resist Fire- and Water-type attacks like Kyogre's Water Spout and Koraidon's Flare Blitz while not making it weak to Ice- and Fairy-type attacks such as Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> <p>Incineroar resists Gholdengo's STAB combination while threatening it with Flare Blitz and Knock Off. Chi-Yu similarly checks Gholdengo while also outspeeding and threatening an OHKO on it with Dark Pulse or Overheat. Assault Vest Raging Bolt resists Make It Rain and avoids the 2HKO from Shadow Ball. As for teammates, Gholdengo pairs well with Terapagos, since Gholdengo walls Zamazenta-C, while Terapagos matches up well against Calyrex-S and can switch into Ghost-type attacks. Gholdengo also pairs well with Calyrex-I, since it can check Zamazenta-C and Zacian-C, which Calyrex-I struggles with. Gholdengo additionally has great synergy with Pelipper due to rain reducing Gholdengo's weakness to Fire and Pelipper threatening Fire-types that resist Make It Rain such as Incineroar and Chi-Yu.

Removing Psychic Terrain can allow Chien-Pao to threaten Calyrex-S with a super effective Sucker Punch. Alternatively, Icicle Crash hits less consistently, but it avoids Rocky Helmet damage, can cause foes to flinch, and keeps up Terrains that would benefit Chien-Pao. Sucker Punch gives Chien-Pao a priority option that can KO faster Pokemon such as Speed Booster Energy Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle. Sacred Sword allows Chien-Pao to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB moves like Incineroar and Zamazenta-C. Chien-Pao can run Throat Chop as a consistent Dark-type STAB attack that can hit Lunala and Calyrex-S even if they didn't use an attacking move.

Rocky Helmet threatens constant chip damage on Pokemon like Urshifu-R. The EV investment allows Ting-Lu to survive a Wood Hammer from Assault Vest Rillaboom and take two Moonblast from Speed Booster Energy Flutter Mane for the Rocky Helmet set. The Attack investment allows Ting-Lu to OHKO Flutter Mane with Heavy Slam and to 2HKO Raging Bolt and bulky Farigiraf with Stomping Tantrum and Throat Chop, respectively. Tera Poison is utilized to resist the Urshifu formes's Close Combat, Rillaboom's STAB moves, and Flutter Mane's Moonblast.

Ting-Lu struggles against strong super effective attacks from Pokemon like Rillaboom, Kyogre, and the Urshifu formes. Raging Bolt is a great partner to Ting-Lu, as it can threaten Urshifu-R and Kyogre for super effective damage and resist Grass-type STAB moves from Rillaboom. Incineroar and Amoonguss are a great duo that support Ting-Lu well. Incineroar slows down Rillaboom thanks to Intimidate and threatens super effective damage with Flare Blitz.

Snarl threatens a common Restricted core that revolves around redirection—Calyrex and Clefairy—and it can be used to chip away and weaken the damage output of bulkier specially offensive threats like Raging Bolt and Terapagos. On the other hand, Tera Blast is tailored to the Choice Scarf set, which commonly runs Tera Ground to threaten large amounts of damage to Miraidon, Raging Bolt, and Incineroar. Choice Specs allows Chi-Yu to pick up OHKOs on Pokemon like Assault Vest Rillaboom and Calyrex-I with Heat Wave and bulky Pelipper with Dark Pulse. Choice Scarf enables Chi-Yu to outspeed common fast metagame staples such as Chien-Pao, Calyrex-S, and Flutter Mane without Protosynthesis Speed activated.

Zacian-C, Groudon, Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Calyrex-I, and Landorus can threaten Raging Bolt before and after it Terastallizes.</p>"

  "Iron Crown": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Crown is an excellent choice for offensive teams looking to take advantage of the powerful move Expanding Force thanks to its well-rounded stats and access to Booster Energy. It performs best against frailer offensive teams consisting of Pokemon that do not resist Expanding Force, such as Tornadus, Landorus, and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it can be used as a sweeper early-game to soften opposing teams, it is usually better to save Iron Crown for the late-game when its checks have been sufficiently weakened for it to sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indeedee-F is by far Iron Crown's best teammate, offering role compression as a Psychic Terrain setter and redirector. Access to Helping Hand also further amplifies its partner's ridiculous damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Crown's best counters are Dark- and Steel-types, namely Incineroar, Kingambit, Archaludon, and Gholdengo, all of which resist both of Iron Crown's STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore, Iron Crown appreciates Pokemon that can help remove these threats consistently, such as Landorus, Entei, and Urshifu-R. In return, Iron Crown can pressure opposing Urshifu-R and Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rillaboom is another noteworthy check, as it is able to safely pivot in and override Psychic Terrain, weakening Expanding Force significantly. Other Pokemon with access to Ice Spinner like Chien-Pao and Dragonite can also be used to remove Psychic Terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane serve as good checks as well, but they have to watch out for Follow Me from Indeedee-F as they are vulnerable to Tachyon Cutter.</p> </li> </ul>",

  "Terapagos": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Terapagos can be used as a hyper offensive threat with its high Special Attack and powerful spread move, Tera Starstorm. Choice Specs immediately boosts the damage output from Tera Starstorm, allowing Terapagos to pick up early-game KOs, which the more common Calm Mind set cannot. Its natural bulk in addition to Tera Shell allows it to withstand powerful attacks that other hyper offensive threats may not be able to. Terapagos has a very good matchup into the oppressive Calyrex-S with an immunity to Astral Barrage. Teraform Zero disrupts strategies revolving around Miraidon, Groudon and Kyogre's Terrain- and weather-setting abilities. Tera Starstorm is the attack Terapagos will want to use most of the time, but Earth Power and Dark Pulse provide coverage for Steel- and Ghost-types that its partners may not be able to comfortably defeat, like Zamazenta-C and Calyrex-S. Hyper Beam allows Terapagos to pick up KOs around Wide Guard users while Terastallized. Sleep Talk allows Terapagos to continue dealing significant damage even when put to sleep from moves such as Amoonguss's Spore.</p> <p>With a middling Speed stat, Terapagos greatly benefits from Tailwind support, which allows it to outspeed and significantly damage its foes more effectively. Tornadus is the best priority Tailwind setter in the format, so it is naturally a great partner for Choice Specs Terapagos. It also deals super effective damage to Fighting-types that threaten Terapagos like the Urshifu formes. Tornadus can utilize priority Taunt to shut down Wide Guard users, most Trick Room setters, and Spore from opposing Amoonguss. Zamazenta-C is very difficult for Terapagos to defeat because of its natural typing and Wide Guard, so it relies on a partner Chi-Yu to defeat it or cripple its offense with Will-O-Wisp. Chi-Yu easily defeats Steel- and Ghost-types that Terapagos struggles against and provides Beads of Ruin support. Amoonguss provides great redirection support with Rage Powder in the face of threats such as Mienshao and both Urshifu formes, and it can shut down threats with Spore. Pollen Puff benefits Terapagos with healing, reactivating Tera Shell. Flutter Mane can check Koraidon with its natural typing as well as provide Icy Wind and Taunt support. Lunala is tough to break with its high natural bulk and Shadow Shield alongside Wide Guard, but a partner Incineroar can weaken its Special Attack and KO it with Snarl and Knock Off. Ting-Lu's great special bulk thanks to Assault Vest and Vessel of Ruin is very difficult for Terapagos to break through, and it can reduce Terapagos's Special Attack further with Snarl. This makes Urshifu-R a great partner, forcing Ting-Lu to Terastallize to remove its weakness to Urshifu-R's STAB moves while gaining a weakness to Terapagos. Koraidon can survive Tera Starstorm and threaten an OHKO on Terastallized Terapagos in return. A partner Flutter Mane forces Koraidon to Terastallize, making it weak to Terapagos. Pelipper is tough for Terapagos to break due to its access to Wide Guard and immunity to Earth Power, so it appreciates partners such as Raging Bolt to threaten Pelipper.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Terapagos is a bulky setup sweeper, with Tera Shell boosting its already great longevity with its high natural bulk. In addition to this, Tera Starstorm becomes a powerful unresisted spread move when Terapagos Terastallizes. Earth Power is ran to allow Terapagos to deal significant damage to Steel-types and Wide Guard users it otherwise would struggle to defeat, notably Zamazenta-C. Leftovers benefits Terapagos's longevity when it does not have a partner to heal it, allowing Tera Shell to be reactivated. Covert Cloak is also a great item, as it prevents Terapagos's Special Attack from being lowered by opposing Snarl and provides the bonus of making it immune to flinch from Fake Out. Clear Amulet is used similarly to Covert Cloak but also prevents Parting Shot lowering Terapagos's Special Attack. Terapagos matches up very well against Calyrex-S, as it is immune to Astral Barrage, and damage from Draining Kiss and Expanding Force can be mitigated by its massive bulk bolstered by Tera Shell, Special Defense boosts from Calm Mind, and partners such as Amoonguss with Rage Powder and Pollen Puff. Teraform Zero disrupts strategies revolving around Miraidon, Groudon and Kyogre's terrain and weather setting abilities. The given EV spread allows Terapagos to survive Collision Course from Koraidon on the physically defensive side and Electro Drift from Choice Specs Miraidon on the specially defensive side with Tera Shell active or while Terastallized. With the bulk the spread provides, Electro Drift becomes a guaranteed 3HKO with Leftovers recovery after Electric Terrain is removed. The Special Attack investment maximizes the value of Terapagos's Calm Mind boosts, the Speed investment lets it outpace 4 Speed investment Rillaboom, and the HP EVs maximize the recovery gained from Leftovers.</p> <p>Rillaboom is a great partner for Terapagos, providing Grassy Terrain recovery and Fake Out to allow it to gain Calm Mind boosts. Incineroar is another great partner, as it can assist Terapagos in defeating Steel- and Ghost-types with Flare Blitz and Knock Off, as well as providing defensive utility through Intimidate, Parting Shot, and Will-O-Wisp on top of Fake Out. Amoonguss supports Terapagos very well, providing HP recovery with Pollen Puff. Its Rage Powder and Spore also allow Terapagos to safely use Calm Mind. Terapagos struggles to defeat Calyrex-I-centred teams, as it is very reliant on a partner Incineroar to reduce the physical damage it takes and deal super effective damage to Calyrex-I. Zamazenta-C can use Wide Guard, preventing Terapagos from dealing damage with Tera Starstorm while Terastallized, and Terapagos is very reliant on Earth Power as well as partners like Incineroar to deal super effective damage to it. As a result, Gholdengo pairs well with Terapagos, since it reliably checks both Calyrex-I and Zamazenta-C with its natural typing. Koraidon can be troublesome, as it can outdamage Terapagos's teammates' recovery while it is setting up with Calm Mind. Taunt Flutter Mane sets cause huge problems for Terapagos, since it cannot damage Flutter Mane significantly if Flutter Mane has not Terastallized, and Terapagos deals little damage without Calm Mind boosts.</p>"
