  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Blastoise is really useful in UU and should be kept alive as long as possible to keep dangerous Pokemon like Nidoking and Sandslash from sweeping your team. Wish support is not a bad idea, but is hard to pull off, so if you're really insecure about keeping his HP stable I recommend you use Sleep Talk. The longer Blastoise lasts, the more time your other Pokemon have to find a hole in your opponent's team. You would probably use him like you would use your bulky Water-type in standard play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mirror Coat will kill Manectric, Lanturn, Electabuzz and anything else that sends a Thunderbolt at you. The only way it will catch Jolteon is if you also have Earthquake, otherwise it'll just Substitute. Counter works well if Fearow, Tauros or some other physical attacker is trying to take you on one on one, however you're better off using Surf or Ice Beam against all these Rocks and Grounds in UU.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is a more powerful alternative to Surf, but 80% accuracy is less than ideal. Earthquake hits aforementioned Electrics, but not very hard because Blastoise's Attack is average at best, and you probably don't want to stack it to keep your physical walling ability. Hidden Power Electric puts a dent in Mantine; Hidden Power Grass helps against Quagsire, but won't really come handy most of the time. Blastoise can Substitute and Focus Punch but it's not useful at all in UU.</p> <p>Haze and Roar work against Baton Passers and against Reversal / Flail Pokemon to an extent, but is not recommended in UU. Protect keeps Solrock from opening a hole in your team with Explosion and can work in conjunction with Counter or Mirror Coat to check what your opponent can do. Yawn is a fun move: lay down some Spikes beforehand for better results. Toxic is always fun to toy around with, you will be able to poison other Water types, and the standard Electric switches aren't fond of it either.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Blastoise needs max HP with plenty of Defense EVs. A Bold nature would help too. Blastoise tend to run around 200 Speed nowadays to get the first strike on Solrock and company before they Explode, and it's always nice to outrun those Sunnybeaming Grasses you will see in UU.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn resists Surf and hits hard with STAB Electric attacks. Muk's high Special Defense makes it an easy switch in against non-Earthquake versions; Clefable and Slowking also give him trouble. Poliwrath is especially dangerous, because it has Water Absorb, and can Belly Drum on you, unless you have something strange like Hidden Power Grass, or use Roar / Haze.</p>",
    "sets": {"Standard": {"description": "<p>Easy to bring in against many UU teams: Gligar, Sandslash and Solrock are just some examples. Use Sleep Talk if you are lacking something to absorb sleep, but beware that the most common sleepers in UU are Grass-types that can put a hurting in Blastoise. It's mostly useful to keep Blastoise alive and to surprise things like Gligar that try to set up on you while you're sleeping.</p> <p>If you don't want Sleep Talk, you can use Rapid Spin if you're afraid of Spikes. Rapid Spinning against Substitute Qwilfish is not a good idea, so it's a better idea to bring in something to take care of Qwilfish first, and get rid of the Spikes later. Toxic ruins a Lanturn that doesn't carry Rest, as well as several other Waters and Electrics that tend to come in on Blastoise.</p>"}}

  "Raichu": {
    "overview": "<p>Can be a threat to standard teams if your opponent doesn't happen to have Celebi, as it hits about any standard wall quite hard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thief can grab Leftovers from Blissey and Snorlax. Charm can be annoying for Curselax and Swampert. Volt Tackle can give you some extra power, but it can't be used with Surf.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>233 Attack with Focus Punch to 2HKO Blissey in standard. 299 makes you tie with most Salamence for Speed, and 328 makes you faster than stuff like Modest Gengar and the like. Put leftover EVs in Special Attack. When not using Focus Punch, just make sure to max Special Attack for maximal sweeping power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In standard, Venusaur and Celebi can come in easily on Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass, Surf and Focus Punch, taking nil damage thanks to Leftovers and Recover, Leech Seed and / or Synthesis. Even Hidden Power Ice doesn't do that much. Dusclops with around 360 Special Defense can take quite a few Thunderbolts from Raichu if it can Pain Split or Rest in time, and is immune to Focus Punch, while Hidden Powers and Surf don't do much damage. Blissey, Snorlax and Regice must avoid Focus Punch at all costs, so they cannot come in effectively on a Substitute Raichu either, but the rest of its moves don't do much at all. Snorlax might even be able to come in on Substitute and Curse up and come out on top, but beware of Raichu using Encore.</p> <p>Grounds can be used for countering Raichu to an extent. Flygon needs to beware of Hidden Power Ice, and doesn't take Focus Punches too lightly (especially if Flygon is Choice Banded and thus lacks Leftovers recovery), but makes an excellent counter nonetheless because of a guaranteed OHKO with its STAB Earthquake. Claydol is immune to Thunderbolt and resists Focus Punch, but is 3HKOed by Surf and almost 4HKOed by Hidden Power Grass or Ice. It is hard for Raichu to get around Claydol though, since Raichu will have to predict it switching in every time. Donphan is easier to beat but is still a hindrance; it takes nearly no damage from Focus Punch thanks to its high Defense, but Surf and Hidden Power will 2HKO him. Swampert is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass, but every other attack does absolutely nothing to it.</p> <p>In UnderUsed, Camerupt can be almost completely disregarded as a counter because of Surf. Vileplume and Meganium, much like Venusaur and Celebi, take nearly no damage from Focus Punch and Thunderbolt and can shrug it off with Leech Seed and Synthesis. They should watch out a little more for Hidden Power Ice, though. Quagsire and Whiscash do the same job as Swampert: countering any variant not using Hidden Power Grass with no trouble at all. That's why Vileplume or Meganium combined with Quagsire or Whiscash walls any Raichu available. Sandslash and Gligar do the same as Donphan here: being 2HKOed by Surf (and in Sandslash' case, Hidden Power) doesn't cut it, but easily take Focus Punch and Thunderbolt for breakfast. Hypno and Grumpig, the standard special walls of UU, do quite nicely at taking anything Raichu throws at them, though Grumpig has no Wish like Hypno does, so it will get worn down quickly. A sweeping Grumpig doesn't like to get Thunder Waved either.</p> <p>In general, attacking Raichu straight on is a good idea if it doesn't OHKO you. It's very fragile and weak to the most common attacking move in the game (Earthquake), and it often uses Substitute to see what you're going to do. Just switching out if it comes in on your non-attacking move is handy as well, since it is probably going to use Encore.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Encore": {
        "description": "<p>Raichu is one of the fastest Encorers in the game. In standard, play it as follows: come in on a non-attacking move coming from a slower Pokemon and Encore it, then predict what your opponent is going to do. If Blissey, Snorlax or Regice are coming in, Focus Punch on the switch. If you think Swampert is coming, Hidden Power Grass it on the switch--it will not OHKO though. If you're insecure about prediction, use Substitute after Encoring, and handle from there. However, it's recommended to use Hidden Power Grass if your skills allow it, because Swampert is on nearly every team and it greatly hinders Raichu's sweeping potential.</p> <p>For UU play, Focus Punch probably won't come handy, as Thunderbolt will 2HKO Aggron and Clefable is rare, and not much else weak to Fighting is around, besides Golem who you can OHKO with Hidden Power Grass. Therefore, the EVs suggested are for standard play. A guaranteed 2HKO on Blissey with Focus Punch, and enough Speed to outspeed all Heracross.</p>"
      },
      "Special Sweeper with Focus Punch": {"description": "<p>Use this set with Substitute and Hidden Power Grass in UU to get quite a threatening sweeper. Surf is the main reason to use it over Manectric, because it 2HKOs Gligar and OHKOs Camerupt. Only use Hidden Power Ice in standard for Flygon and Salamence (usually doesn't OHKO), because you need Hidden Power Grass in UU for Quagsire. Like with the first set, if you smell a standard Special wall coming, Focus Punch it.</p> <p>When using Focus Punch, use the EVs suggested on the first set. Otherwise, use these. Timid Raichu ties with Jolly Fearow, Dodrio, Linoone and anything else with 100 base Speed and a +Speed nature. Modest ties with the same Pokemon, except with Adamant versions. You'll usually outspeed Salamence as well as the rare Charizard. Use the IVs suggested when using Hidden Power Ice in standard, having absolute max Speed is important.</p>"},
      "Wish": {"description": "<p>Raichu can force switches easily, being an Electric-type. Predict this, Wish, and switch to whatever counters what they sent in. It can stay alive against Blissey by Wishing and then Substituting. Wish prevents it from using Surf, so you are stuck using Hidden Power.</p>"},
      "Reversal": {"description": "<p>OHKOs Blissey and other normal friends and is a nice surprise. They might think you are whittling down yourself to get a Petaya Boost, so take advantage of their surprise. Watch out for Venusaur and Dusclops. Unfortunately, Surf cannot be used in tandem with Reversal. Not really recommended in either UU or standard: in standard Tyranitar messes you up, and in UU there's a lot of Quick Attack and similar moves around.</p>"}

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is usually better suited for your competitive needs because his higher Speed and offenses, in addition to Megahorn, make it a lot easier to pulverize opposing teams. However, Nidoqueen is much better at using Counter due to higher sturdiness. Because of this tankish nature, Nidoqueen is also better at using the nice resistances given to the Poison / Ground typing, but still you should be wary of these nasty weaknesses to Earthquake, Psychic, Ice Beam, and Surf.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter is an awesome move on Nidoqueen, since she usually survives even STAB Earthquakes if she has a defensive EV spread. Charm can be annoying as hell for physical switch-ins like Fearow, Snorlax or any Ground. Roar Nidoqueen can be used for teams based around Baton Pass and it can easily Roar away Ninjask or Scizor as well. Nidoqueen is defensive enough to pull off a Rest / Sleep Talk set, but it's better to use her outstanding versatility. Substitute helps against Weezing if it's not running Flamethrower or Fire Blast.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes SwaQuagsire and Whiscash, but you should be using it on the switch or they will KO you with Earthquake, Surf or Hydro Pump. Use Crunch if you're using a Nidoqueen that's focused on Special Attack (though that's not recommended as it lacks STAB); it will damage Solrock and Misdreavus badly.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you want to OHKO max HP Gligar with Ice Beam guaranteed, you need 200 Special Attack. The main sets should have offensive spreads like suggested, but if you're using Counter or just want a more sturdy Nidoqueen, I recommend using 252 HP / 140 Attack / 36 Defense / 80 Speed with Adamant nature (when not using any special attacks). With this, you survive STAB Earthquakes from the likes of Sandslash. This means you'll be easily living through Nidoking, non-Swords Danced Gligar and any non-STAB Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Nidoqueen is versatile, but since its attacking stats are on the low side it doesn't hurt much if it's not dealing STAB or super effective damage.</p> <p>It's mostly Waters and Grounds that Nidoqueen fears. Politoed, Slowking, and Blastoise take on non-Choice Banded Nidoqueen easily, though they may get worn down after a while. If Nidoqueen is not using Hidden Power Grass, Quagsire and Whiscash are failsafe counters in the same way. Poliwrath usually doesn't run Earthquake or a Water move, but if it does it's a good Nidoqueen counter as well.</p> <p>Sandslash takes Ice Beam even worse than Donphan does, so it's only good as an early game counter that shouldn't switch into Ice Beam, and preferably not into Earthquakes either. Watch out for Sludge Bomb's Poison chance, too, as well as the rare Hidden Power Grass. Gligar can come in with some prediction to avoid Ice Beam, but it cannot OHKO Nidoqueen with Earthquake when Nidoqueen is at (near) full health, so just use it as a finisher. It will get OHKOed by most Ice Beaming Nidoqueen. Solrock, Misdreavus and Lunatone are immune to Earthquake and resist Sludge Bomb, so as long as they don't eat a Shadow Ball they're good counters. Solrock can even set up a Reflect to avoid too much damage. Solrock can Earthquake Nidoqueen (watch out for Counter), Misdreavus can Perish Trap or Calm Mind up, Lunatone can Calm Mind up and use Ice Beam / Psychic.</p>",
    "sets": {"Standard": {"description": "<p>The standard Nidoking set, applied to Nidoqueen.

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>A great movepool that makes him beyond excellent in UU. There's very few surefire counters for Nidoking, especially in the UU environment. He can always surprise you and kill one of the key elements of your team. However, he can be rather hard to bring in due to his common weaknesses to Surf, Ice Beam, Psychic, and Earthquake, and will always have a problem taking down sturdy Water-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nidoking can use Counter on Choice Banders like Fearow, on walls like Solrock or even on Grounds like Quagsire and Sandslash. It does work nicely, but Nidoking is usually better off at attacking straight up. Toxic and Thief can help in wearing down opponents, but once again Nidoking is better off ramming things instead of stalling them out.</p> <p>Thunder does more damage to Waters than Thunderbolt if it hits and it has a high Paralysis chance, but in the long run Thunderbolt's accuracy is better. Roar can help you against UU Baton Passers, but those are rare. Hidden Power Grass is fun on Nidoking to hit Quagsire for a surprise.</p> <p>Rest and Sleep Talk are always a nice option on Pokemon that can take a hit or two. Nidoking can absorb a Sleep from a Grass-type nicely and then surprise them with Sludge Bomb, but it does hurt his great versatility. Protect is nice to scout for Earthquakes, Explosions, and Choice Banded moves, and helps for Leftovers recovery.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you're using Counter on Nidoking, more defensive EVs are suggested. With 88 HP and 28 Defense EVs, you can survive a Gligar Earthquake (as long as he doesn't have an Adamant nature). Nidoking needs 200 Special Attack (the stat, not the amount of EVs) to OHKO Gligar. If you're using a -Special Attack nature (Adamant, for example), you need 68 EVs to reach that. However, without that, Nidoking already has 206 Special Attack, so there's no need to stack it any more. Generally you'll want to focus on Attack to put a little strength behind his Earthquakes, while his Special moves should be designed to kill specific threats like Gligar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Your options are limited. Quagsire, Whiscash, Politoed, Poliwrath, Walrein, and Blastoise work as counters in the same way as the Waters from standard: they do not like Choice Band Earthquakes, and Quagsire and Whiscash do not like Hidden Power Grass, but they take the hits from any of his other moves rather well. Poliwrath, Whiscash, and Quagsire may be better off using Earthquake instead of Surf or Hydro Pump to counter Nidoking.</p> <p>Solrock and Lunatone should beware of Megahorn or Shadow Ball, and Grounds like Sandslash and Gligar cannot take Ice Beam, but if these moves are not present they are great counters.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {"description": "<p>The best UU set for Nidoking. One of the greatest threats to Nidoking is Gligar, and Ice Beam takes care of him. Shadow Ball takes care of Misdreavus, Megahorn beats Grass and Psychic Pokemon, and Earthquake gets STAB. The absence of Thunderbolt allows for a better EV distribution; Water Pokemon for the most part will take more damage from STAB Earthquake than non-STAB Thunderbolt. Give this one max Speed--it's essential for taking on Gligar that want to switch in on your Earthquake.</p>"},

As with a lot of Choice Banders, depending on your and your opponent's prediction skills you could be totally messing something up or doing nothing to them at all. Earthquake should take care of Quagsire and other Water friends in 2 or 3 hits, Megahorn kills Solrock and Lunatone and puts quite a big hurting into Meganium, and Rock Slide is for Fliers like Fearow and Scyther. Sludge Bomb may seem handy for STAB, and Ice Beam catches Gligar.</p>"}

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable is really unpredictable and that's where its strength lies. There are zero safe counters for him. However, once its set is found out, its average stats across the board will cause difficulties in damaging things effectively. All sets are quite viable for UU play.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast as a more powerful option over Flamethrower. Psychic is for Fighting-types. Reflect is a great move to support your team with and can work in tandem with Counter. Safeguard supports, too, but to a lesser extent. Sing can catch any Clefable counter with a quick Sleep, and can help you set up Calm Mind or Belly Drum. Snatch can get you a Substitute, Calm Mind, Recover, Soft-Boiled, Aromatherapy or Dragon Dance, as long as you're good at predicting. It's a novelty move though. Wish can be considered an option over Soft-Boiled most of the time, Clefable is an above average Wisher. It might be wise to use Protect with it, which can also check what a Choice Bander is going to do, it can help your Leftovers recovery and it saves you from Explosion.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Depends completely on the set, and there's still no strict way of doing them. Using the Magic Stat Numbers article gives you an idea what you can use for EVs on Clefable. Stick with what's given on the sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Countering Clefable safely is hard; you'll usually have to use a combination of Pokemon. Any Pokemon with Rest stalls out the Toxic staller. Steel and Poison-types work as well, though Weezing and the Steels should beware of Fire moves.</p> <p>Generally, powerful offense, Toxic, and Leech Seed stop Clefable. It often has to use Soft-Boiled, so use that to switch in a counter easily.</p> <p>Quagsire does about as well as Swampert and counters it under the same conditions. Hypno can Toxic or Thunder Wave Clefable and wall it, though Choice Band Clefable or generally Shadow Baller can hurt, and Hypno doesn't enjoy Toxic itself. Some offense from Aggron or Fearow can hurt Clefable a lot, but beware of Counter.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Belly Drum": {"description": "<p>Belly Drumming Clefable is quite fun, but not too good since after a Belly Drum its Attack is only 1048. Clefable is also quite slow which makes it hard to take advantage of its super high Attack, so make sure to paralyze some sweepers beforehand, or do it yourself with Thunder Wave. Even if you aren't able to find an opportunity to use Belly Drum, you can still get some random Attack boosts by using Meteor Mash if you picked that. Cosmic Power is an option as well to make this set more tankish: basically you Cosmic Power until you're not taking much damage from the opponent, use Soft-Boiled to recover the damage, Belly Drum up, and start hitting things. If you come across a Ghost or something that can kill you in the long run, Soft-Boiled to full HP, then switch out to come back later and try again.</p>"},
      "Calm Mind + BoltBeam": {"description": "<p>Standard Calm Mind Clefable, Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are only resisted by Magneton, Lanturn, and Shedinja. It doesn't do much against good Special sponges either. This Clefable's greatest enemy is Toxic. You can Rest it off, but expect to get hit hard physically then by Fearow or Aggron, for example. You can toy around with the EVs: more Special Defense means Calm Mind will make your Special Defense absolutely impregnable by Manectric or other Special Attackers, more Defense means you will get great defenses on both sides, and more Special Attack means you will have more firepower.</p>"},
      "Counter": {"description": "<p>Counter is one of Clefable's coolest moves. Pokemon that can be surprised by Counter include Fearow, Tauros, Quagsire, and many more. Clefable survives all of these. The first two moveslots can be about anything: Ice Beam + Thunderbolt is a good idea as well, and Calm Mind works to lure even more physical attacks; if you use Calm Mind, make sure to use a Special Attack in the other free moveslot. You can also use Light Screen in a similar way. Preferably don't use Thunder Wave here: if you Counter against a paralyzed Pokemon, you risk that they get fully paralyzed and your surprise will be given away.</p> <p>Make sure to switch to Bold and to shift Attack EVs to Special Attack when running Special Attacking moves.</p>"},
      "Cosmic Power Staller": {"description": "<p>A stalling set, takes a long time to win with. I don't like this set because you usually get forced to Rest and then phazed, and stalling for so long is just begging to eat a critical hit. I'd always go with Rest here, using Soft-Boiled makes you vulnerable to status. Use Encore on some attacking move and Seismic Toss them to death, or Toxic so your opponent loses HP even while you are setting up or recovering. Flamethrower / Fire Blast is a good option on this set to shut down Steel-types and Weezing.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>A more novel set. Please, use one of your many other Normal Choice Bander options. The only thing Clefable has over them is Meteor Mash, which isn't that great anyway. Feel free to blend in a special move like Flamethrower or Thunderbolt to hurt Skarmory. With these EVs you should be able to outpace Meganium, Blastoise, and about anything else with 200 Speed or lower.</p>"}

  "Vileplume": {
    "overview": "<p>A good UU Pokemon. It walls the hell out of Meganium (don't Sludge Bomb before you check for Counter though), can paralyze opponents or put them to sleep, supports with Aromatherapy and Leech Seed or sweeps with SunnyBeam. Like many other Grass- and Poison-types, however, it gets walled very easily, both in UU and in standard. Still, a good counter to Electric-, Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types, depending on EVs.</p> <p>Vileplume should only be used outside of UU with the Aromatherapy set, otherwise special versions are inferior to Exeggutor, and physical versions wish they could be Victreebel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stun Spore is cool if you can catch some fast Flier like Fearow or Salamence on the switch. Toxic is another status affliction Vileplume can deal out; it'll ruin Hypno, who relies on Wish to recover. It works wonders on Milotic and Suicune in standard too, the former losing stall potential, the latter being forced to Rest. Hidden Power Ghost is an alternative physical attack for Swords Dancing Vileplume.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>On the Sunny Day set, since it should only be used in UU, you don't need to worry about being faster than threats like Aerodactyl and Jolteon, so you have a few options here. You can opt to be faster than Electrode (which rarely, if ever, uses a +Speed nature, and it's already rare to begin with), which requires a stat of 190 before Sunny Day (giving 380 after), or 216 EVs. The next breakpoint would be +Speed Persian and Sneasel (also rare) which needs 180 EVs to get a stat of 181. The slowest you should go would be 136 Speed EVs, giving a stat of 170, as this is faster than Timid Manectric and Electabuzz after Sunny Day. Whatever you decide, max out Special Attack with Modest, and put the rest into HP or a defense.</p> <p>On the sweeping sets, you should max the attacking stat you're using, as suggested. The last set should always have max HP, and be mostly focused on one of the defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In standard, without Hidden Power Fire, Metagross, Forretress, Skarmory and other Steels laugh at Vileplume, except if they get Sleep Powdered. Heracross doesn't take much from anything Vileplume does, even Hidden Power Fire. Guts makes it ideal to absorb Stun Spore, and if it has Sleep Talk, then Sleep Powder as well. Dodrio, Salamence, Gyarados and other Fliers hit Vileplume hard with STAB Flying moves, but do not enjoy Stun Spore (due to the speed loss) or Sludge Bomb (because of poison chance and damage). Hidden Power Ice surprises some Fliers pretty well, too.</p> <p>In UU, Muk walls anything Vileplume throws at it, even the Sunnybeam set doesn't do much damage, and if Muk has Fire Blast Vileplume will be dead in two hits. Fearow hates Stun Spore, Hidden Power Ice and Sludge Bomb, but can come in on a Grass move easily and use Choice Banded Drill Peck, which OHKOs Vileplume. Sets without Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Ice / Fire will get walled by Jumpluff and other Grassers, while any set without a Grass attack has some trouble with Waters with Ice Beam as well as Ground-types. Without Hidden Power Fire, Vileplume is a sitting duck against any Steel.</p>",

Start disabling your counters by wearing them down with Hidden Power or putting one of them to Sleep with Sleep Powder. You will likely want to wait with using Sunny Day when you can OHKO most things your opponent has left, or if you can beat them one on one without dying the process. When the time is right, use Sunny Day to double speed, power up Hidden Power Fire and turn Solar Beam into a one-turn attack. Hidden Power Fire gets rid of Steels like Metagross and Skarmory in two shots, Salamence will nearly always die to one Hidden Power Ice. In UU play, Solar Beam already puts a big dent in Gligar (the only thing really worth using Hidden Power Ice for), so you'll probably want to use Hidden Power Fire for other Grassers like Meganium.</p> <p>Paralysis negates your speed boost, making sweeping practically impossible, so that's why Lum Berry is an option.

In addition, Vileplume is slow and its Attack is only average.</p> <p>Either way, the idea is to find some place to Swords Dance--preferably against a Water or a fellow Grasser-and then attack away, using Moonlight when needed. You can try to put one counter to Sleep with Sleep Powder. Moonlight is replaceable for another attacking move. Hidden Power Fighting has a chance to OHKO Aggron after a Swords Dance, Hidden Power Ground helps for Metagross and still puts a dent in Tyranitar if you're using this in OU.

Suicune might have some troubles once Poliwrath is set up, especially if Suicune lacks Roar. Suicune can't Surf it, and Ice Beam won't do much to it.

It does have some troubles with Salamence, and what can be more surprising than Ice Beaming it to oblivion.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Focus on Attack, with a bit of Speed (near max for Belly Drummers, a small amount for others), and drop the rest in HP or one of the defenses.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Claydol will just take it down, as long as it has Hidden Power Rock instead of Hidden Power Ghost. Note: Jolteon, Aerodactyl, and Crobat will still be faster than Poliwrath after the Salac boost, 1 stat point faster to be precise, if you max out Speed. As such, they will be labeled as counters. Venusaur, Donphan, Skarmory to an extent, Slowbro, Weezing, Gyarados, Flying types, Metagross, Salamence, Celebi, and Dragonite hit Poliwrath hard, in any set. As in UU, without Hydro Pump, Gligar can take any abuse it gives it and finish it off. If it's running without Substitute + Salac, faster things will just dominate it such as Fearow and Electabuzz.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Now this looks like an ordinary Substitute + Belly Drum Water version of Charizard, but it is in some ways better. Send this on a Water Pokemon, especially if your opponent's Suicune doesn't have Roar. The scenario might go like this: You Substitute, they switch. You Belly Drum, they attack. You get Salac boost and you can just attack. Hidden Power Ghost hits Ghosts and Psychics super effectively, but Hidden Power Rock gets Fliers. Since Poliwrath can't get over 394 Speed (393 max with Salac), the EVs suggested give just enough to beat Jolly Dugtrio and Timid Alakazam, as well as take less than 25% from Salamence's Choice Band Rock Slide (so you can switch it in after it kills something, Substitute as it attacks for less than 1/4 or switches, and then Belly Drum). With Hidden Power Rock, you'll need to increase your Speed EVs by 4 at the cost of Defense.</p> <p>In UU, barring Jolly Persian and Electrode, Adamant Poliwrath with those EVs is faster than all UU Pokemon after its Salac activates, giving you some much needed hitting power.</p> <p>Return hits Poisons and, most importantly, Gligar much harder than Brick Break or your Hidden Powers, hits Fliers harder than Hidden Power Ghost, and hits Psychics harder than Hidden Power Rock. It will always OHKO Gligar, but even min HP Gligar has a chance to survive Adamant Hidden Power. You can't even touch Ghosts, obviously, but in UU, Gligar, Vileplume, and Hypno are all common, and Return is the only way to cover them all. Don't use Hidden Power Rock in UU, as there are few Fliers that don't either take neutral damage from Fighting (Fearow and company), or take neutral damage from Rock (Gligar).</p>"

Hypnosis helps you to set up more easily and may shut down your main counter, while Bulk Up makes Poliwrath a physical tank. If you can set up a Substitute against slower physical Pokemon and Bulk Up a few times, they're going to be in a world of pain.</p> <p>Using Ice Beam on this set isn't a bad idea.

Ice Beam is to 2HKO Salamence, who is probably going to be their first switch in to Poliwrath. Focus Punch is easy to get off against Roar Suicune, and also good against Milotic. Sleep Talk is an option to make this thing a real Milotic counter, and it can go over anything but Brick Break.</p>"}

  "Victreebel": {
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Victreebel is usually not worth using in UU due to it being outclassed by Vileplume, which is far bulkier and thus leverages its typing better defensively. However, Victreebel is more functional as a Swords Dance user due to its higher Attack and Speed, making it potentially threatening if faster checks can be removed; it even has a small edge over Tentacruel in this role thanks to Sleep Powder, although its middling Speed and poor coverage make it relatively easy to stop regardless. Sludge Bomb's damage output is quite good even against neutral targets, especially after a boost; at +2 it notably OHKOes common threats like Ampharos, Lanturn, specially defensive Vileplume, and offensive Kangaskhan after Spikes damage. Sludge Bomb's poison chance also lets it exert pressure even on reliable switch-ins like Scyther and Arcanine. Hidden Power Ground provides crucial coverage for Rock-, Steel-, and opposing Poison-types such as Omastar, Aggron, and Tentacruel, although it leaves Victreebel walled by Gligar as well as common Levitate users such as Misdreavus and Solrock. Sleep Powder is the preferred fourth move, being an extremely valuable tool for creating setup opportunities and disrupting the opponent's defensive core, and it has little opportunity cost since Victreebel has no useful coverage options beyond Hidden Power. However, if you don't enjoy the risk of missing Sleep Powder, Encore is similarly helpful for locking slower foes into unfavorable moves such as Toxic. Synthesis is another usable option to enhance Victreebel's longevity, but its frailty limits the move's effectivenenss.</p> <p>Good teammates for Victreebel generally fall into two categories: supportive Pokemon that can help it sweep or handle its checks, and other offensive Pokemon that can take advantage of Sleep Powder. Omastar is a great example of the former, switching into threatening Normal- and Flying-type attacks for it from the likes of Kangaskhan, Granbull, and Scyther, and setting up the Spikes that are necessary to make lasting progress against common checks like Arcanine and bulky Water-types. Solrock has a similarly useful defensive profile while also checking Gligar and pivoting around Psychic-type attacks for Victreebel. Having a plan for faster checks like Scyther, Arcanine, and Haunter is also important, with this usually being done via paralysis support from a lure like Body Slam Kangaskhan or, on hyper offense teams, with an even faster threat like Electrode, one's own Scyther, or Rain Dance Gorebyss. On the topic of Gorebyss, any frail sweeper that appreciates a free turn of setup will enjoy Victreebel's Sleep Powder; this can also include Rain Dance Omastar as well as Swords Dance Scyther, Calm Mind Grumpig, and Dragon Dance Pupitar among others.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>A good Pokemon to use in the UU metagame as it stops many sweepers and Choice Band users cold in their tracks. It also has Explosion, which can help to eliminate a Pokemon that's causing you trouble and generally gives some shock value. Golem's weaknesses to Earthquake and special attacks are a huge scar, though.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Block you can trap something on the switch, but the chance that Golem will be beating whatever switches in on him is slim. Its prime use is trapping Quagsire or some other slower Pokemon and then Exploding on it, but beware Damp or Protect Quagsire. Toxic can be used to wear things like Meganium and Solrock down, but won't work if your opponent has Aromatherapy or Heal Bell. Counter is a great surprise: Golem can survive many Earthquakes and Fighting hits to bounce them back for a quick KO. Roar is useful for Baton Pass chains.</p> <p>Golem can use Body Slam to paralyze a few of its counters, and can follow up with Rock Slide to lock them into paralysis and flinch until they faint. Focus Punch can hit some things hard on the switch, but it has the same power as Earthquake after STAB, so that won't generally do much for you.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Just put a load in HP and Attack, and a little in Defense. Defensive Golem should use Impish, while Choice Banders can use Impish or Adamant. A little Speed can be welcome to Explode on slow stuff, though. 72 EVs is enough for most Vileplume. Trying to outspeed Solrock or Walrein isn't worth the investment.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golem has trouble with Solrock. Levitate grants it immunity to Earthquake, and with stacked HP and Defense and a faster Reflect, it is not easy to get past. Lunatone has less Defense, but the same typing and ability as well as that super effective Ice Beam to watch out for. Grasses generally make Golem shiver with fear, especially those who have Earthquake resistance, like Meganium and Bellossom. Vileplume and Victreebel OHKO him with any Grass move as well, but they don't like eating repeated STAB Earthquakes. Waters are a problem as well as that's Golem's secondary 4x weakness. Blastoise, Politoed and Poliwrath can all take a beating and Surf or Hydro Pump away. Walrein is weak to Rock, but if it can get in on another move, Golem is still toast. Quagsire has the advantage of the Rock resistance, and can also use STAB Earthquake or Surf, or Ice Beam. Misdreavus is immune to Double-Edge, Explosion, and Earthquake which is a great hindrance, especially for Choice Banders.</p> <p>Besides all this, any kind of decently powered special attack will really mess up Golem, if it doesn't end up KOing him. Not all special attackers like to come into Golem Earthquakes or Rock Slides though.</p>",

This is the Pokemon that makes Baton Passing such a dangerous strategy, since it stops Pokemon with Roar.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Razor Leaf is a shafted move in ADV, but a critical hit can mess up things. Grass Whistle is a poor man's Sleep Powder, and again it could hit once. Meganium is very durable and won't mind the accuracy drop as much as fragile Sleepers like Persian would. Toxic is nothing new as an alternative and can work well on something as bulky as Meganium.Substitute + Leech Seed is an interesting combination that should always be mentioned, but Meganium is really too slow to abuse it.</p> <p>Swords Dance can power up physical moves, but you're probably better off using Victreebel for the STAB on Sludge Bomb. Giving Meganium Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice will allow you to cover more Pokemon types. Finally, if you are paranoid about being statused, Rest over Synthesis is an option. Don't try Sunny Day or Solar Beam, though; use Vileplume or Exeggutor for that.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you plan to use Reflect, you'll want to get more Special Defense than suggested above. Alternately, you can use more Special Attack to help a bit with Walrein switches.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>You'll want to watch out for all Grasses, especially those that carry Toxic or are named Vileplume. Fire-types pretty much prove an end to Meganium. Muk and other Poisons in general will have an easy time switching in and have STAB Sludge Bomb to hit Meganium hard. Tentacruel can turn Leech Seed against you with Liquid Ooze, and set up a Swords Dance sweep, or just straight up Sludge Bomb you.</p>",
    "sets": {"Standard": {"description": "<p>Counter is great on Meganium, 100 base in both defenses works excellently.

It is definitely unexpected, and that Special Attack isn't awful, and it's got a fair few special attacks there (Crunch and Dragon Claw too), so it's always up for consideration. Brick Break is there, of course, and if you don't like Swords Dance, you can go for a choice band set if you really want. Counter is somewhat unexpected on this Pokemon, so it's a possible choice. Screech at the very least forces a switch, or else let you totally destroy your foe.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For the first moveset you will want to max out that Attack, put a fair few into Speed, and dump the rest into HP. Its defenses are pretty good for the most part anyway. And maybe some into Special Attack to back Hydro Pump up a bit. Go Adamant or Brave. For the second one you'll want to split your EVs like you would for Gengar and Swampert.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>This big brute will survive weaker Electric and Grass attacks, but I wouldn't push your luck.

  "Ampharos": {
    "overview": "<p>Ampharos makes a name for itself as the best cleric and Electric-type in ADV UU. In a metagame where teams are filled with multiple Pokemon using Toxic or spreading paralysis, Heal Bell is one of the most valuable utility tools for sustaining both offensive and defensive Pokemon, and Ampharos is very effective at using it. Ampharos is a common switch-in to the tier's plethora of Water- and Electric-types by virtue of having impressive mixed bulk coupled with a great ability in Static, which is good at punishing weak contact moves like Rapid Spin, Thief, and Scyther's Aerial Ace. Ampharos isn't a completely passive wall, however, as it is blessed with an astounding base 115 Special Attack stat, which is tied for the highest in the tier with Omastar. This means that it doesn't need much investment to match the power of other Electric-types. Ampharos is a staple on a wide variety of teams that need its cleric support, from balance to bulky offense, working on both Toxic spam and paralysis spam archetypes.</p> <p>However, what can hinder Ampharos as a wall is its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers. This, in conjunction with its poor base Speed, means it has trouble switching in repeatedly when Spikes are up. While Heal Bell is a good support option, its low 8 PP is also a problem for Ampharos, meaning it has to use its opportunities to use Heal Bell wisely, lest it gets overwhelmed by foes repeatedly statusing it. Many Pokemon can also use Heal Bell as an entry point, including powerful wallbreakers such as offensive Kangaskhan and Choice Band Solrock. The tier's common physical attackers usually run Ground-type moves, which Ampharos doesn't like taking due to its lower physical bulk, and even Water-types like Blastoise and Walrein can use Earthquake to keep Ampharos from repeatedly switching in. Finally, while Ampharos deals decent neutral damage, it can fall short of breaking past specially bulky targets like Kangaskhan and Cradily, often relying only on Toxic and Spikes pressure to make progress against them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Focus Punch can be used over a status move with a Quiet nature to break past Kangaskhan, but it reduces Ampharos's ability to make progress using status, and it isn't guaranteed to 2HKO Kangaskhan with Defense investment. Protect can be used instead of a status move for Ampharos to gain more Leftovers recovery, scout Choice Band users such as Solrock, and guard itself against Explosion from Pokemon like Qwilfish and Electrode. Rest can be used with a secondary cleric to give Ampharos recovery and preserve Heal Bell PP for itself. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative Hidden Power choice to be able to deal meaningful damage on Lanturn without resorting to Toxic, and it hits Golem and Quagsire 4x super effectively. However, Hidden Power Ice is preferred for more common checks to Ampharos. Counter can be used to get a surprise KO on some physical attackers that threaten Ampharos, but it has higher risk than reward compared to other consistent options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan walls Ampharos with great special bulk and Early Bird Rest to nullify status. Kangaskhan's Speed also means it will get the jump on Ampharos to pressure with a Normal-type STAB move or to recover off damage it takes from Thunderbolt with Spikes up. Even if Kangaskhan isn't going the bulky route, its offensive sets are able to severely dent Ampharos while avoiding Static when using Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types can find entry on Thunderbolt and proceed to scare out Ampharos. Nidoqueen is a bulky wallbreaker with a Toxic immunity that can use its entry to pressure Ampharos's team with strong coverage and Sludge Bomb poisons, which puts the onus on Ampharos to come back in to use Heal Bell to clear the poison, circling back around to giving Nidoqueen entry again. Quagsire and Camerupt's unique typings allow them to not be affected by BoltBeam coverage, which lets them stonewall Ampharos and apply pressure to its team. Other Ground-types such as Gligar, Golem, Sandslash, and Nidoking can find entry, but they take more damage from Hidden Power Ice and have to be more careful when switching in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types are able to come in and wall Ampharos, with their weakness to Hidden Power Ice being offset with bulk and instant recovery. Cradily is a prime Ampharos check despite its vulnerability to Toxic. It has great special bulk that lets it shrug off Hidden Power Ice, packs super effective coverage in Earthquake to punish passive plays like Toxic and Heal Bell and threaten a 3HKO, and has Recover with 32 PP, which means unlike other Grass-types that rely on Synthesis or Moonlight, its recovery option can be used liberally over the course of a game. Vileplume is immune to Toxic while having Leech Seed and Moonlight to outlast Ampharos with recovery, and it makes progress through Sludge Bomb poisons or even setting up Swords Dance. Roselia and Cacturne enter on Ampharos to set up Spikes, with Roselia preventing Ampharos from making progress due to its Toxic immunity and Synthesis and Cacturne exerting pressure with Encore and Counter.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos is able to check itself due to its huge bulk, and it can force opposing Ampharos to burn Heal Bell PP by repeatedly using status moves. Lanturn can find entry on Ampharos with Volt Absorb healing off any prior damage it takes, meaning it can stonewall Ampharos due to its BoltBeam resistance. Lanturn can protect itself against status from Ampharos by using Substitute or Rest, and can pressure it by battering it down with Surf or forcing it to burn Heal Bell PP by using Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Muk</strong>: Muk's enormous special bulk, coupled with a Toxic immunity, allows it to come in on Ampharos and break open holes in Ampharos's team, or even pose a threat to sweep with Curse + Rest.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cleric": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Ampharos is a team's primary user of Heal Bell, which allows it to absorb status and cure its teammates of their own status, increasing the longevity of bulkier teammates or keeping offensive threats healthy, both of which include itself. Hidden Power Ice is used to hit Grass- and Ground-types such as Vileplume, Cradily, and Gligar. Most Ground-types besides Nidoqueen are 2HKOed by it, while Gligar is OHKOed, making their entry risky if Ampharos makes correct predictions. Toxic lets Ampharos make progress against defensive cores and cripple its checks that aren't immune to Toxic such as Kangaskhan, Lanturn, Cradily, Hypno, and opposing Ampharos. Thunder Wave is an alternative status option to hinder the Speed of Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Arcanine on paralysis spam structures.</p> <p>Maximum HP and 88 Defense EVs let Ampharos avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Scyther's Hidden Power Bug, and 120 Special Defense EVs prevent a 3HKO from Lapras's Ice Beam. 16 Speed EVs are also used to outspeed certain defensive Omastar spreads.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ampharos pairs well with nearly every Pokemon in the tier, but it especially appreciates teammates that can help sustain its longevity or pose an offensive threat. Kangaskhan provides Ampharos Wish support, spreads status through Toxic or Body Slam, and absorbs status from Ampharos's checks to maintain Heal Bell PP. Omastar checks most physical attackers that can threaten Ampharos, and it provides Spikes support that helps Ampharos threaten its checks upon switching in, since most of them aren't Spikes immune. If a Rapid Spin user tries to remove Omastar's Spikes, Ampharos can find entry and punish their attempt at spinning with Static. Omastar can also reliably run Rest with cleric support, keeping it healthy to check physical attackers long-term. Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop is appreciated for Ampharos to comfortably switch into the things it checks. Vileplume partners well with Ampharos, as its bulk and multitude of recovery options allow it to check Kangaskhan and opposing Ampharos, and it provides extra status support through Sludge Bomb poisons or Stun Spore. Pokemon that pose sweeping threats help Ampharos's team establish a long-term offensive threat to mitigate some of Ampharos's own passivity. Long-term win conditions with Rest such as Slowking, Xatu, and Curse users like Walrein, Lapras, and Muk are great in this role, as they are at their most threatening when backed by cleric support to reduce the number of turns they are asleep. Ampharos is one of the best leads in the tier, as it checks common leads such as Qwilfish, Granbull, and Walrein, and it can stalemate with other Electric-type leads like Ampharos and Electabuzz. However, it can also be useful outside of the lead position to preserve its health until it needs to switch in against Water- and Electric-types.</p>"

  "Granbull": {
    "overview": "<p>Granbull is one of ADV UU's best physical wallbreakers and physical walls, serving as one of the tier's best checks to Kangaskhan. Its good physical bulk, combined with Intimidate and the fact that it is only weak to Focus Punch, means it is very reliable at switching into Kangaskhan and pressuring it on the physical side. These qualities also allow it to check many other physical attackers such as Scyther, Solrock, Nidoqueen, and opposing Granbull. Granbull can also pose a potential sweeping threat if it runs Bulk Up, turning many physical attackers into setup fodder and hitting very hard in return, or it can have devastating power when holding a Choice Band.</p> <p>Although Granbull takes hits well on the physical side, its lower Special Defense means it often loses interactions against common special attackers such as Arcanine, Ampharos, and Walrein. Granbull is also very slow to where even defensive Pokemon such as Omastar and Ampharos are able to move before Granbull can respond, limiting its offensive pressure and hurting its ability to switch in, especially when Spikes are up. Granbull's Normal typing means it lacks key resistances that other physical walls such as Omastar and Hitmontop have, meaning if it hasn't used Intimidate on a physical attacker, it can't fall back on its typing to check the opposing threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Granbull can run SubPunch to ease prediction on its switch-ins, being a great lure to Cradily, as its Substitute isn't broken by Cradily's hits. However, Granbull usually ends up being too slow to use Substitute to effectively block status moves, and it often isn't specially bulky enough for its Substitute to survive weaker hits from Misdreavus and Blastoise. This leaves it less effective than SubPunch Kangaskhan, which is faster, specially bulkier, and can put up 101 HP Substitutes to live a Seismic Toss from Hypno, Clefable, or Sableye. Granbull can be purely defensive support by running Body Slam + Heal Bell + RestTalk, which provides cleric support while maintaining the recovery of Rest to preserve Heal Bell PP. However, this set is flawed by its overall passivity and reliance on PP stalling to check physical attackers, a tall task with the set's meager PP. Despite RestTalk keeping Granbull active while asleep, Granbull can't burn sleep turns if it switches after using Sleep Talk, and it can't rely on a cleric to cure its sleep, since Granbull itself is acting as the cleric. Thunder Wave can be used on utility sets to consistently paralyze opponents without using Body Slam, allowing Granbull to run a stronger STAB option. On Bulk Up sets, Granbull can run Chesto Berry with Rest to instantly heal itself without having to stay asleep, but Leftovers is the preferred item, as the passive recovery is more valuable and consistent. Granbull can run Thief with no item to remove Leftovers from bulky Pokemon and capitalize on the switches it forces, but despite that, it competes with other moveslots in Granbull's typical sets that can be more useful on a game-to-game basis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Omastar</strong>: Omastar's massive Defense and Normal resistance allows it to comfortably take hits from Granbull while not being too bothered by its coverage options. It can use its entry to set Spikes for the benefit of its team and hurt Granbull's ability to switch in or pressure Granbull with a strong Surf. However, Omastar is susceptible to Body Slam paralysis when switching in, and Granbull can punish Omastar switching in or using Spikes with Earthquake or Focus Punch.</p> <p><strong>Cradily</strong>: Cradily is a Rock-type that isn't weak to Granbull's Earthquake. It can use Recover to instantly heal any damage Granbull deals, outlasting it long-term, and Toxic to place Granbull on a turn limit and force it to use Rest, which grants entry for one of Cradily's offensive teammates. However, Cradily doesn't deal any meaningful damage to Granbull outside of Toxic, which allows Granbull to find opportunities to use Focus Punch as it switches in or tries to use Recover, or sweep with Bulk Up to take advantage of its general passivity. Choice Band Granbull also has enough significant power to muscle through Cradily with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon are physical attackers that can threaten Granbull with super effective damage. Hitmontop can use its good physical bulk and Intimidate to switch into Granbull and threaten it with Brick Break or clear Spikes with Rapid Spin. However, Hitmontop's lack of recovery means it can struggle to switch into Granbull repeatedly without Wish support, and it really struggles to switch into Choice Band Granbull, as it takes up to 70% from Double-Edge. Hitmontop's lack of power also means it can struggle to break past Bulk Up Granbull unless it uses Bulk Up itself. Hitmonlee is better at threatening Granbull thanks to its higher Attack stat and Choice Band, but it can't switch into Granbull without heavy prediction on a Rest or Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: With their immunity to Normal-type moves, Ghost-types can act as reliable pivots into Granbull and even wall it if Granbull lacks Shadow Ball. Misdreavus and Haunter are also immune to Ground, with Haunter being the best check into non-Shadow Ball Granbull, as it can use Will-O-Wisp to passively damage Granbull and Taunt to prevent Granbull from using Rest or Heal Bell. Even with Shadow Ball, Will-O-Wisp can hurt Granbull's general wallbreaking power, and Haunter can use Destiny Bond to remove Granbull for the benefit of one of its teammates. Sableye lacks the weakness to Shadow Ball that the aforementioned Ghost-types do and can win long-term versus Granbull by virtue of Recover to outlast Granbull and tools like Toxic and Knock Off to hurt Granbull's longevity. Sableye tanks hits well from typical Granbull sets, but Bulk Up or Choice Band variants are able to muscle past it and take advantage of Sableye's lack of immediate pressure.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: While other bulky Water-types besides Omastar don't resist Granbull's attacks, some of them, such as Walrein, Blastoise, and Lapras, are typically resilient at taking its hits in situations where they need to apply pressure and win the interaction. Walrein is the best at doing both, with great physical bulk that lives three Returns and a strong Ice Beam that has odds to 2HKO Granbull. Blastoise has to rely on a 3HKO with Surf but takes hits just as well as Walrein, and Lapras is slightly worse at taking Granbull's hits but consistently 2HKOes it with Hydro Pump. All of them don't appreciate switching into Granbull, though, as they fear the risk of Body Slam paralysis or a powerful Focus Punch for Walrein and Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Granbull</strong>: Opposing Granbull is able to switch into Granbull and trade hits, only fearing a potential Focus Punch, and it can use Granbull as setup fodder if it's running Bulk Up. However, it has to be careful switching into Choice Band Granbull with Spikes up, and the opposing Granbull can use Bulk Up to set up on it and counteract Intimidate, potentially forcing stalemates if both have Bulk Up.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Granbull has good utility as an offensive wallbreaker with Intimidate to check opposing physical attackers and Heal Bell to act as a cleric, two notable advantages over offensive Kangaskhan. Return chunks any target that doesn't resist it and is generally a safe move to use, but if the additional damage isn't needed, Granbull can instead run Body Slam to spread paralysis for itself and its team, pressuring Kangaskhan into using Rest early and even pressuring switch-ins such as Omastar and Hitmontop. Focus Punch deals massive damage to Kangaskhan to prevent any attempts at Rest stalling it, and it can hit Granbull checks such as Omastar, Cradily, and opposing Granbull trying to switch in. It also punishes them for playing passively when using Spikes, Recover, or Toxic, respectively. Earthquake requires less prediction while hitting some of the same targets and deals more damage to Poison- and Electric-types such as Tentacruel, Nidoqueen, and Ampharos. Shadow Ball is used to give Granbull a reliable way to hit Solrock while also hitting Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter. Heal Bell allows Granbull to absorb status from Kangaskhan and Solrock and cure its teammates of status, helping its longevity and enabling other offensive and defensive threats. Rest, however, gives Granbull long-term recovery and a reliable way to counteract Spikes damage that would otherwise hinder Granbull's ability to consistently switch in.</p> <p>40 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used to 3HKO 252 HP / 112 Def Kangaskhan with Return, and the rest of the EVs are put into HP and Defense to help Granbull switch into physical attackers reliably. If Granbull is running Body Slam, 96 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature allow it to 3HKO maximum HP Kangaskhan and deal more damage with its coverage options. Speed investment can be used if Granbull can sacrifice its defensive EVs. 44 Speed EVs allow Granbull to outspeed minimum Speed Vileplume, and 84 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed minimum Speed Omastar and Ampharos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Granbull is good at switching into physical attackers, it still appreciates help preserving its health to check them over the longer course of a game. Kangaskhan provides an excellent defensive synergy by checking special threats that Granbull doesn't comfortably take hits well from, such as Arcanine, Lapras, Walrein, and Ampharos, while also providing valuable Wish support to keep Granbull healthy. Spikes impede Granbull's ability to switch in, so it appreciates Rapid Spin support from Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop, proving especially helpful against teams with Spikes, as Granbull tends to draw in Omastar. Ampharos, Vileplume, Lapras, and Altaria all provide cleric support in case Granbull is using Rest, as it doesn't like the downtime it has while it is burning sleep turns, which can be troublesome against setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther and Gligar. Granbull also appreciates its own Spikes support, as it likes the extra push of damage on bulky targets, and most of its common switch-ins take Spikes damage. Omastar is a good Spikes setter with Granbull, sharing some of the defensive duties by switching into Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Solrock to set Spikes. Qwilfish and Glalie are also Spikes setters that can threaten physical walls like Omastar with Hidden Power Grass and opposing Granbull, Hitmontop, Walrein, Vileplume, and Blastoise with Explosion, reducing the opposing team's ability to take on Granbull significantly. Since Granbull is slow and can't seal a late-game win by itself, it appreciates fast late-game cleaners that appreciate bulky Pokemon being weakened, such as Scyther, Gligar, and Electabuzz.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With Bulk Up, Granbull can turn into a dangerous setup sweeper that uses Intimidate against physical attackers to create opportunities to boost and threaten to 2HKO the entire metagame. Return has good unboosted damage on physically bulky targets such as Kangaskhan, Blastoise, and Walrein and is a safe move to throw out if Granbull doesn't want to commit to a sweep. Body Slam helps spread paralysis for Granbull and its teammates, making it scarier when having to take boosted hits from it, but it fails to reach certain damage thresholds that Return has, making Granbull need more boosts to threaten neutral targets. Earthquake allows Granbull to hit Rock-types such as Omastar and Golem while also avoiding contact abilities such as Static and Poison Point. With enough boosts, Earthquake is also able to provide a meaningful neutral hit into Cradily, which has trouble combating boosted Granbull. Shadow Ball hits Solrock and Ghost-types such as Haunter and Misdreavus, and its perfect coverage is enough to threaten the whole tier. Rest can be used instead of Shadow Ball to give Granbull a means of long-term recovery. However, dropping Shadow Ball makes it prone to being completely walled by Haunter and Misdreavus. Heal Bell can also be run to cure Granbull's own status while also functioning as solid team support, but it doesn't restore Granbull's health, unlike Rest, and it doesn't give Granbull much room to set up due to taking on more of a cleric role.</p> <p>40 Attack EVs are used to 3HKO 252 HP / 112 Def Kangaskhan with unboosted Return and 2HKO it at +1, while the rest are put into HP and Defense to help Granbull switch into physical attackers. If Granbull is running Body Slam, 96 Attack EVs allow it to 3HKO maximum HP Kangaskhan while also making its Attack boosts from Bulk Up more significant. Speed investment can be used by sacrificing Granbull's Defense; 44 Speed EVs allow Granbull to outspeed minimum Speed Vileplume, and 84 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed minimum Speed Omastar and Ampharos.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulk Up Granbull fits on different teams depending on what last move it's running, often needing different kinds of support between its offensive and defensive synergies. If Granbull is running Shadow Ball, it tends to be used as a more short-term setup sweeper that provides extra insurance into physical threats, allowing it to fit on more aggressive teams like hyper offense nicely. Shadow Ball Granbull especially appreciates Spikes to break through bulky targets, making offensive Spikers such as Omastar, Qwilfish, and Glalie good teammates. Omastar provides a secondary backbone against physical attackers so that Granbull isn't overwhelmed when switching into them, and Qwilfish and Glalie can threaten physical walls with Explosion to weaken the opposing team and further enable Granbull's sweeping capabilities. Late-game cleaners as Scyther, Gligar, and Electrode, as well as Rain Dance sweepers like Omastar and Gorebyss, appreciate the progress Granbull can make wallbreaking early- to mid-game.</p> <p>If running Rest, Granbull tends to fit more on bulky balance teams that use it as a main source of offense tasked to deal with Kangaskhan and Scyther. Using Rest means that Granbull appreciates cleric support from Ampharos, Vileplume, Lapras, or Altaria to wake it up so it can sweep with Bulk Up at any stage in the game and keep its threat level high. Although Granbull can switch into physical threats to set up, this is made harder when it has to switch in with Spikes up, making Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop good partners. Wish support from Kangaskhan or Hypno is another way to improve Granbull's longevity and replenish its health for sweeping without making it as reliant on Rest. Bulky special attackers such as Arcanine, Walrein, and Lapras can stand in the way of Granbull's sweep by threatening powerful moves, so it appreciates special walls such as Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Lanturn to take on these threats. Swords Dance users are difficult to deal with when Granbull uses Rest, as they can boost past Bulk Up's defense boosts and Intimidate. Reversal Scyther in particular can take advantage of Granbull's Fighting-type weakness and threaten to countersweep. Thus, Pokemon with priority moves such as Scyther, Gligar, and Arcanine are good for stopping it. Granbull makes a good pairing with Slowking on bulky offense teams, as both fulfill a similar defensive sweeping role and can take on each other's checks. Slowking helps check Water-types and Arcanine, while Granbull helps check Choice Band Scyther and Kangakshan.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Granbull provides more immediate firepower and hits extremely hard, being very threatening to weakened or paralyzed teams. Since Body Slam's damage is buffed by Choice Band, it's the preferred STAB move over Return for its chance to paralyze Granbull's switch-ins and enable its wallbreaking potential, though Return can still be used if the extra damage is preferable for better OHKO potential against Scyther, Gligar, Arcanine, and Lanturn, as well as a consistent 2HKO on Blastoise. Double-Edge from Granbull is one of the hardest-hitting physical attacks in the tier outside of Explosion, doing the impressive feat of being able to OHKO a few bulky Kangaskhan variants while also being generally hard to switch into. Double-Edge should not be used as a move to lead with, though, as the recoil is a huge tax to Granbull's health and should be used once the opposing team is weakened and Granbull finds an opening such as Kangaskhan using Rest. Return acts similarly to Double-Edge as a very powerful hit without the recoil damage, making it safer yet less rewarding as a powerful STAB option. Granbull can also run Focus Punch over its weaker STAB moves as a way to punish Kangaskhan's Rest and potentially OHKO defensive Omastar, Cradily, and Golem switching in. Earthquake hits common Normal- resistant Pokemon such as Omastar and Golem while also avoiding contact abilities such as Static and Poison Point. Granbull can muscle past Cradily and Sableye with Earthquake thanks to the increased damage of Choice Band. Shadow Ball is used to hit Solrock and Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter while also 2HKOing Slowking.</p> <p>Maximum Attack with an Adamant nature allows Granbull to hit as hard as possible in conjunction with Choice Band, and 100 Speed EVs are used to outspeed defensive Omastar and Ampharos. Granbull can also run maximum Speed to be less reliant on paralysis support to outspeed Pokemon like Solrock, Hitmontop, Lapras, and Blastoise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because this Granbull set doesn't have good staying power with the lack of defensive EVs and no Leftovers, it shouldn't be used as a primary check to physical attackers. To remedy this, Granbull should be paired with a reliable physical wall such as Omastar, Golem, or Hitmontop, as they find safer opportunties for entry against Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Solrock. Because Granbull has lacking Speed as a Choice Band user, it appreciates heavy paralysis support to gain the first hit against faster foes, making good pairings with Body Slam Kangaskhan, Thunder Wave Ampharos, and Stun Spore Vileplume to land paralysis on fast Pokemon like Scyther, Gligar, and Arcanine. Spikes makes Choice Band Granbull much more difficult to switch into, so reliable Spikes setters such as Omastar, Qwilfish, Glalie, and Roselia are good partners to enable its dangerous power further. Qwilfish and Roselia in particular help spread paralysis for Granbull, and when paired with Thunder Wave Misdreavus to block opposing Rapid Spin and continue the paralysis support, Granbull makes for a great wallbreaker on Spikes paralysis teams. Since Choice Band Granbull lacks any recovery and can get worn down quickly by Spikes and Double-Edge recoil, Wish support from Kangaskhan and Hypno gives Granbull a means to regain its lost health and offset passive damage. Cleric support from Ampharos, Vileplume, Lapras, and Altaria is also appreciated, as this Granbull set is more weak to status due to the lack of recovery options. If Granbull locks itself into a Normal-type move for Omastar to find entry on, things can get problematic, as Spikes damage is permanent without Wish support and is further compounded when Granbull takes Double-Edge recoil. Therefore, it appreciates being paired with a Rapid Spin user such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, or Hitmontop to minimize the passive damage it takes.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It can Double Kick for stuff like Substitute Aggron, but it's not that useful. It can use Return to hit Gligar harder than any of your other moves.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Attack and Speed, only.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gligar is the best counter, thanks to its high Defense, Flying STAB, and Hitmonlee's low Defense. Slowking will also have a thing or two to say to it. Masquerain beats those without Rock Slide. Blastoise and Meganium can take hits from the Choice Band set. Grumpig and Hypno can use it to set up Calm Mind with their Fighting resistance, but Hidden Power Ghost will put the hurt on them.</p>",
    "sets": {"Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Use this Choice Band set how you would any other Choice Bander, with one important proviso: Hitmonlee can also switch into paralyzing moves such as Thunder Wave with impunity, since it has the Limber ability.

This is a pretty simple and standard strategy, but again Hitmonlee's Limber ability is extremely useful for this set.</p> <p>Bulk Up can be used with either Substitute or Endure, but Focus Punch should be used with Substitute. If you are using Bulk Up, you may want to lower your Speed to 254 Speed (176 EVs) and put the rest into HP so you can potentially get 2 or more Bulk Ups, as this still allows you to outspeed everything in UU but Timid Electrode, which is extremely rare.</p>"}}
  },
  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmontop is one of the tier's few Fighting-types, offering unique role compression by being able to both use Rapid Spin and check the tier's best Pokemon, Kangaskhan. Hitmontop's ability Intimidate isn't just useful for switching into Kangaskhan, however, as it checks a slew of other physical attackers such as Granbull, Nidoqueen, and Solrock, which Hitmontop counters. Its base 110 Special Defense is nothing to scoff at either, letting it take hits and trade with certain special attackers in a pinch such as Tentacruel, Ampharos, and Lanturn. Hitmontop's access to Fighting-type STAB lets it threaten many common Pokemon, and it has a good physical movepool for coverage to back it up.</p> <p>However, while Hitmontop can both check Kangaskhan and use Rapid Spin as dual role compression, it finds itself being less effective at both than the Pokemon it competes with, such as Granbull for the former and Tentacruel and Blastoise for the latter. Hitmontop's meager base 50 HP and lack of reliable recovery means it can have trouble switching in against offensive Kangaskhan variants with Spikes up. Without the Intimidate Attack drop, it also takes heavy damage from the physical attackers it means to check besides Solrock. Hitmontop's onus to use Rapid Spin can also make it passive against Spikes teams, and it tends to invite in dangerous Pokemon such as Scyther and Gligar. Not only this, but Hitmontop can struggle against teams using Misdreavus to spinblock, as Hitmontop does not like wasting its health to Psychic without getting a chance to use Rapid Spin. Hitmontop also has issues offensively; as a Fighting-type, it wants as much coverage as possible but can't fit everything into one set, giving it painful four-moveslot syndrome. Even with the proper coverage, Hitmontop's unimpressive base 95 Attack means it lacks power even against the Pokemon hit super effectively by it, such as Omastar, Walrein, and Cradily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mach Punch serves as a priority move to check sweepers such as Reversal Scyther, Rain Dance Omastar, and Petaya Berry Electric-types such as Electrode and Manectric. Thief can be used with no item to steal Leftovers from bulky Pokemon such as Ampharos, Tentacruel, and Vileplume. However, Hitmontop has to drop valuable coverage to run it, and it can backfire if Hitmontop accidentally steals a Choice Band from Scyther. Rest can be used alongside a cleric to gain recovery, but it makes Hitmontop much more passive while asleep, and it can't threaten with more coverage. Bulk Up can be used over a coverage option to pose a potential sweeping threat when it finds entry, and Hitmontop can use it to match the boosts of Curse users such as Walrein, Lapras, and Muk. High Jump Kick sounds appealing to threaten Kangaskhan and Omastar more than Brick Break can, but the extra damage is not worth it when considering its less than perfect accuracy and potential for massive recoil damage on a Pokemon that already struggles to preserve its health. Hitmontop can use Endeavor, Mach Punch, Hidden Power Ghost, and Endure with a Salac Berry on a lead set for a surprise way to make progress on offensive teams by breaking holes for offensive teammates to capitalize on, but its general consistency is very low compared to standard Rapid Spin sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Gligar is not hit meaningfully by any of Hitmontop's coverage options, and it can set up Swords Dance to threaten Hitmontop with boosted Hidden Power Flying while not caring about Intimidate thanks to Hyper Cutter. Altaria can sit in on Hitmontop and stall it out with Toxic, as even Rock Slide won't be able to 3HKO physically defensive variants. Scyther can find entry on resisted moves or Rapid Spin and threaten Hitmontop with a strong Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Flying, but it has to be mindful of Rock Slide when switching in, and Rock Slide Hitmontop can find entry on a Scyther that is Choice-locked into Hidden Power Bug to scare it out. Fearow is similar to Scyther with a stronger Flying-type STAB option in Drill Peck, but finds less entry due to not resisting Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Slowking, Xatu, and Grumpig use their resistance to Fighting to find entry and threaten Hitmontop on the special side. None of them are OHKOed by Hidden Power Ghost, and the Psychic-types that are 2HKOed are faster, which means they win one on one. They can even take advantage of Hitmontop switching out by setting up Calm Mind, which lets them exert a lot of offensive pressure even when Hitmontop removes the Spikes they depend on.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Misdreavus, Haunter, and Sableye are immune to Brick Break and can spinblock Hitmontop to keep Spikes up. Even though Misdreavus and Haunter's Psychic don't do amazing damage to Hitmontop while Hidden Power Ghost deals good damage to both, they can use it to pressure if Hitmontop's health is low enough. Haunter can also use Destiny Bond to remove Hitmontop for one of its teammates and for Spikes to stay up for the remainder of the battle. Sableye can completely wall Hitmontop lacking Toxic, with tools like Toxic and Knock Off to harm Hitmontop's longevity and Recover to outlast it.</p> <p><strong>Vileplume</strong>: Vileplume doesn't care about any of Hitmontop's coverage, and it can even heal off the damage it takes from Hitmontop with Leech Seed or Moonlight while making progress through spreading status with Sludge Bomb or Stun Spore. Swords Dance variants are also able to take advantage of Hitmontop to pose a sweeping threat while boosting past Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Muk</strong>: Muk can switch in on Hitmontop to break open holes for its team, only being threatened by Earthquake. Muk can also use Curse + Rest to use Hitmontop as long-term setup fodder to pose a sweeping threat.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Opposing Intimidate hinders the effectiveness of Hitmontop, which already struggles with power. Even Granbull, which is weak to Brick Break, can utilize Intimidate and its great physical bulk to take negligible damage from Hitmontop and potentially set up with Bulk Up. Arcanine doesn't take much damage from Brick Break and threatens Hitmontop with Fire Blast. Opposing Hitmontop are also effective Hitmontop switch-ins, allowing both to reverse Spikes momentum for their teams.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hitmontop finds opportunities to use Rapid Spin by coming in on physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Solrock, as well as a chipped Omastar in 2HKO range for Brick Break, as Hitmontop loses the interaction otherwise. Hidden Power Ghost is needed to check Solrock, and additionally hits other Psychic-types such as Slowking, Grumpig, and Lunatone, as well as Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter, which can spinblock Hitmontop. Hitmontop's third coverage move is important for deciding which Pokemon it will cover while sacrificing other matchups. Earthquake can be chosen to hit Poison-types, such as Tentacruel, Qwilfish, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Muk, and it can hit Electric-types hard without activating Static. Rock Slide is chosen to hit Flying-types such as Scyther, Altaria, and Fearow, usually on the switch in. Toxic helps against irritating walls such as Blastoise, Cradily, Sableye, and Hypno; it also is a generally safe move to use, as it cripples most of Hitmontop's switch-ins without having to guess with a coverage option.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Hitmontop have favored odds to 3HKO Omastar with Brick Break while also dealing important damage to bulky Kangaskhan, Cradily, and Misdreavus. The rest of the EVs are put in HP and Defense to let Hitmontop switch in on physical attackers. More EVs can be placed into Speed to hit benchmarks for outspeeding certain Pokemon; 136 Speed EVs let Hitmontop outspeed offensive Omastar, and 184 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed defensive Kangaskhan variants. However, the extra Speed isn't always worth the loss in bulk unless it's needed for Hitmontop's team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Hitmontop lacking reliable recovery, it is rarely seen without Wish Kangaskhan, which helps Hitmontop switch into common Kangaskhan switch-ins, such as opposing Kangaskhan, Omastar, Solrock, and Granbull, over the course of a longer game. Hitmontop is vulnerable to status such as Toxic from Kangaskhan when switching into it, which harms its general longevity, so a cleric such as Ampharos, Aromatherapy Vileplume, or Altaria helps patch up this issue. Hitmontop tends to invite in setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther, Gligar, Curse Muk, and Swords Dance Vileplume, and it lacks power to prevent Curse Lapras, Curse Walrein, and Feraligatr from setting up on it. For this reason, Hitmontop pairs well with a phazer such as Encore Walrein, Roar Blastoise, Roar Altaria, or Perish Song Misdreavus. Hitmontop appreciates Pokemon that can switch into the Flying-types it tends to draw in, including most of the aforementioned Pokemon like Walrein, Altaria, Lapras, and Misdreavus. In return, Hitmontop switches into and checks Solrock, which threatens these Pokemon. Hitmontop can be used in the lead position to Intimidate physical attackers and win the 1v1 against leads like Ampharos, Kangaskhan, Walrein, and Nidoking, or it can be used in the back to switch into physical attackers or Spikers mid-game when it needs to.</p>"

With its incredible Speed, usable Special Attack, and Explosion, it makes for a good revenge killer and suicide wallbreaker on offensive teams. Electrode can reliably revenge kill Scyther, which other Electric-types like Manectric and Electabuzz can only Speed tie with. It also pairs well with Electric-types, though, as they share a lot of checks that Electrode can lure in and destroy with Explosion. However, Electrode's offensive stats leave something to be desired when comparing it to Electabuzz and Manectric, and although its Explosion hits hard, it won't KO bulkier Pokemon without some prior damage. It also has less than stellar bulk, so it won't withstand most super effective hits, and even strong neutral hits like Kangaskhan's Double-Edge will KO it without much prior damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is an option over Substitute on some teams to easily KO Wish Kangaskhan with Explosion.

Cradily completely sits on Electrode unless it runs Toxic, as it is 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ice at best. Vileplume is also an effective counter, as it resists Thunderbolt and isn't 2HKOed by unboosted Hidden Power Ice.

Explosion leaves a serious dent in most foes despite Electrode's horrible Attack. This is helped because Electrode's checks do not resist Normal; the main Pokemon that does, Omastar, wants nothing to do with Thunderbolt, and Ghost-types in Misdreavus and Banette are fairly uncommon and don't enjoy Thunderbolt either. Hidden Power Ice lets it OHKO Gligar and push damage on Vileplume so Explosion KOes. Toxic can cripple Cradily, which otherwise walls Electrode.</p> <p>As for its item, a pinch Berry is the most common choice. Petaya Berry is generally the best choice for its Special Attack boost, but Liechi Berry can be useful for instantly taking down a bulkier Explosion target like Kangaskhan, Vileplume, Ampharos, or the uncommon Hypno. Leftovers is another option, especially if Electrode is running Toxic, as it gives it longevity and potentially more Substitute uses. Magnet is useful if Electrode is running a Speed-boosting nature to give it a much needed damage boost to Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Because its Speed is so high, Electrode generally doesn't need a lot of Speed EVs unless you want it to outrun a specific boosted target, such as Gorebyss in rain or Salac Berry-boosted base 50s, 55s, or 60s like Banette. Not requiring a lot of Speed EVs means that it can invest in Special Attack, Attack, and even bulk at the same time. The spread shown above puts Electrode at 340 Speed with a neutral nature, letting it outrun base 105s like Scyther, Manectric, and Electabuzz. The spread also makes Substitute take exactly 25% of Electrode's health, allowing for the quickest activation of its pinch Berry. If not using one, this benchmark is unnecessary. 116 Defense EVs let Electrode take maximum Attack Kangaskhan's Earthquake. If you are not using any HP investment, 128 EVs will do the same. The other EVs are dumped into Attack for Explosion. An alternative spread is 100 Atk / 192 SpA / 216 Spe with a Naive nature, which revenge kills Swift Swim Gorebyss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Electrode needs help to break through bulkier Pokemon, Spikes is a natural fit with it. Omastar and Glalie make for good Spikes users, since the former can switch into Kangaskhan and fit on almost any team, and the latter is great at getting Spikes up early on for Electrode to take advantage of. Electrode makes a great partner for a second Electric-type like Manectric or Electabuzz, which greatly appreciates Electrode baiting in and using Explosion on shared counters, and they too appreciate Spikes support. Rain Dance Omastar, Scyther, and Gorebyss also appreciate Electrode's ability to lure in and destroy the likes of Ampharos, Vileplume, and Kangaskhan.</p>"

The last set listed is also an incredible surprise Pokemon and will almost always kill something. Without Spikes it'd be insanely mediocre, but with them it's a pretty good UU. Always consider this fish for any UU team you might be making.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are better Hazers out there, but Qwilfish can Haze if you want him to, maybe in lieu of Destiny Bonding. Ice Beam can be used to for stuff like Claydol and Salamence, I suppose, but most everything else, such as Grass-types, will be hit harder by Sludge Bomb. Counter can be used instead of Destiny Bond, though most stuff KOs Qwilfish and Destiny Bond tends to be a much better move.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>If you're using a mixed set, you should lower his Defense (use Hasty or Lonely nature), especially if you're using Destiny Bond, as that would guarantee that most things kill you, but still lets you switch on Walrein, Blastoise, and other Water-types. You'll want a lot of Attack on the sweeper sets, but more defensive EVs on the Spiker.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Donphan and Claydol can completely shut you down if you don't have Hydro Pump, and Claydol doesn't take much even if you do. Big brother Tentacruel can easily get set up on Qwilfish, and anything that can take a Sludge Bomb and deal some good damage is a pretty good deterrent as well. Most Rapid Spinners tend to have more than enough defense to take you on, so don't get overzealous with the Spikes. Take what you can get. From the \"if it has to Destiny Bond you\" standpoint of counters, Muk and Misdreavus make great switch ins. Gligar and Solrock can also have a say or two in countering this blowfish if they can avoid Hydro Pump.</p>",

The theory is that Qwilfish becomes faster than everything else with Drizzle in effect (and thus should only be used with Kyogre), but can't stay in for long due to its poor defenses and lack of useful resists outside of Ice Beam. A Choice Band, therefore, suits the style of play Qwilfish generally needs to survive. Hydro Pump hits Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross, and does something to Groudon, but Ice Beam will do more to Groudon and Rayquaza. Hydro Pump is probably going to be the more useful move, as Rayquaza is very rare, especially compared to Forretress, and Hydro Pump is not much weaker vs. Groudon than Ice Beam. Sludge Bomb still hits Rayquaza decently hard.</p> <p>The Speed makes it faster than +Speed Deoxys-A in the Rain, the fastest Pokemon you are likely to encounter.</p>"},

Gengar or some other resistant Pokemon comes in to take the Flail after they know you have it? Destiny Bond him back to hell when he tries to do dismantle Qwilfish. Excellent surprise set that is almost guaranteed to get one kill, if not two, even in standard play. Shadow Ball prevents Ghosts from ruining your sweep if you don't want Destiny Bond.</p>"}

I'd go with Reflect on Lunatone, since you could just Baton Pass Calm Minds if you want a Special Defense boost. Lunatone can also Baton Pass Cosmic Power in a Baton Pass chain.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll generally want to max HP, give a token Speed investment, and then stick the rest of your EVs into Defense and possibly Special Attack.

    "overview": "<p>Solrock is a staple in UU play for a good reason: it's immune to Earthquake, resists Normal and Flying, can hurt its opponents, set up dual screens, Baton Pass goodies, and use Explosion whenever it wants. It's been so influential that standards have changed: Gligar packs Toxic, Steel Wing or Iron Tail to deal with it, Fearow uses Steel Wing and some Ground-types use Hidden Power Bug or Ghost. Still, it's good to go. In standard, it can counter some Choice Banders like Salamence and Tauros pretty decently, but you'll have to predict even more accurately because despite its good HP and Defense, it takes quite a beating from neutral or super effective hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Psych Up, Solrock can surprise Snorlax in standard play. Come in when it has some Curses, copy them, and either try to take it out by yourself, or Baton Pass to something to handle it and the rest of your opponent's team. You may want to watch out for Shadow Ball variants though. Cosmic Power can be Baton Passed as well, but usually begs for critical hits, which you don't want. Light Screen, like Reflect, helps Solrock and the rest of the team to take hits better. Since Solrock lures Water- and Grass-types, it's not a bad idea at all.</p> <p>Body Slam can paralyze opponents sometimes, and Fire moves can hurt Steel-types like Skarmory and Forretress in OU. Toxic can help to wear down the Water-types that switch in on Solrock all the time, and finally, he doesn't make a bad Rest / Sleep Talk user. It does take away a lot of its offense though.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For most tankish Solrock, a +Defense nature like Impish is preferred. Max out its HP before working on its defenses; put its Defense somewhere between 260 and 280 to live through most hits decently. Special Defense is welcome to take on Psychic-types. A few Speed EVs isn't a bad idea either, especially if you're using Shadow Ball. Solrock ties Speed with Claydol, and of course it helps against enemy Solrock too.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>In OU, Metagross awaits it with its resistance to Rock Slide and Explosion, and a STAB super effective Meteor Mash for the OHKO. Earthquake without a Choice Band will only 3HKO Metagross, so watch out. Jirachi with Reflect or Wish can be annoying to an extent, but it needs Thunderbolt and a Calm Mind to really hurt Solrock. Swampert's, Milotic's, and Suicune's high durability and STAB Surfs will be a huge problem as well, try to remove them with Explosion and sweep with something else. Check for Protect Swampert first though, or do it on the switch. Skarmory and Forretress take jack from any physical hit you throw at them. Both will put up Spikes, and Forretress sometimes uses Hidden Power Bug. Celebi can Recover off all your hits, and may pack a Grass move to really put a hurting in you. Dusclops can kill you with Shadow Ball, Will-O-Wisp you, block Explosion and Rest/Pain Split off the damage.</p> <p>For UU, generally Water-types and Grass-types can come in on anything Solrock does, and use their STAB attacks to put a hurting in you. Most notably Quagsire, Whiscash, Blastoise, Poliwrath (usually has no Water moves though), Politoed, and Slowking on the Water side, and Meganium, Vileplume, Bellossom, and Tangela on the Grass one. Banette can be a pain with Will-O-Wisp but won't be switching in on Rock Slides or Shadow Balls. You must beware of it when you want to use Explosion though, and the same goes for when your opponent uses Misdreavus.</p>",

Well, Steel Wing can be used to hit Solrock and Lunatone, same for Hidden Power Ghost (which also hits UU Ghosts harder than Drill Peck, but that doesn't cover the Rock / Steel-types). Hidden Power Ground, however, is better overall, especially against Aggron. Double-Edge is another option over Return just for that extra punch. Double-Edge from Fearow HURTS UUs that aren't named Golem or Aggron (and other walls with a Rock / Steel typing).

Ghost-types like Sableye and Banette can be used too. You should, however, be careful while switching stuff into Fearow again as it can hit pretty hard if the player predicts right.

Quick Attack, despite being weak, can sometimes make all the difference when you need it the most, and Hidden Power Ground is there to deal with nasty Rock or Steel-types.</p>"}, "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>Fearow got Baton Pass as an XD move, so it can be nice to pass stuff around when people are expecting the Choice Band version.</p> <p>Use 252 Speed EVs with Jolly if you're using Substitute, or the suggested EVs with Adamant and Agility.</p>"}}

  "Sandslash": {
    "overview": "<p>In standard, the only thing it has over Donphan is Swords Dance, while Donphan has better stats everywhere except in Speed, plus Roar. Therefore, when using Sandslash in standard, use Swords Dance. It's not a bad Pokemon there, maybe even a tad underrated, a Swords Danced Earthquake does about 70% to Milotic and minimally 60% to Swampert. It resists Rock Slide from Tyranitar and Aerodactyl pretty well, you may want to try it out sometime.</p> <p>In UU, Sandslash is a monster. It rivals Quagsire and Gligar as the best Ground around. It can 2HKO Quagsire and Blastoise with a Swords Dance, and if Gligar comes in on a Swords Dance it can take it out one on one, barring Toxic. Its great Defense and the use of Hidden Power Ghost or Rock makes it an alright Solrock switch-in (though Reflect will be annoying), and it can hurt its counters quite well. Be aware of Sandslash's great sweeping powers, whether you're using it or not.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A great example in standard is Snorlax: try coming in on a Curse. Snorlax might be afraid you're going to Swords Dance up on him and will try to attack you, and a Counter will put a big dent into him. It will also be of great use against Choice Banders such as Salamence in standard or Fearow in UU.</p> <p>You can use Rest for that, but Sandslash may have a hard time surviving this without Heal Bell or Aromatherapy somewhere on your team. Same for UU, except that is even more fast-paced. Protect can be handy for lingering Toxic, gaining Leftovers recovery and scouting for Explosion or Choice Banded moves.</p> <p>Focus Punch can come handy if Skarmory comes in on your Swords Dance, but usually it will not hurt anything more than Earthquake and Rock Slide together will. Flail simply doesn't work well as Sandslash doesn't have STAB on it and isn't fast enough to pull it off. Hidden Power Ghost hits Gengar and Misdreavus harder than Rock Slide, and still puts a dent into Celebi, Solrock and Lunatone, and Hidden Power Flying is an awesome option to scare Heracross and Breloom, and it still hits Celebi, so it's pretty useful when you're using this guy in standard. Sandslash makes an average Sleep Talker thanks to his great defense, but you'll be wasting his awesome Swords Dance potential, and the most common Sleep moves come from Milotic, Jynx and Grass-types, none of which Sandslash likes to face.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>It outspeeds Blastoise with no Speed EVs, with the recommended spread, as well as anything slower (Hypno, Solrock, and anything else with 70 base or lower). You'll generally want a ton of Attack, with the rest of the EVs in HP.</p> <p>If you're using Counter, you may want to take EVs from Attack and Speed and put them into HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Its biggest weakness is that it's slow and doesn't take special hits very well, but most special attackers do not take his Earthquakes that easily either.</p> <p>In standard, Skarmory walls Sandslash to an extent. Toxic will mess it up badly, Spikes will hurt the team and Roar and Whirlwind negate Swords Dance. However, Sandslash can also Rapid Spin off the Spikes, and hit Skarmory with a Swords Danced Focus Punch, or try to wear it down with Rock Slide (Swords Danced Rock Slide does about 40%). Suicune, Milotic and Swampert can OHKO with Surf or Hydro Pump, and their high HP and Defense will be troublesome in the early stages. If their health falls below 50%, however, a Swords Danced Earthquake will kill all three of them (except a Bold max Defense max HP Suicune, who has a chance to survive). Salamence and Gyarados can be a pain with Intimidate and immunity to Earthquake, but unless they're using a Special Attack like Hydro Pump, Sandslash can just Swords Dance on the switch and beat them with Rock Slide. Claydol is immune to Earthquake and resists Rock Slide, and usually packs Toxic or a super effective Ice Beam, however he is 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Bug without Swords Dance. Zapdos and Raikou, as well as other Special Attackers that outspeed Sandslash, can come in on a non-attacking move or after Sandslash killed something to finish it off.</p> <p>In UU, a Gligar with Counter or Toxic can mess up Sandslash somewhat, and Quagsire, Blastoise and Walrein can hold the boat to the same extent Suicune, Milotic and Swampert can in standard. Solrock can Reflect up and Lunatone can use Ice Beam, but they should beware of Hidden Power Ghost or Hidden Power Bug. Any STAB Water, Grass or Ice attack will (nearly) kill Sandslash. Meganium makes a great counter with Giga Drain, Razor Leaf or Hidden Power Grass, perhaps in company of Reflect and / or Leech Seed, but once again watch out for Hidden Power Bug. Make sure to use Synthesis to keep it alive.</p>",

      "Counter": {
        "description": "<p>This set is designed to specifically counter some of the biggest threats in the UU metagame, while still being able to get most of the 2HKOs and OHKOs that it needs to. Counter is a great addition to the sweeper set, as it allows Sandslash to destroy many of the Grass-type Pokemon which normally stop it, since their strongest move is Hidden Power Grass, which can be Countered. The basic strategy is to bring Sandslash in on a weak physical attack such as Rock Slide, or any Electric attack. Swords Dance on the switch and then start sweeping. This set allows you to take out Blastoise, Walrein, and Meganium - all common switch-ins to Sandslash -and continue sweeping what you can. Greedy Gligars also get taken out it they try to KO with only +2 or +4 Atk (depending on EVs and nature of the Gligar).</p> <p>Another bonus is that with the 252 HP EVs, and 36 SpD EVs you always survive various STAB Surfs and Ice Beams, while being faster and being able to 2HKO. For example, you can Swords Dance on your opponent's switch to Walrein or Blastoise, and then hit it for a 2HKO with Rock Slide (only on Walrein) or Earthquake, and live through the Surf / Ice Beam to hit them for the KO. Additionally, Sandslash will always survive a Timid Manectric's Hidden Power even after a Petaya boost, as well as almost always surviving a Timid Electabuzz's Ice Punch after a Petaya boost.</p> <p>Rock Slide is the preferred move in the 4th slot, because it has the flinch rate, and Sandslash is able to outspeed most walls. It also allows Sandslash to take out fliers and Levitators that would not take themselves out with Counter, such as Misdreavus and Xatu, but more importantly, Altaria (which is outsped by this variant of Sandslash, allowing you to Rock Slide and possibly flinch before you get hit with Haze or Perish Song). Furthermore, it helps with Scyther and Yanma, not allowing them to set up while you try to Counter. Hidden Power Bug hits Grass types that do not attack with Hidden Power Grass, such as Bellosom and Tangela, and can hit Meganium hard if it uses Light Screen or Leech Seed. Hidden Power Bug also hits Solrock / Lunatone for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ghost, on the other hand, hits not only the previously mentioned Lunatone / Solrock for super effective damage, but also Misdreavus and Xatu as well. Counter takes care of Fearow, so it is not a big trouble if it walls those two attacks. It should be noted, however, that Rock Slide does have lower accuracy than Hidden Power</p>"

Metagross can OHKO with Meteor Mash, Rhydon with Earthquake, and Tyranitar with Focus Punch, but Tyranitar can also opt to 2HKO with Rock Slide (or, if it's Choice Banded, OHKO). Hidden Power helps against Tyranitar to an extent, but Metagross isn't even 2HKOed by Choice Band Hidden Power Ground. Regirock, Scizor and Registeel can take Persian's hits as well and set-up against it. Weezing doesn't resist Normal but nonetheless takes anything that's not a Choice Band Double-Edge easily, it can Will-O-Wisp Persian and Sludge Bomb it to death. Besides all this, lots and lots of things with some kind of Defense and attacking potential can take a hit and beat Persian one-on-one. Swampert, Suicune and Milotic can beat Persian, though Choice Band STAB attacks will bite.</p> <p>In UU, Golem takes anything like a champ and cripples Persian with Earthquake. Solrock doesn't like Shadow Ball or Iron Tail much but it can help it with Reflect and start pounding on Persian with STAB Rock Slide as well. Gligar has to avoid STAB Choice Band Normal hits but takes anything else just fine. Mawile's Normal resistance combined with Intimidate makes it quite a good counter, but beware Hidden Power Fighting or Ground. The same goes to Aggron: it takes no damage from anything but these Hidden Powers.</p> <p>And in the end, Persian still cannot take a hit, so when in doubt just hit Persian with your most powerful move and it will die in two hits maximum. Be wary of getting your counter Hypnotized.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>A viable set for Persian in both standard and UU. It's hard to bring it in, but when you manage to do so, try to deal the damage by predicting your opponent and using the right move at the right time. For standard, Shadow Ball hits Gengar and Dusclops, and your Hidden Power should deal with Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fighting is an OHKO, but without Hidden Power Ground you won't be hurting Metagross. Fake Out is for Ninjask, Alakazam, and things like Reversal Heracross and Medicham, though it won't work if they Endure the Fake Out. Iron Tail can be used if you're unsure if your opponent is going to switch to, for example Tyranitar or Gengar. It hits both quite hard, though it's a tad inaccurate.</p> <p>Use max Speed with Adamant to beat Jolly Fearow. Raise Speed EVs to 180 at the cost of HP if you have Hidden Power Fighting.</p>"},

A risky set as it relies on Hypnosis hitting, but Persian isn't likely to do anything at all if you play it safe. On the bright side, not much is faster than a max Speed Persian, especially not in UU.</p>"}

  "Golduck": {
    "overview": "<p>Golduck stands out in ADV UU as a fast offensive Water-type that has access to Calm Mind. Its strong STAB Hydro Pump rips through even specially bulky foes like Kangaskhan and Ampharos. Golduck is also gifted with a unique ability in Cloud Nine, making it able to put a stop to weather-based hyper offense teams. Cloud Nine disables the Speed boost from Swift Swim and Chlorophyll, allowing Golduck to revenge kill Rain Dance Omastar and Gorebyss and Sunny Day Vileplume, as well as ignoring Sunny Day Arcanine attempting to weaken Hydro Pump by setting up sun. Golduck is a more aggressive alternative to another offensive Water-type in Slowking because of its good Speed, Cloud Nine, and no Rest turns to exploit, making it a better pick on hyper offensive teams that need a backup weather answer.</p> <p>However, Golduck faces competition from the plethora of other offensive Water-types in the tier, such as Rain Dance Omastar, Swords Dance Tentacruel, Gorebyss, and Feraligatr. It lacks the defensive profile that enables Pokemon like Slowking to play the long game, which leaves it easily worn down by stray attacks and status as it tries to set up, and Golduck only makes up for it with its moderately fast base Speed stat. Additionally, Golduck's ability to revenge kill weather sweepers is replicated by Pokemon like Electrode and Ninjask, which can also revenge kill other fast Pokemon like Scyther and Tentacruel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can be used over Psychic to maintain a strong hit on Vileplume while having coverage for Cradily and Altaria, but Golduck would lack coverage for Tentacruel unless it uses Hidden Power Electric, which can't OHKO Omastar. Hypnosis lets Golduck shut down slower Pokemon that threaten it like Ampharos and Lanturn, giving it reliable setup turns. However, dropping any coverage Golduck has severely limits its ability to threaten its checks, and it can be risky to rely on Hypnosis's meager 60% accuracy. Lum Berry prevents Golduck from being worn down by status, letting it attack or set up against an incoming Toxic or paralysis move. Mystic Water allows Golduck to have the damage of a Modest nature on its STAB moves while maintaining the speed tie with Jolly Gligar that Timid provides. However, it's worth noting that while Golduck is not as reliant on the passive recovery of Leftovers as an offensive sweeper, any amount of passive damage, from Spikes to Toxic, permanently sticking makes Golduck much more fragile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Golduck is threatened by every common Electric-type in the tier. Ampharos has good special bulk and a Thunderbolt that can OHKO an unboosted Golduck, Lanturn has ample opportunity to gain entry with its Water resistance, and all other Electric-types, such as Electrode, Electabuzz, and Manectric, outspeed Golduck. However, Ampharos can't switch in too many times throughout a battle and has to stay out of range of a boosted Hydro Pump, while the faster Electric-types can't switch in well at all.</p> <p><strong>Cradily</strong>: Cradily is a bulky special wall that can put Golduck on a timer with Toxic, and it can also use Recover to take advantage of Hydro Pump's low PP as well as rack up Toxic damage. However, Golduck can take advantage of Cradily's general passivity to boost, and it doesn't take much damage from Cradily's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Because Golduck is reliant on its Speed to make successful sweeps, paralysis from Kangaskhan's Body Slam, Vileplume's Stun Spore, or Misdreavus's Thunder Wave stops Golduck dead in its tracks and allows more Pokemon to take advantage of its low bulk.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon with phazing moves like Walrein, Altaria, and Blastoise stand in the way of Golduck's sweep with their good bulk and force it to start again from square one. However, most of these Pokemon don't like taking initial damage from Hidden Power Grass, and they can't threaten Golduck back aside from phazing it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Golduck can find opportunities to set up Calm Mind on Pokemon such as Omastar, Gligar, or Kangaskhan after it uses Rest. The threat of Calm Mind can prevent Kangaskhan from using Rest to stall Golduck, as +1 Hydro Pump 2HKOes specially defensive variants. It can also set up by forcing out a Rock- or Ground-type such as Solrock or Gligar, on which Golduck can enter with a double switch, after they KO Golduck's teammate, or after a teammate has used Explosion. Psychic is used to hit Poison-types that resist Water like Tentacruel, Vileplume, and Qwilfish. Hidden Power Grass is used for other Water-types, notably OHKOing Omastar and 2HKOing Gorebyss, which Golduck can revenge kill by ignoring Swift Swim. While Hydro Pump is Golduck's preferred STAB option, Golduck can also feasibly run Surf over Hidden Power Grass to have guaranteed accuracy against super effective targets while also preserving Hydro Pump's minimal 8 PP.</p> <p>A Timid nature allows Golduck to, at worst, speed tie with other base 85 Speed Pokemon like Gligar, Qwilfish, and Nidoking. A Modest Golduck hits harder with its coverage, allowing for reliable 2HKOs on Vileplume and Tentacruel and a 3HKO on Lanturn without boosts while still outspeeding Omastar, Gorebyss, and Vileplume.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golduck fits well on hyper offensive teams as a Water-type setup sweeper that helps its frail teammates avoid being bowled over by weather sweepers. Golduck appreciates Spikes support from offensive spikers such as Qwilfish and Glalie, which lay as many layers of Spikes down as possible before they use Explosion to bring in an offensive teammate. Yawn Kangaskhan can create entry points for Golduck by threatening the opponent with sleep, which can force out or disable Electric-types and bulky Water-types that would give Golduck trouble when it sets up. Due to Golduck's difficult matchups against Electric-types, it appreciates Ground-types that reliably check them and keep up offensive pressure like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Sandslash; Nidoqueen and Nidoking are fast wallbreakers with great coverage, whereas Sandslash is a Swords Dance sweeper with great physical bulk. In return, Golduck can adequately handle any Water-types that give these Pokemon trouble. If Golduck ever faints before it can complete a sweep, it appreciates a cleaner that can take advantage of the damage Golduck has done and revenge kill foes, such as Scyther, Arcanine, Haunter, or a fast Electric-type like Electrode.</p>"

  "Primeape": {
    "overview": "<p>Primeape can go on a rampage when given some breathing room. Its high Speed and power are nothing to scoff at. Its defenses, however, are really sub-par and will force Primeape to switch out or die more often than not. It relies heavily on sleep inflicting moves like Sleep Powder to come in, which is risky business. In both standard and UU, it can put a great hurting into teams, provided you know how to predict and eliminate its many counters.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Primeape can Overheat Skarmory, but its STAB Cross Chop and Focus Punch will be much more useful in other situations, and it's more of a one-time deal anyway as it sharply cuts your Special Attack. It won't even OHKO Skarmory (though Forretress and Scizor will be fried). Thunder or Thunderbolt work against Skarmory as well, and nothing else. Ice Punch, as idiotic as it seems, is good in UU because it hits Gligar and will usually 2HKO it. Thief can be used to steal Leftovers or Choice Band from something that walls you, comes handy in both standard and UU. Screech can force switches or cause massive damage from Cross Chop. With Taunt, you stop status from hitting you, but it's more likely that Primeape will be hit up straight on his weak defenses. This is why you may want to use Counter, with or without Taunt. Taunt / Counter Primeape can surprise the hell out of Gligar, Vileplume, Skarmory, Gyarados and some other things if they come into you.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>For every usual non-Reversal set, minimally 300 in standard to beat Adamant Salamence and everything else with 100 base Speed and no boosting nature. In UU, 296 is a nice number as well to beat Jolly Gligar (rare, but nice anyway), but 308 is preferable for Adamant Fearow and Jolly Kangaskhan. Use 264 Speed minimally for standard Reversal sets, and make sure your HP is not divisible by four when using Substitute with it. For the rest, Primeape should stack its Attack as much as possible.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>One great counter is Gligar, as it takes neutral damage or not very effective from all Primeape's attacks not named Ice Punch, and has decent Defense. Not a lot can switch in on Primeape in UU matches; utilizing two Pokemon to deal with Primeape is another method you could try. The Choice Band set will lose to a combination of Misdreavus and Muk or Vileplume. In all honesty the best way to beat Primeape is to attack it before it attacks you.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Earthquake should take care of Muk and do some more damage to Electric and Fire-types, as well as helping against Grass / Poisons like Vileplume. Vileplume can also be taken care of with Hidden Power Flying and can be quite important for Primeape to beat, as Vileplume provides a switch-in for Primeape every time it tries to use Sleep Powder, and often tries to wall Primeape as it resists Cross Chop. The IVs given are for Hidden Power Flying. Outside of that, there is little reason to use Hidden Power Flying, unless you really want to hurt Heracross and Breloom badly in standard. The rest of Primeape's move's uses in UU are quite easy to tell: Hidden Power Ghost is for Hypno, Grumpig and Misdreavus and Rock Slide for random Fliers.</p>"},
      "Bulk Up": {"description": "<p>This works a bit like the standard Raikou: set-up your offense and defense at the same time, protect against status and gain time with Substitute, then hit hard with STAB and a secondary move. Earthquake should only be used in UU, all the others are fair game for both metagames. There will always be something that walls you, but this set requires less prediction and can really screw opponents over in late game, or if they rely on something like Toxic to stop Primeape.</p>"},
      "Reversal": {"description": "<p>The fastest STAB Reversal in the game. Coming from a respective 339 Attack, Primeape can be quite a monster with this set, provided there is no Sand Stream up and no Quick Attack (or a similar move) in the way. Even if there is a Quick Attacker, Primeape can always switch out and come back later (as long as there are no Spikes) and launch its Reversal. It's unlikely that something like Quick Attack Fearow or Fake Out Kangaskhan is going to switch into that. Use Bulk Up for an easier set-up, or Focus Punch to do some good damage on something like Skarmory before it Drill Pecks you to death. Endure can be a safer route in some situations, and usually works better with Endure.</p>"}

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel is truly a Pokemon to be feared in UU, and can compete in standard as well. Its offensive power with Swords Dance-boosted Sludge Bombs combined with Hydro Pump tends to be just too much for teams in both tiers. However, Tentacruel can only really switch into fellow Water-types and perhaps Skarmory, because he has low Defense, and is weak to Thunderbolt and Earthquake, two of the most common attacks in the game. Psychic weakness doesn't help either. His immunity to Toxic and resistance to Water and Ice helps a lot though, it makes him a great counter to Milotic and Suicune in standard, as well as Blastoise and Walrein in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physical Hidden Power (most likely Ground, but Fighting works too) is Tentacruel's only real option for attacking, aside from Sludge Bomb, to take advantage of Swords Dance.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Usually Tentacruel should have 310 Speed in UU, unless it is a more defensive set, is an important point to hit, as the only used Pokemon that will be faster than you are the occasional Jolly Fearow, and Timid Manectric / Electabuzz. Hasty is the best nature for mixed sets, as Tentacruel's massive Special Defense is one of its major selling points, but if you're not using your Attack or Special Attack at all, Timid or Jolly should be used respectively. Stack the attacking stat(s) you're using on sweeping Tentacruel, otherwise you'll want to max out HP and put some in Special Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Standard: Swampert is the best all-around counter for Tentacruel, as long as Tentacruel isn't packing the rare Giga Drain. It can soak up Sludge Bombs thanks to its resistance, and use its STAB Earthquake to dish out damage. Steels like Skarmory and Metagross get in the way when Tentacruel wants to sweep with Swords Dance, because Skarmory will Roar / Whirlwind away the boosts while Metagross will Earthquake. A few Surfs or Hydro Pumps should do them in though. Gengar is 4x resistant to Sludge Bomb and can Thunderbolt Tentacruel, but again, beware of Surf or Hydro Pump. Zapdos, Jolteon and Raikou may take quite some damage from a Swords Danced Sludge Bomb, but they're quite fast (Zapdos ties with Tentacruel, the other two are faster) and pack STAB Thunderbolts. Beware of Mirror Coat, however. Salamence and Gyarados can Earthquake Tentacruel and resist his Water moves, but their Intimidate won't work on Clear Body versions and Salamence has to watch out for Ice Beam.</p> <p>UU: Quagsire is an even better counter than Swampert because of Water Absorb, for the rest he works in the same way. Whiscash plays a mini-Swampert as well, but to a lesser extent. Hypno with some Defense EVs and Reflect can pose trouble, paralyzing Tentacruel with Thunder Wave or hitting hard with STAB Psychic. A Swords Danced Sludge Bomb will bang him up sooner or later though. Kangaskhan can take a beating and try for a paralysis with Body Slam or hit hard with Earthquake. Walrein can Earthquake, or Encore Substitute or Swords Dance, but again these Swords Danced Sludge Bombs hurt. For the rest, Tentacruel is pretty hard to beat in UU. Your best bet is hitting it hard when you can, preferably with Earthquake. If your team is full of physical offense, Psychic, and Thunderbolt, you can just make it impossible for Tentacruel to ever switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Druidcruel": {
        "description": "<p>Simple idea that works pretty well. Switch into something that will switch out once it sees Tentacruel and use Substitute. Wear down Steels, Rocks, and Grounds with Hydro Pump or Surf, and, later on, Swords Dance up and Sludge Bomb away. Works very well in standard, but really shines in UU, because about everything that resists Sludge Bomb is weak to your Water move. The main physical walls are Walrein (who cannot touch Tentacruel with the standard set of Rest, Sleep Talk, Toxic, Ice Beam), Gligar (who is OHKOed by a Water move), and Solrock (who is also OHKOed). In OU, you have stuff like Suicune with Roar, Weezing, Swampert, and the like around to ruin your fun.</p> <p>Surf has the obvious accuracy advantage over Hydro Pump (and the slightly less obvious PP advantage, but that's not that big of a deal, as the Water move's function is solely to hit a very limited number of Pokemon), but Hydro Pump's power can come in handy. With these EVs, Surf will never OHKO max HP Aggron, but Hydro Pump always will. Hydro Pump will easily OHKO Gligar, even if it has max HP, while Surf will always OHKO min HP Gligar, but bulkier versions will survive. Hydro Pump also just barely ekes out an OHKO on max HP Solrock.</p>"

      "Special Sweeper": {

Absolutely owns some common counters to the standard Tentacruel (Swampert and Quagsire, Salamence etc.). Hidden Power Electric can be used as a fourth slot also to take care of Gyarados who can mess this set up pretty well otherwise. Mantine in UU cannot do much to Tentacruel, so usually you'll just want to keep Substitute. Try not to reveal that you are using a special Tentacruel until the surprise will get you a KO (Substitute and Surf / Hydro Pump should be the only moves you use at first).</p> <p>With Timid you can expect Tentacruel to outspeed everything of 105 base Speed and under as long as they don't have a Speed boosting nature (so Adamant Salamence and Modest Zapdos in OU, and Modest Manectric / Electabuzz in UU), and anything base 90 Speed or lower even if they have a +Speed nature (including Kangaskhan and Gligar), but with Modest you will have more attacking power. Just max out Speed if you go Modest, or, alternately, go as low as 280 Speed to beat Adamant Kangaskhan.</p>"
      },
      "Mirror Coat": {
        "description": "<p>The idea is to set up a Barrier or two, forcing them to attack you from Tentacruel's Special side. Usually this will draw out Electrics like Zapdos, and allow Tentacruel to Mirror Coat that STAB Thunderbolt right in their face. Tentacruel's Special Defense is pretty good, so just by maxing HP, you will survive even a max Special Attack Zapdos Thunderbolt as long as you're on full health. Giga Drain can be used to keep Quagsire and Swampert off your ass, but Toxic will stop them from stalling against you and either switch out or attack you straight up. Hydro Pump is there for some general STAB damage.</p> <p>While it looks nice on paper, it usually won't work that well. You'll find a lot of people trying to set up something like Substitute or Calm Mind from the likes of Raikou, Gengar and Alakazam on Tentacruel, which he cannot really do anything against. Sometimes they will just weaken with Tentacruel with something else, and then kill you with their Thunderbolt. Or they could repeatedly Earthquake you until it goes critical, which pierces Barrier's defense boost. Still, it can be very neat, and this set actually makes a decent Suicune counter, as even if it Calm Minds to the max, it won't OHKO with Surf and risk a Mirror Coat to the face, not to mention Toxic will keep forcing it to Rest.</p> <p>For UU, this might work against Lunatone or Manectric, but again beware of Substitute and Calm Mind.</p>"
      },
      "Utility": {"description": "<p>As mentioned in the previous set, Tentacruel can take special hits quite well, and this support set takes advantage of it. Come in on Waters (especially Cloyster) to Rapid Spin those Spikes away or to Toxic foes. Haze helps against Suicune's Calm Mind, or when Curse Snorlax is taking a nap. Note that Haze is illegal with Rapid Spin. Surf or Hydro Pump is there to hit Gengar who may try to block Rapid Spin and Toxic, but it won't do much against Dusclops or Misdreavus. Fillers like Mirror Coat and Sludge Bomb can be put in the last slot. The main problem with this Tentacruel set is that it's weak to many common attacks, and that Blastoise fills its role pretty much better in UU.</p>"}

  "Rapidash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rapidash suffers from being a Fire-type, having to compete with a lot of other Pokemon that all have the same syndrome: high Attack but no physical STAB, and no offensive movepool to speak of. Rapidash's redeeming factors are Baton Pass and Hypnosis mostly, so try to use these when using Rapidash. You really should only use Rapidash in UU.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quick Attack is present just to counter Pokemon with Reversal and the like. It can use Double Kick on a physical attacking set to open up room so you don't have to use Hidden Power Fighting, and this works against Substitute Tyranitar in standard to an extent.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Rapidash needs 307 Speed minimum to be faster than Jolly Kangaskhan, and a load of other UU threats like Gligar. This requires 244 Speed EVs without a nature, and, if you're going that high, you might as well max it out to go for the tie against other Rapidash, Modest Electabuzz, and Modest Manectric. Alternately, you can use a +Speed nature and bring yourself to 310 Speed, which still beats all Kangaskhan, but also outpaces the aforementioned Modest Electabuzz / Manectric, which requires 144 EVs and a +Speed nature. Most sets will then max one of the attacking stats, and then pump the rest of the EVs into the other attacking stat if you're using a mixed Rapidash, or HP if you are not. The Baton Passer should have more HP EVs than that, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Suicune and any other Water-type shuts it out. Dugtrio can actually survive anything Rapidash throws at it except Fire Blast, and then trap it and kill with Earthquake. Aerodactyl has the advantage of resisting Fire, is faster, and has two moves that can OHKO (Earthquake and Rock Slide). Salamence easily beats Rapidash without Hidden Power Ice, same for Dragonite. All these counters should be careful for Hypnosis, if it hits of course. In Underused matches other Fire-type Pokemon generally stop it dead, if you don't have Hidden Power Ice then Altaria counters Rapidash quite easily being resistant to Fire Blast and Solar Beam and Natural Cure takes care of Hypnosis. Walrein can stall it out with Toxic, thanks to Thick Fat, or just attack it outright with Surf, same goes for Blastoise. Quagsire beats Rapidash without Hidden Power Grass. Hypno can stall out anything but a Toxic variant. Cradily stops all but the Sunny Day set, and even that one can easily get PP stalled, because the chance to get a Critical Hit is small with only 8 Fire Blast PP, and Flamethrower won't do enough.</p>",

      "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>Hypnosis is an option on this set if your opponent doesn't have a Pokemon that Rapidash can scare off (like Skarmory), giving you a free turn to set up a Substitute / Agility.

Obviously, this set works in UU as well.</p> <p>You may not need as many Speed EVs if you are using Agility, but it might come handy to get in that crucial Hypnosis or Hidden Power. The IVs given are for Hidden Power Ice, which should generally only be used in OU, as Hidden Power Grass is more important to hit Waters like Blastoise, Walrein, and Quagsire there.</p>"},
      "SunnyBeam": {"description": "<p>It doesn't have the best Special Attack stat, but can catch your opponent by surprise. Hypnosis is still effective vs. Pokemon with Natural Cure like Blissey. Sunny Day as they come in, Hypnosis.

Hidden Power Ice hits Salamence in OU, but the main Pokemon for which it's used in UU, is Gligar, who is OHKOed by Fire Blast, and almost always OHKOed by Flamethrower anyway, so Hypnosis is probably better. Sunny Day keeps Rapidash safe from Surf as it attacks.</p> <p>Once again, the IVs are only if you choose Hidden Power Ice.</p>"},

Imprison is very unorthodox and works in very rare circumstances, stay away from it until you've tried out the standard Muk.

Put some EVs in Special Attack if you have Psychic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Even with Reflect, Gligar and Ground Pokemon in general will switch into Hypno's Thunder Waves easily and get a free hit on whatever switches in. Banette is a bit risky because you don't want it to take a Thunder Wave, but it deals a ton of damage with its STAB Shadow Ball. Hidden Power Dark Grumpig says 'sup to Hypno as well by Substituting on the Thunder Wave and Calm Minding while Hypno is saddened.</p>",

It can be an annoyance if you don't have things to faint this before it Thunder Waves your whole team and sets up a Reflect. If you're using this, you will most likely switch in on something that has the potential to use a sleeping move or hit you with a special attack. While not being much of an offensive guy, it takes special hits like few others in UU. Psychic and Seismic Toss both work. It really depends though, do you want something that can hit Pokemon such as Gligar harder, or being able to stop Pokemon with Substitute from setting up as easily? It's up to you and your overall team. If you use Protect, use it with Toxic to further stall turns, but both Toxic and Thunder Wave can be used with Reflect. Use Counter with Toxic, as well, because it really ruins a perfect prediction to have them fully paralyzed when you Counter, thus destroying the surprise.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is one of the most used Pokemon in the UnderUsed environment. Bulky defenses, high HP, above-average Speed, high Attack with a fantastic movepool and Normal STAB makes Kangaskhan very dangerous. Kangaskhan can be difficult to stop; more than one resist is often necessary to handle it. When building your UU team, make sure that your team can handle Kangaskhan!</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used as your Normal move for Paralysis. Roar can stop random stat uppers, especially the odd UU BP team (as Mr. Mime cannot stand up to STAB Returns to block your Roar), and Yawn works as a sort of pseudo-phazing move.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Near max HP and a lot of Attack in the first set, with the rest in Speed. On the Choice Band set, just max out Attack and Speed. On the Reversal set, max out Attack to ensure that Reversal can do a decent amount of damage. Speed will have to be 264 in OU, with an Adamant nature, but in UU, you can use much lower speeds, such as 251 to beat an Electrode without +Speed, or even less, depending on just how much you fear Electrode. The remainder of EVs should go into either Defense. Use no HP EVs so that you end up with 1% after 4 Substitutes, instead of 25% after 3, or Reversal will be much weaker. Of course, the extra EVs elsewhere will do virtually nothing, so you'll most likely just want to max your Speed to keep other Salac Pokemon from outspeeding you.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Often more than one Rock-type is needed to fully stop Kangaskhan. A bulky Omastar can handle it, Reflect Solrock can handle it. Golem, which is rather uncommon, can switch into it and scare off Kangaskhan, unless it is of course packing Earthquake or Focus Punch. Walrein and Blastoise can easily stall it with Rest and Toxic, unless it's holding a Choice Band. If it has a Choice Band, you'll need to use resists.</p>",

Return or Shadow Ball anything in sight until your HP is at around 50%. Then Rest the damage off and wait for one Sleep turn, thanks to Early Bird. Kangaskhan can also use Double-Edge effectively. Wish is also an option; with some defensive EVs, Kangaskhan can be bulky, which will allow it to be an effective Wish-passer. Watch out for status.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Kangaskhan is no Slaking, but it can act as a Choice Bander quite well. Its Speed is rather high in UU to pull this off. Because Focus Punch hits very few things in UU, Fake Out can be used to stop Pokemon with Substitute and a Salac, or just for a little bit of extra damage against a Pokemon you normally couldn't take. However, Focus Punch can be useful to predict Walrein and Cradily, and guarantees an OHKO on Aggron, who can potentially survive your Earthquake only to Counter it back.</p>"},
      "Wish Staller": {"description": "<p>This set simply refuses to die, as very few things can do enough to Kangaskhan to overcome Wish and 2 turns of Leftovers for each hit, and those few Pokemon (for instance, Hitmonlee) often have very low Defense, letting your STAB Normal hit them hard. It's completely walled by Aggron, but Wish support lets Pokemon like Gligar switch into that all day. Counter can stop that nicely, but you risk being Thunder Waved or having Aggron just set up a Substitute. You could also stick Roar on there over Protect or Return if you have some Spikes down for even more stall. You may want to focus on more Special Defense if you have Counter to ensure that Counter KOs the opponent when they use a physical attack.</p>"},

Make sure when you are using this set, to make sure you have 404 HP or more (at least 212 HP EVs) to make 101 HP Substitutes, as this means Seismic Toss will need two hits to break the Substitute.</p>"},

  "Scyther": {
    "overview": "<p>Scyther is an excellent offensive Pokemon with one of the highest Speed stats in the tier and an exceptional base 110 Attack. It capitalizes on the progress made by its teammates, allowing it to function as a wallbreaker, revenge killer, cleaner, and sweeper. Scyther's sheer power with its STAB moves lets it 2HKO or 3HKO many relevant Pokemon, such as Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, Ampharos, Solrock, and Vileplume. Swarm punishes any Pokemon swinging at it, as its bulk lets it dodge an OHKO from most neutral attacks, like Kangaskhan's Double-Edge. Scyther works very well on offense and balance teams that uphold Spikes pressure and need a backbone of fast offense and priority, and this makes it one of the best late-game Pokemon.</p> <p>Scyther can, however, have a lack of longevity, as it has weaknesses to common attacking types in Electric, Ice, Fire, and Rock, and it hates being statused by paralysis and Toxic. Choice Band sets can end up being reliant on prediction, and they can allow more Pokemon to gain entry. It can be hard to find entry for Scyther due to its reliance on being kept healthy late-game and its common switch-ins forcing its team to play on the defensive, only coming in through Ground-type moves, double switches, or revenge kills.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used on the Choice Band set over Hidden Power Ground to hit all of Cradily, Granbull, and Walrein on the switch in. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Flying-types like Altaria while maintaining coverage for Arcanine and Walrein as they switch in. Both Hidden Power choices lower Scyther's Speed IVs, which guarantees opposing base 105 Speed Pokemon can revenge kill it, so Hidden Power Ground, Bug, and Flying are preferable choices. On Reversal sets, Salac Berry can be substituted for Liechi Berry to make Reversal stronger, but this comes at the cost of risking the Speed tie against base 105 Speed foes and being too slow to avoid a revenge kill from Electrode and Ninjask.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar can comfortably switch into Scyther with its Normal and Flying resistances coupled with its sky-high Defense, and it can aptly pressure with Surf or lay down Spikes. Aggron and Golem pose similar problems and can OHKO Scyther with Rock STAB attacks. Although Aggron fears Hidden Power Ground, Omastar and Golem can tank it at least a few times. Other Rock-types like Cradily and Solrock can come in on moves they resist and threaten Scyther back, but they have trouble dealing with Hidden Power Bug.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Altaria and Gligar can both defensively check Scyther with their great bulk, Bug-type resistance, and Spikes immunity while also offensively checking Scyther with super effective coverage. Altaria is very bulky and uses Scyther as an opportunity to use Heal Bell, and it can use Roar on Swords Dance Scyther, forcing it to start the process all over again. Gligar can gain turns to set up its own Swords Dance boosts, hits back hard with Hidden Power Flying, and has priority to beat Salac Reversal sets. Both still need to take caution against Choice Band variants, as Hidden Power Flying and Double-Edge can 2HKO Gligar and non-physically defensive Altaria.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Ampharos is a mixed wall that zaps Scyther with a strong STAB Thunderbolt and can come in on Scyther's contact moves, potentially paralyzing it through Static. While other Electric-types lack Ampharos's bulk, they can Speed tie Scyther or outspeed in the case of Electrode.</p> <p><strong>Walrein</strong>: Walrein is a bulky wall that can threaten Scyther with its STAB Ice Beam, and it can phaze out any attempts of sweeping with Swords Dance through Encore or Roar.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Users</strong>: Granbull and Arcanine’s Intimidate softens the blow of Scyther’s moves and forces Scyther's team to play on the defensive. Arcanine has a brutal STAB Fire Blast, resists Hidden Power Bug, and has priority to stuff any revenge kills at low health and stop Scyther from Reversal sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Electrode and Ninjask can reliably revenge kill Scyther and can use their entry as an opportunity for their own offense.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Choice Band Scyther is the most common set for its immediate power and ability to revenge kill fast Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Tentacruel. Scyther also has an incredible max Speed of 339, which is only outsped by Electrode and Ninjask, rivaling its Choice Band user competition like Fearow, Nidoking, and Hitmonlee.</p> <p>Hidden Power Bug is Scyther's main STAB attack for hitting neutral targets and is very powerful when Scyther is in Swarm range. It also provides coverage for Psychic-types, like Slowking and Solrock, and it can be used as a way to avoid contact abilities like Static. Double-Edge provides a very powerful neutral hit to most targets, including Flying-types like Gligar and Altaria, and its recoil can be helpful in pushing Scyther into Swarm range for a boosted Hidden Power Bug. Aerial Ace hits opposing Scyther, Vileplume, Ghost-types like Haunter and Misdreavus, and Fighting-types like Hitmontop. Quick Attack provides very useful priority against Reversal sweepers like opposing Scyther, serves as an additional check to chipped weather sweepers like Sunny Day Vileplume and Rain Dance Gorebyss, and helps check other priority from Arcanine. Silver Wind and Hidden Power Flying can be used as alternatives to Hidden Power Bug and Aerial Ace. This gives Scyther less contact moves, a stronger Flying STAB attack, and access to possible omniboosts with Silver Wind. Using both Silver Wind and Aerial Ace allows Scyther to use another Hidden Power over Double-Edge, such as Hidden Power Ground for Arcanine and Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types that like to come in on Choice Band Scyther.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Scyther fits well onto Spikes offense with Omastar and Qwilfish. Spikes help Scyther break through bulky Pokemon more easily and wears down its checks as they switch in. Omastar is also a physical wall that can help to check Kangaskhan, Granbull, and opposing Scyther. Since Scyther is very status-prone, cleric Pokemon like Ampharos, Vileplume, and Altaria can heal off any stray Toxic or paralysis thrown at it. Scyther also appreciates a check to Arcanine, such as Tentacruel or Blastoise. Scyther is less effective at wallbreaking after Intimidate, and these teammates allow for safe switch-ins and can remove Spikes for Scyther's team. Lanturn can resist any BoltBeam coverage thrown Scyther's way from Electric-types, Walrein, offensive Omastar, and special attacking Ghost-types. Pokemon that block Rapid Spin, like Haunter and Misdreavus, help keep Spikes on the opposing side of the field and provide valuable offensive utility, such as Haunter's Thief, Will-O-Wisp, and Destiny Bond and Misdreavus's Thunder Wave.</p>"

      "Salac Reversal": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Salac Reversal Scyther is a dangerous late-game sweeper that is nearly impossible to stop without a priority move post-Speed boost. The choice of Hidden Power is mostly up to personal preference; Hidden Power Bug is boosted by Swarm and hits Psychic-types hard, while Hidden Power Flying has better coverage for Poison- and Ghost-types. Substitute is used to bring Scyther's HP down to 1% and capitalize on switches, allowing Scyther to use Swords Dance behind the Substitute. Scyther's HP cannot be divisible by 4 for Substitute sets to activate Salac Berry, so 4 EVs should be put into HP to make four Substitutes and for Reversal to be at maximum power. Endure allows Scyther to reliably get into Salac Berry range even if it took damage prior, lets it take hits from faster Pokemon, and gives it more freedom to set up Swords Dance at least once against most targets, since it is rarely OHKOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Salac Reversal Scyther fits very well onto hyper offense teams, as it can outspeed and sweep every Pokemon without priority, and it can force damage onto bulkier targets. It can generally force the removal of at least one Pokemon for sweeper teammates to capitalize on. This Scyther set appreciates Spikes set early in the match for it to sweep more easily, benefitting from leads such as Qwilfish and Glalie that get as many layers of Spikes as possible then use Explosion to keep up momentum. Scyther also loves support that helps it enter freely, such as Yawn Kangaskhan, to force a switch or give Scyther a way to prey on the slept Pokemon. Explosion users, such as Electrode, Solrock, Haunter, and Muk, fit well as teammates, as they can remove key Pokemon for Scyther to make a full sweep or at least provide valuable chip if Explosion fails to KO, as well as giving free entry for Scyther. Since Arcanine and Gligar stand in the way of Reversal Scyther's sweep, it appreciates offensive teammates that force damage onto them early, such as Arcanine, offensive Kangaskhan, and Water-types like Gorebyss, Golduck, and Feraligatr. Ground-types like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Sandslash can check opposing Electric-types that threaten Scyther while making significant progress of their own.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Scyther is a fast setup sweeper that can clean up late-game with its STAB moves and Hidden Power Ground as well as break holes in the opposition for teammates to capitalize on and clean up.</p> <p>Scyther prefers dual STAB moves on Swords Dance sets, usually using Silver Wind and Aerial Ace. Silver Wind is its primary STAB move, giving it access to dangerous omniboosts, and it is further boosted when Scyther is in Swarm range. Aerial Ace allows for useful coverage against various Flying-, Fighting-, and Ghost-types like Gligar, Haunter, Misdreavus, and Hitmontop. These options free up a slot for Hidden Power Ground for hitting Poison-, Rock-, and Steel-types like Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Omastar, and Aggron. Alternatively, Quick Attack gives Scyther a priority move if it can forgo the coverage of Hidden Power Ground, allowing access to a Hidden Power with STAB.</p> <p>The item choice can be team-dependent but is mostly up to preference. Leftovers helps Scyther passively heal any damage it takes and have more longevity, while Lum Berry is used when Scyther doesn't have cleric support and lets it set up in the face of Toxic or paralysis that would otherwise shut down any chance Scyther has at sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Omastar and Qwilfish helps Swords Dance Scyther muscle past bulky Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Walrein. Thief support from Omastar, Tentacruel, Arcanine, Haunter, and Electabuzz further facilitates the sweep by removing Leftovers from defensive Pokemon that rely on passive recovery, meaning the damage they take from Scyther's boosted moves and Spikes will be permanent. Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel, Walrein, and Lanturn synergize well, as they can threaten Omastar, Arcanine, Altaria, and Walrein, which can otherwise stand in the way of Scyther's sweep, and they are good at making progress for Scyther to take advantage of. Fearow and Gligar make for good partners, as they are fast mid-game wallbreakers that can back up Scyther's general lack of priority and make for a brutal one-two punch of Flying offense.</p>"

You could use Barrier to try and make Electabuzz survive a little longer / survive a STAB Earthquake and Counter it back for a quick kill. Thief is just an awesome move. Steal Leftovers from the most annoying staller you can find and laugh.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll need at least 244 Speed EVs to hit 307, beating Jolly Kangaskhan. Alternately, you could use 136 Speed EVs with a +Speed nature. Give it -Attack or -Defense, depending on whether you are using a Fighting move. Put the rest in Attack and Special Attack, always focusing more on Special Attack. The only time you're going to want to put some in Defense is for the last set, where you should focus on Defense, HP and Special Attack, with a little bit in its mediocre Special Defense, making it either Modest or Timid. A +Speed nature is almost exclusively to beat out Fearow, a very deadly UU Choice Bander. Otherwise, Electabuzz beats mostly the same things regardless of nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Grumpig and Hypno are easily able to switch into it with their beefy Special defense and Muk is quite useful, seeing as it will soak up any of Electabuzz's moves with its HP. You might also try Lanturn and Ampharos, as Electabuzz is unable to really put a big dent into them, due to their resistance to most of Electabuzz's moves, and high Special Defense stats. Meganium and Vileplume could put up a fight, despite being weak to one of its moves.</p>",

Watch out for Thieving from Grumpig, however, as it might be a Trickbanding variant (if it tries to Trick right away, though, you'll just steal the Choice Band, and it will Trick it right back onto itself, so you do a 40 power Super Effective move for free). Substitute is to block status and help with prediction. Not much is hit in UU by Focus Punch / Cross Chop that isn't hit harder by your other moves, which is why it's not on here.</p>"},

It hits hard and fast, doesn't have that prominent 4x Flying weakness that Heracross has, and has got a great movepool. Pinsir suffers the most from not having a decent STAB attack, but, with the element of surprise backing, he can be a worthwhile investment. It has the advantage of not being walled by Solrock, and has a likely 2HKO with Rock Slide or Brick Break on Walrein with a Choice Band set, same for Return on Gligar, which are the 3 main physical walls used in UU. The Swords Dancer also has the ability to set up on almost anything in a UU team, and Solrock can't come out to try and abuse your weakness to Rock due to the threat of Hidden Power Bug.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>It's just a shame Pinsir doesn't get Counter anymore. Oh well, Revenge is partial compensation for that. Bulk Up is a decent alternative to Swords Dance. You could try a Rest + Sleep Talk set, because Earthquake and Hidden Power Bug covers most everything but Gligar that's seen on most teams, and Pinsir has a lot of durability. Double-Edge can be used over Return in case Gligar gets really defensive.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll want an Adamant nature most of the time, but sometimes, Jolly can get you just enough Speed to put you above foes like Kangaskhan and enemy Gligar.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fearow can come in on Earthquake or Hidden Power Bug and OHKO with Choice Band Drill Peck. Golem has high defenses and STAB Rock Slide to take Pinsir out. Ninetales, Magmar, and Rapidash resist Hidden Power Bug and have STAB on Flamethrower, but Earthquake or Rock Slide will spell their end. Gligar can take on any Pinsir save those with Choice Band Return, and even then has a chance to win, depending on who's faster. Be sure to carry a Quick Attacker / Mach Puncher, however, or the Flailing Pinsir will sweep you, unless you have Misdreavus, or if a Pokemon you have can counter the specific set Pinsir runs. Aggron and Golem can do this for Hidden Power Bug Flailers and Solrock works well against Pinsir that run Earthquake as their secondary offensive move.</p>",

Most of Pinsir's counters will 2HKO it, so the damage from their hit will usually put Pinsir into Salac range, so that's a decent item, even without Endure, but Leftovers gives more longevity.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Focus Punch here is good to predict switches to Pokemon like Walrein and Kangaskhan, as it's a guaranteed OHKO on Kangaskhan, and Walrein needs max Defense, Bold, and near max HP to even have a chance to survive.

If you have Substitute, you can use that to block status, but you can't switch it in to any attack, and it can be harder to pull off a Swords Dance. Flail will seriously hurt things when you are at 1%, and then you have a choice between Earthquake and Hidden Power Bug. Hidden Power Bug hits Solrock and Lunatone, but Earthquake hits Golem, Aggron, and Omastar.

  "Lapras": {"sets": {"Offensive Utility": {}, "Curse": {}}},
  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>Omastar is widely regarded as one of the best Pokemon in UU due to its excellent defensive and offensive qualities. Omastar's access to Spikes is incredibly important for virtually every playstyle, and it finds itself to be the easiest Spikes setter to fit on teams due to its great Defense and decent defensive typing in Water / Rock, which gives it useful resistances to Flying- and especially Normal-type moves; these traits also make it one of the best leads in the metagame and a solid check to powerful Pokemon like Scyther, Fearow, and Kangaskhan. Additionally, Omastar's sky-high Special Attack prevents it from being completely passive when running defensive sets, threatening most of the Pokemon it checks with a strong, STAB-boosted Surf, and allows it to become an extremely deadly rain sweeper when paired with Swift Swim that can completely decimate teams once its checks have been taken down. However, while Water / Rock does provide some handy resistances, it also gives Omastar very common weaknesses to Grass-, Electric-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves, making it more difficult for it to consistently check Pokemon like Choice Band Granbull and Kangaskhan and lessening its effectiveness as a check to Fire-types like Ninetales, since they often run Grass-type coverage. Omastar also suffers from poor special bulk, meaning strong neutral or super effective special attacks will often severely cripple or outright KO it. Omastar's lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to status don't help it either, since Leftovers can instantly be negated by poison or burn and offensive sets detest being paralyzed due to their reliance on outspeeding foes. Omastar is also extremely slow without Swift Swim, so it often must take a hit before it can do anything.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Electric may 3HKO Tentacruel depending on the set Omastar is running and lets it deter Tentacruel without having to worry about Hydro Pump's unreliable accuracy. However, using Hidden Power Electric over Hidden Power Grass leaves Omastar vulnerable to Lanturn and Quagsire. RestTalk improves Omastar's longevity and also prevents it from being worn down by status, but it makes Omastar more passive and leaves it setup fodder for Pokemon like Slowking.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop are able to remove Spikes from their side of the field and deal with Omastar in their own ways. Tentacruel is a fantastic counter to Omastar in general, since it has great special bulk, resists both Water-type STAB move options and Ice Beam, is neutral to Hidden Power Grass, is immune to Toxic, and can 2HKO Omastar with Hydro Pump or OHKO it with Giga Drain. While Hitmontop is the least effective of the Rapid Spin users and does not resist Omastar's attacks, it can inflict poison to Omastar with Toxic and wear it down with Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Walrein, Lanturn, and Slowking are 3HKOed at best by Hidden Power Grass and are able to take down Omastar with their STAB moves or through other methods. Walrein can 3HKO it with Surf or inflict it with Toxic. Lanturn can paralyze Omastar with Thunder Wave and has a STAB in Thunderbolt to OHKO Omastar. Slowking can easily tank a Hidden Power Grass before a Calm Mind boost, use Omastar as setup fodder, and OHKO it at +2. If Omastar does not have Hidden Power Grass, Quagsire, although fairly uncommon, can completely wall it and threaten to 3HKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Due to Omastar's 4x weakness to Grass, Grass-types such as Vileplume and Meganium pose a massive threat to it; the former also threatens to immobilize Omastar with Sleep Powder. However, these Pokemon are weak to Ice Beam, so they aren't always reliable answers.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Electabuzz, Manectric, and Electrode are all very fast and threaten to OHKO Omastar with their super effective STAB moves, which make them huge problems. However, these Pokemon are all frail and would never want to take a STAB Hydro Pump from Rain Dance Omastar.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments</strong>: Poison and burn will instantly negate Leftovers recovery and quickly wear down Omastar due to its lack of reliable recovery. Rain Dance Omastar strongly detests being paralyzed, since that means that even under rain it will fail to outspeed many threats, most notably Electric-types like Electabuzz.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: While special walls such as Hypno and Kangaskhan still take a large chunk of damage from a rain- and STAB-boosted Hydro Pump, they are still able to stall out Rain Dance turns and Hydro Pump PP with Wish and Protect. Hypno and Kangaskhan don't fear anything from offensive and defensive Spikes sets apart from Thief and Toxic, and they can inflict Omastar with Toxic of their own to take it down. However, they do not do much to prevent Spikes from being set up.</p>",

      "Defensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes is an incredibly powerful support tool, since it wears down grounded foes every time they switch in, limiting their opportunities while also making it easier for Omastar's teammates to take down bulkier threats. STAB Surf lets Omastar take down Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Ninetales, Gligar, and Lunatone. Toxic cripples and stacks offensive pressure on most Pokemon that try to switch into Omastar, which gives it more opportunities to set Spikes. Protect helps Omastar rack up Toxic damage, gives it a turn of free Leftovers recovery, and allows it to scout for super effective attacks. Hidden Power Grass is an option to threaten an OHKO on opposing Omastar while also hitting other Water-types like Blastoise, Lanturn, and Quagsire. Another option is Ice Beam to take down Scyther and Altaria, which could become dangerous if not taken care of, and prevent Grass-types like Vileplume from freely switching in.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature let Omastar take multiple Earthquakes from Kangaskhan lacking Choice Band and use it as setup fodder for Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Omastar's lack of reliable recovery, it has to worry about being worn down by Spikes and status, especially poison. Thus, Rapid Spin users like Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop are useful teammates. In particular, Tentacruel's resistance to Water, neutrality to Grass-type moves, and immunity to Toxic are very helpful. Moreover, clerics such as Granbull and Vileplume make for great allies. Specifically, Granbull has Intimidate to weaken physical attackers and Thunder Wave to slow down fast Pokemon, and Vileplume has useful resistances to Water, Grass, Electric, and Fighting as well as Sleep Powder to immobilize critical threats. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Banette can block Rapid Spin to keep Omastar's Spikes from being removed, making them useful partners. Grass- and Electric-types like Vileplume and Electabuzz are very dangerous to Omastar, so Pokemon that can check them such as Muk, Cradily, and Camerupt are good choices for their defensive synergy. Wish passers such as Hypno and Kangaskhan are very helpful to increase Omastar's longevity, due to its aforementioned lack of reliable recovery. They can also make use of Protect and Toxic to rapidly wear down foes in combination with Omastar's Spikes. Hypno is an especially synergistic teammate due to its resistance to Fighting-type moves and good special bulk. Lastly, strong attackers such as Scyther and Kangaskhan greatly appreciate Spikes support, since it wears down several common checks and counters and makes bulkier threats much easier to take down.</p>"

      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Spikes wears down grounded Pokemon when they switch in, limiting foes' opportunities and making bulky Pokemon easier to defeat. Surf is the STAB move of choice due to its higher accuracy and PP over Hydro Pump. Ice Beam takes down Pokemon like Scyther and Altaria as well as Grass-types such as Vileplume, Meganium, and Shiftry. Thief is Omastar's only way of doing anything significant to one of its strongest counters, Tentacruel, taking away its Leftovers and leaving it much more prone to being worn down by Spikes and chip damage. Hidden Power Grass allows Omastar to OHKO opposing Omastar leads and prevents it from being walled by Quagsire.</p> <p>Maximum HP investment and 12 Defense EVs make Omastar as bulky as possible without sacrificing speed and power. 28 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature guarantee an OHKO with Hidden Power Grass against opposing Omastar leads, which is a critical matchup to win. 216 Speed EVs let Omastar outspeed uninvested base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Meganium.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is one of the best leads for offensive teams due to its combination of good defenses and high power, which let it win the mirror matchup, prevent it from being passive, and allow it to fire off hard hits to weaken threats for its teammates. Since this set should primarily be used on offensive teams, Pokemon that appreciate Omastar's ability to easily set up Spikes early-game such as Electabuzz, Nidoking, and Scyther are excellent partners, as it turns many 3HKOs into 2HKOs, notably giving Nidoking a chance to win against Walrein after two layers of Spikes. Omastar's team needs Spikes to stay up as long as possible, so Rapid Spin users such as Blastoise, Hitmontop, and especially Tentacruel are very problematic. Electric-types such as Electabuzz and Manectric can threaten Blastoise and Tentacruel for Omastar with their super effective STAB moves; Kangaskhan also makes a very good answer to Tentacruel, since it usually runs Earthquake. Meanwhile, Psychic-types such as Hypno and Lunatone can check Hitmontop, as they can tank Brick Break and Hidden Power Ghost and put it down with Psychic. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Banette are also useful partners, but due to their mediocre-at-best bulk, they have to watch out for STAB Hydro Pump from Tentacruel and Hidden Power Ghost from Hitmontop.</p>"
      },
      "Rain Dance Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rain Dance activates Swift Swim, letting Omastar outpace the entire unboosted metagame, and makes Hydro Pump an incredibly powerful STAB move that can do good damage even to some Pokemon that resist it. Hydro Pump is preferred over Surf on this set due to its significantly higher power, allowing Omastar to grab many KOs more easily at the cost of lower PP and unreliable accuracy. Ice Beam threatens to KO Flying-types like Fearow, Altaria, and Scyther and Grass-types like Vileplume and Meganium. Hidden Power Grass makes Omastar a more consistent sweeper, preventing it from being defenseless against Quagsire and giving it a better matchup against other Water-types like Blastoise. Although using Spikes over Hidden Power Grass can make Omastar a less effective sweeper, it is still an excellent tool to ease sweeping for Omastar's team and can lull the opponent into a false sense of security about its moveset.</p> <p>Mystic Water raises the power of Hydro Pump and allows Omastar to OHKO Pokemon like Hypno and Cradily under rain if three layers of Spikes have been set up. Instead of opting for the power of Mystic Water, Omastar can use Leftovers to increase its longevity. Lum Berry prevents Omastar from being crippled by poison, burn, and especially paralysis, which ensures that Omastar always outspeeds the entire metagame under rain.</p> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Modest nature is chosen to maximize the power of Omastar's attacks and let it outspeed the entire metagame under rain. Omastar can run as low as 96 Speed EVs to invest into defenses, which would let Omastar survive a Hidden Power Grass from Walrein and still allows it to outspeed Scyther and most Electric-types under rain, although this leaves Omastar more vulnerable outside of rain, since Pokemon like Lunatone will be able to outspeed it and hit it with Psychic or Hypnosis, and also means that it will be unable to outrun Electrode under rain, which can threaten to OHKO it with STAB Thunderbolt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite Omastar's high damage output under rain, it is walled by bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Walrein, and Lanturn, so Electric-types like Electabuzz and Manectric and Grass-types like Vileplume make for good teammates. Vileplume is notable in that it has access to Aromatherapy, which helps offset Omastar's vulnerability to status, particularly Thunder Wave. Baton Passing Calm Mind boosts is very helpful for Omastar, making its already powerful attacks even stronger and helping it tank special attacks; therefore, Hypno and Lunatone can be valuable partners. Hypno notably has good special bulk, resists Fighting-type moves, and has access to Wish to alleviate Omastar's lack of reliable recovery, although Wish and Baton Pass cannot be used together. Choice Band Nidoking and other Ground-types with Choice Band also make for good teammates, since the bulky Water-types that can stop Omastar from sweeping will be significantly weakened if they are forced to take a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake. These Ground-types can also serve as pivots for Electric-type attacks aimed at Omastar.</p>"

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>Kabutops is a threat in UU matches.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giga Drain can be used to attack Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types on the switch in case they are resistant to one of your physical attacks, most notably Quagsire. Thief can be useful for stealing items, such as Choice Band and Leftovers, to help make life hard for your opponents, but Knock Off is the superior option. Confuse Ray can give you a bit more time to sweep. Body Slam has the chance to paralyze the target, which can also be useful.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Kabutops need a Speed stat of at least 264 for the Endure set. Rain Dance Kabutops only needs 8 Speed EVs to get it at 198. Swords Dance versions might want to get the maximum amount of Speed Kabutops can get. Maximum Attack is always good on Kabutops as well. Don't use a nature that lowers Kabutop's Special Attack if you plan on using a special attack, since its Special Attack is already below-average. If you're using Substitute with Flail, make sure your HP is not divisible by 4 so you are able to Substitute four times and maximize Flail's power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Golem, Solrock, and Aggron counter most of Kabutops's sets because of their high Defense. but they are all weak to Surf. Kabutops cannot really hit Meganium and KO it quickly, so Meganium can Counter an attack back or KO it outright. Blastoise has good defensive stats, and because it is a Water-type, Kabutops cannot get around its Defense without being hit hard by it. Hypno can wall Kabutops fairly well because of Wish, Reflect, and its ability to status Kabutops. However, if Kabutops removes Hypno's Leftovers with Knock Off, it has a chance to put a dent in Hypno. Quagsire and Whiscash counter Kabutops in the same way Swampert does: they resist its Rock-type attacks and have decent Defense while packing a STAB Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance + Flail": {"description": "<p>This set allows Kabutops to utilize Flail. This can work in UU, but be mindful of Quick Attack users, since combos like Endure + Flail are common in UU. 176 Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature is all that is needed, since it would reach a Speed stat of 396 after consuming its Salac Berry.</p>"},
      "Knock Off": {"description": "<p>Knock Off makes Kabutops very annoying and can really help out your team. This set has its uses in UU, since it means that Pokemon like Hypno have to recover more and Pokemon like Fearow that may run Choice Band cannot sweep as effectively.</p>"},
      "Rain Dance Sweeper": {"description": "<p>This set is very straightforward and can definitely work in UU, since Swift Swim users can be fairly potent. Use Rain Dance to double your Speed and Swords Dance to make your attacks much stronger. You don't necessarily have to use Surf, but it is a good idea. If you don't want to, use an Adamant nature and put the Special Attack EVs into Speed. Surf is useful, though, for beating things like Solrock, since it and other similar Pokemon don't take as much damage from Rock Slide. Lum Berry is a good item choice so that your sweep isn't ruined by paralysis or burn.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>This set can be useful with some prediction, since Kabutops has above-average Attack. The lack of Earthquake as a move choice, though, really hinders Kabutops's ability to sweep. Double-Edge has a high damage output, but Return works if you don't like recoil damage. Rock Slide is a good move in general and a good STAB attack to have. Hidden Power Ground can hit Steel-types. It's a toss-up between Brick Break and Knock Off; Brick Break can hit Normal-types much harder, while Knock Off is good for a hit-and-run and generally annoying.</p>"}
    }
  },
  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>With its high HP and good Special Defense, Lanturn is a viable Electric Pokemon counter. Lanturn is also really annoying to kill in general, especially in UU matches. Volt Absorb repeatedly zaps it back to high health, and it keeps on dishing out status and some damage. Definitely worth trying.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is cool because it can make over 101 HP Substitutes. Ice Beam is a decent option on any set, but only really for Flygon in standard (and of course it is in the uber set). Salamence gets wrecked by Thunder Wave, if Lanturn is not wrecked by Earthquake beforehand. Also, Toxic is a great option in the Underused environment due to the absence of viable Heal Bellers and Aromatherapists.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Lanturn's HP is plentiful enough; it gains better defensive capabilities if you stack its defenses. 404 HP is required if you use Substitute; 401 will do otherwise. Usually it doesn't need Defense since it's mostly a special wall, so focus on Special Defense. It is desperate for Special Attack EVs for hurting anything. Use Calm or Modest nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Quagsire, due to Water Absorb and Electric immunity. Light Screen Meganium will outstall Lanturn even it has Ice Beam. You can stall Lanturn out with another Lanturn. Grumpig can switch in and setup quite easily. Hypno walls Lanturn decently as well. Toxic messes up all of these, which is why Vileplume is also viable as a counter.</p>",
    "sets": {"RestTalk": {"description": "<p>This version of Lanturn can absorb any status from any Water, and dish attacks right back at it. With its great defensive capabilities, many special attackers will be stopped cold, and will become paralyzed in the process.</p>"}, "Parafusion": {"description": "<p>Double STAB and paralysis + confusion--Lanturn is one annoying Pokemon if used correctly. Lanturn's defensive capabilities extend beyond its ability to annoy, as its high HP coupled with its almost unique resistance to the popular Thunderbolt / Ice Beam combination make it a formidable special wall. Lanturn's ability to own Electrics, Waters, and Ice-types, and spread status all around an opponent's team, make it a strong team player.</p>"}}
  },
  "Xatu": {
    "overview": "<p>Xatu's main problem is that its typing gives it a weakness to Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Rock Slide, and it doesn't resist Normal. It does have that great 4x Fighting resist and Earthquake immunity, but since most Pokemon with either of these moves will also have at least one of Rock Slide, Shadow Ball, Return, or Hidden Power Ghost, Xatu can't even abuse its resistances to switch in, unless the enemy has a Choice Band.</p> <p>Grumpig or Hypno are usually a better choice if you want a supporter, Gligar takes on Pokemon that carry Fighting moves better, and Hypno is infinitely better at support. Xatu is simply outclassed by so many Pokemon, it's rarely worth the effort. At least it can come in on Choice Band Earthquakes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Water is an option for Tyranitar in OU, and Hidden Power Fire hits Metagross and Skarmory. Xatu resists Fighting x4, so if you give it Quick Attack, it can be a Reversal counter. Xatu's Attack isn't much worse than its Special Attack, so you could try out physical attacks on it, but then you're just a worse Fearow except for your Fighting resist. Xatu can use Hidden Power Ice to get a surprise OHKO on Gligar, something Hypno and Grumpig can't do without taking a Swords Danced hit, and Gligar might expect Ice Punch from them and switch out, anyway.</p> <p>Rest can be used with the Trait Early Bird to make Rest last a single turn, or you can use it with Synchronize to switch into status, Synchronize it, and then Rest off the status later, and when you wake up, Xatu can Synchronize someone else. This is probably best done with a Sleep Talk set, however, so Xatu isn't completely a sitting duck while it's Sleeping. Thunder Wave or Toxic can be added on as status.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Xatu should go to 310 Speed max, as that will make Xatu faster than neutral nature Scyther, Electabuzz, and Manectric, as well as Jolly Kangaskhan and Timid Pikachu; this requires 224 Speed EVs and a +Speed nature. 301 Speed makes it faster than Jolly Hitmonlee, Adamant Fearow, and neutral nature Tentacruel, as well as Jolly Gligar; this requires 192 EVs and a +Speed nature. 280 Speed beats Adamant Kangaskhan and Modest Pikachu; Xatu needs 216 EVs and a neutral nature to reach this. The lowest most Xatu should go is probably 270 Speed, to beat Adamant Gligar; this needs 176 EVs and a neutral nature.</p> <p>Supporter Xatu should max HP, and put the rest in Special Attack, whereas sweeper Xatu should do the opposite--max Special Attack, and put the rest in HP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>OU counters: Snorlax, Regice, and Blissey will easily stop any special set, and won't take enough damage from a physical hit if you try and run a Choice Band Xatu for the surprise factor to make it worth it. Xatu can potentially use Wish and Calm Mind to actually beat Blissey, unless it has Toxic, or can Calm Mind itself, but even Thunder Wave will ruin Xatu's chance at a sweep when they just bring in a physical attacker and OHKO you. Tyranitar and Metagross laugh at anything Xatu can throw at them, except Dragon Dancing Tyranitar won't like Thunder Wave. Raikou, Zapdos, and other Electric Pokemon can do more damage than Xatu can defend against with Calm Mind and Wish. Any physical attacker that isn't weak to Psychic can put the hurt on Xatu, really.</p> <p>UU counters: Manectric, Electabuzz, and other Electrics can damage Xatu too fast, just like in OU. Solrock and Lunatone laugh at anything Xatu can throw at it, save Hidden Power Dark, and even that won't do enough to counter Solrock's Rock Slide or Shadow Ball. Aggron doesn't care about Thunder Wave that much, resists Psychic and Hidden Power Dark, and has STAB Rock Slide to annihilate Xatu. Sableye is immune to Psychic and can hit Xatu hard with STAB Shadow Ball or Feint Attack. Banette OHKOs Xatu with Shadow Ball, but doesn't have the Special Defense to switch in that often. Kangaskhan takes very little from Xatu's attacks, and can just beat it down with STAB Return or Shadow Ball, and, if it is abusing Early Bird Rest, you can't even cripple it with Thunder Wave. Hypno and Grumpig can just come in and Calm Mind up with you, and they will win the Calm Mind war most of the time, especially if they have Ice Punch or Thunder Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>This is mostly inferior to Celebi in OU, and Hypno / Lunatone outclass it in UU, except that it can also pass Wish. This lets you have Xatu absorb a hit as it passes out to a weakened Pokemon, letting that Pokemon take no damage as it receives the Wish. Unfortunately, Xatu has neither the defenses nor the typing to pull this off effectively.</p> <p>If you are Quiet, you'll likely want to reduce your Speed IVs to 0, so that Xatu is more likely to take the hit than whatever you're passing to.</p>"},

  "Politoed": {
    "overview": "<p>A really funny UU Pokemon. It heals by switching in on Blastoise and pals. It is a cool guy and deserves more use overall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic might beat the occasional Hitmonlee and Poliwrath or something. Swagger and Toxic are there because if you want to be \"annoying\", you might as well use them.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>The EVs mentioned with the moveset is close to pretty much the best you will get. With maximum HP, it can deal the most Counter damage possible, and that gives it enough Speed to hit 201 which is a good Speed to aim for whenever you are around that area. The rest could be stuck in Special Attack or Defense, but Special Attack seems like the wiser choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fellow Water-types such as Lanturn, and Mantine and Sleep Talk Walrein with Toxic or Hidden Power Grass, can take most anything from Politoed, including its own Hidden Power Grass. Lanturn even boasts a STAB Thunderbolt of its own with which to destroy Politoed quickly. Swords Dance Tentacruel uses its high Special Defense to set up extremely easily on Politoed and proceeds to sweep. The standard special walls of Hypno and Grumpig counter Politoed excellently as well; Hypno's Insomnia also nullifies one of Politoed's main selling points, Hypnosis. Meganium, Vileplume, and Bellossom have high Special Defense and recovery moves in Synthesis and Moonlight, and hit with Grass STAB. Banette boasts a very powerful Shadow Ball and immunity to Counter due to its Ghost typing. Electrics such as Electabuzz and Manectric make short work of Politoed.</p>",

Hypnosis is a fun status move and in UU, pretty much everything but Hypno, Banette, and the rare Sleep Talking Lanturn will be put to sleep by this guy.

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowking is one of UU's premier Calm Mind sweepers and bulky Water-types. Slowking can be immediately threatening even with a single boost thanks to its nearly unresisted dual STAB combination. Its huge bulk allows for ample setup opportunities against the tier's numerous Water- and Ground-types such as Omastar, Tentacruel, and Gligar, with most special coverage options bouncing off of it. This is complemented nicely by Rest, which allows Slowking to continue its sweep and remain threatening for the long haul. Slowking can be very hard to KO without enough offensive pressure, allowing it to easily punish most bulky builds that aim to take the game slower, and it is a great fit on bulky balance and offense teams that can open up opportunities for Slowking to wreak havoc.</p> <p>Despite its great bulk and defensive typing, Slowking is very slow and can get easily overwhelmed by offensive pressure and forced into using Rest early, something further compounded by Spikes, which makes it difficult for it to switch in. Slowking's reliance on Rest for recovery is exploitable through lost momentum, especially by sweepers that can win the game on the spot, such as Swords Dance Scyther. Slowking is also very susceptible to critical hits, as only one can put it out of commission as it's getting pressured because it has a hard time finding another opportunity to use Rest.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave is useful for turning the tides on switch-ins like Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Electabuzz and allows for earlier opportunities to set up or use Rest. Dropping Psychic for Thunder Wave is useful on paralysis spam structures, though dropping Psychic will hurt Slowking's ability to hit other Water-types and Vileplume. Dropping Rest for Thunder Wave is situationally useful on hyper offensive structures where Slowking's bulky setup sweeper nature trades longevity for speed control, but it then loses out on crucial recovery to sustain itself through its sweep. A Psychic + Calm Mind + RestTalk set reduces Slowking's coverage, but it allows Slowking to maintain itself as an offensive threat while asleep and boost more freely without losing any momentum.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Offensive variants of Kangaskhan can muscle through Slowking's physical bulk and prevent it from Rest looping with Double-Edge being a 3HKO. Specially defensive variants also work well in a pinch, forcing Slowking into a bad spot with Toxic and having reliable ways to recover off the damage Slowking deals with Wish and Early Bird Rest. Roar variants of Kangaskhan can hard stop Slowking's sweep, forcing it out of its Calm Mind boosts. However, Slowking can take advantage of Kangaskhan's Rest turns by setting up and hitting back hard with a boosted Surf.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Scyther and Pinsir pose a dangerous threat to Slowking, smashing through it with super effective STAB moves. Choice Band Scyther has a lot of immediate power with Hidden Power Bug or Silver Wind, KOing even from 60% and potentially OHKOing in Swarm range. Although Swords Dance Scyther and non-Adamant Pinsir need to set up to 2HKO Slowking, they can use Slowking's Rest turns to boost and threaten to sweep. Both Pokemon can hit Slowking very hard, but they get hit hard in return if they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Ampharos, Lanturn, and Electabuzz are great at handling Slowking, since their STAB Thunderbolts are mostly unperturbed by Special Defense boosts and prevent Slowking from Rest looping. However, if they have taken prior chip damage, Slowking can occasionally take the trade to KO them after Calm Mind, and the faster Electric-types have trouble directly switching into its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Pokemon with Roar such as Altaria, Walrein, Blastoise, and occasionally Kangaskhan can tank any boosted attacks and force Slowking out, making Slowking start back at square one on its sweep and potentially forcing it to switch in with Spikes up. If Slowking is low without using Rest, it's very hard to find an opportunity to recover and Slowking's team becomes on the back foot. However, some of these Pokemon usually don't make much progress of their own on Slowking one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore users like Walrein, Cacturne, Mr. Mime, and Raichu can lock Slowking into Calm Mind, hard stopping its sweep and preventing it from healing off damage while they use the free turns to pressure its team. Some of these Pokemon need a read on Calm Mind, as they don't comfortably switch into Slowking's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: An Explosion user such as Solrock, Electrode, Muk, or Glalie can stop Slowking's sweep by trading with it. This often opens up a gateway for a Slowking-weak Pokemon like Arcanine or Gligar to safely clean.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slowking should find opportunities to safely come in mid-game and set up Calm Mind on Pokemon such as Omastar, Tentacruel, Gligar, Arcanine, and non-Encore or Roar Walrein through passive entry points or double switches, though Slowking should be careful of the occasional Thief from some of these Pokemon. Its naturally high special bulk coupled with greatly invested physical bulk and a lack of common physical weaknesses means Slowking can survive numerous uses of STAB Earthquake, Hidden Power Electric, and Hidden Power Grass thrown its way, with the latter two doing little damage at +1 Special Defense. Psychic allows Slowking to hit Water- and Grass-types such as Tentacruel and Vileplume. Rest gives Slowking longevity to keep sweeping the opposing team and to offset the damage it takes from a multitude of attacks, Spikes, and Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes are the bane of Slowking, so a Rapid Spin user such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, or Hitmontop is mandatory with it, allowing for safer switches on Pokemon like Gligar and Arcanine. A cleric such as Ampharos, Vileplume, or Altaria can wake up Slowking after it uses Rest, letting it hit the field again for another Calm Mind-boosted assault. Kangaskhan provides the team another special sponge for opposing Water- and Electric-types, and it can pass a Wish to Slowking to keep it healthy when needing to switch into certain threats with Spikes up or if it took prior chip damage. Since Choice Band Scyther is an immediate threat to Slowking, Pokemon that can check it such as Granbull, Arcanine, and Gligar are good partners, establishing their own offense that complements Slowking by cleaning up late-game. Pokemon that can check Electric-types such as Kangaskhan, Ampharos, Cradily, and Nidoqueen can passively damage or wallbreak through them to enable Slowking to sweep and be not as easily forced out.</p>"

  "Misdreavus": {
    "overview": "<p>Misdreavus is ADV UU's most defining spinblocker and a key defensive pivot, functioning as the linchpin of many offensive and defensive Spikes stacking teams alike. Its coveted Ghost typing accompanied by Levitate give it a very valuable defensive niche by being immune to Spikes and checking physical attackers such as Gligar and Scyther, as well as Kangaskhan, Granbull, and Nidoqueen lacking Shadow Ball. Its good base Special Defense also lets it check Tentacruel and Blastoise to spinblock them more reliably than the other Ghost-types, Haunter and Sableye. Misdreavus also provides other methods of defensive support with tools like Thunder Wave, Pain Split, and Perish Song, which makes it a solid stopgap to most forms of offense.</p> <p>However, Misdreavus's defensive capabilities are also met with having issues with passivity. Its main way of dealing damage comes from relying on Spikes, Toxic, and hitting super effectively, as its neutral damage is very pitiful. Misdreavus also struggles at taking hits from stronger opponents that hit it neutrally due to its low base HP, which harms its matchups against Pokemon like Arcanine and Solrock. It also means untimely critical hits are annoying as Misdreavus tries to wall Tentacruel and Blastoise. While Misdreavus can situationally check Kangaskhan by virtue of PP stalling, the matchup is flipped if Kangaskhan is running Shadow Ball, and the same applies to other Pokemon Misdreavus would like to consistently check such as Granbull and Nidoqueen, forcing it to scout their coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Misdreavus can run Mean Look and Perish Song over its standard attacks as a surprise way to make progress by removing bulky targets that cannot threaten it such as Kangaskhan without Shadow Ball that would otherwise think it wins through walling Misdreavus. Protect can also be ran over a status move on this set to guard itself against stray attacks while the Perish Song counter goes down and gain more Leftovers recovery. Misdreavus can run an Imprison-focused set with Imprison, Shadow Ball, Toxic, and Rest to be able to stonewall every Kangaskhan variant once it sets up Imprison, denying Kangaskhan from using Rest to cure itself from Toxic. This also applies to other Pokemon Misdreavus can wall that rely on Shadow Ball to hit it such as Granbull and Nidoqueen. However, this set isn't foolproof to beat Kangaskhan, as it still doesn't like switching into Shadow Ball, and it gets outsped by Jolly variants before it can use Imprison. Additionally, its good matchup into Kangaskhan is offset by its terrible matchups into everything else, including Scyther and Gligar, as well as foes it is meant to spinblock. Misdreavus can go the offensive route with a Substitute + Calm Mind set to avoid being statused by Kangaskhan's Toxic and using it as setup fodder, but Misdreavus's damage is still extremely weak, even with boosts, compared to other Calm Mind sweepers and is less consistent than standard defensive sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Despite its immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type moves and resilience against Toxic when backed by cleric support, Misdreavus has issues into Shadow Ball variants of Kangaskhan that hit it meaningfully, forcing it into a defensive position while it struggles to break Kangaskhan by itself. Misdreavus also is extremely vulnerable to SubPunch Kangaskhan, as it can't rely on walling Kangaskhan with status and Pain Split and can't break Kangaskhan's Substitute in one hit, letting Kangaskhan freely pressure it back with a strong Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ampharos</strong>: Ampharos isn't damaged meaningfully by Misdreavus while also being able to cure itself and its teammates from status Misdreavus throws out with Heal Bell, and it can retaliate with a strong Thunderbolt that can break past a potential Rest cycle.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-type Coverage</strong>: While Misdreavus can wall certain physical attackers, some of them can use Ghost-type coverage for Misdreavus that can pressure it in the forms of Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Ghost. Kangaskhan, Granbull, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Hitmontop, Hitmonlee, and certain Swords Dance Tentacruel variants are all able to threaten Misdreavus and prevent it from walling them if they run Ghost-type coverage moves. This is especially important for Hitmontop, which Misdreavus would be able to consistently spinblock otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Users</strong>: Without Perish Song, Misdreavus struggles against Calm Mind users even when it can hit them super effectively. They can also be apt at dodging status, as Slowking and Xatu use Rest, Grumpig and Lunatone can run Substitute, and Golduck can run Lum Berry. After the Calm Mind users have had opportunities to boost, Misdreavus struggles to take their hits and deal any meaningful damage back.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attacks</strong>: Although Misdreavus is formidable at taking weaker special attacks from the likes of Tentacruel and Blastoise, it struggles to take stronger hits that can overwhelm it quickly from the likes of Arcanine, Rain Dance Omastar, and offensive Lapras.</p>",

      "Defensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With a defensive set, Misdreavus does well at taking hits from and pestering common offensive Pokemon, such as Scyther and Gligar, as well as Rapid Spin users like Tentacruel to keep Spikes on the opposing side of the field. Since Misdreavus tends to check Pokemon that are Spikes-immune, it can force Spikes damage onto many of its switch-ins.</p> <p>Thunderbolt and Psychic are relatively interchangeable, as both can hit Tentacruel, and Hidden Power Ice is needed if Misdreavus is used to check Gligar. Thunderbolt is Misdreavus's strongest neutral attack with PP advantages over Psychic in longer battles, and it allows Misdreavus to provide more immediate damage onto bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Omastar, and Feraligatr. Thunderbolt is also able to threaten Scyther with a 2HKO, which avoids putting it in Swarm range unlike Hidden Power Ice and is safer against Swords Dance variants with Lum Berry or Substitute. Psychic can be used for a super effective hit into Hitmontop to apply pressure back while it is using Hidden Power Ghost, and it's Misdreavus's best move into Kangaskhan through Special Defense drops that can force it out and rack up more Spikes damage on the opposing team. However, it leaves Misdreavus unable to meaningfully damage Blastoise and has worse PP than Thunderbolt. Hidden Power Ice can OHKO Gligar and can 3HKO Altaria at minimum depending on what spread it's running. If Misdreavus doesn't need to be used as a Gligar check, Misdreavus can run both Thunderbolt and Psychic together to have better neutral coverage and threaten every spinner. Thunder Wave is used to hinder the Speed of Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Arcanine, Tentacruel, and Scyther to make them less effective at hitting Misdreavus, letting Misdreavus use Pain Split before they attack and potentially annoying them with full paralysis. Toxic can be used instead to put bulky Pokemon like Blastoise, Lanturn, and Cradily on a timer. Pain Split is a form of instant recovery and synergizes well with Misdreavus's low base HP to trade well with Kangaskhan. Rest is an alternative option to cure status while healing Misdreavus back to full health and helps in PP stall wars against Kangaskhan. Perish Song can be used alongside Hidden Power Ice to phaze bulky setup sweepers and force switches to rack up more Spikes damage.</p> <p>Maximum HP and 84 Defense EVs allow Misdreavus to live Swords Dance Scyther's +2 Hidden Power Flying from full health. The rest is put into Special Defense in order to spinblock Tentacruel better. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 140 Def / 116 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to take physical attacks like Hitmontop's Hidden Power Ghost better while still dodging a 3HKO from Tentacruel's Surf. 52 Special Attack EVs can be used to guarantee a consistent OHKO on Gligar with Hidden Power Ice, although it usually isn't worth sacrificing defensive EVs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In order for Misdreavus's team to be effective at making progress, it is best paired with Spikes that it can uphold by spinblocking common spinners. Omastar is a great candidate to set Spikes, as its massive Defense allows it multiple opportunities to come in mid-game to lay Spikes against Kangaskhan, Scyther, Solrock, and Granbull, meaning Misdreavus doesn't have to be a sole check to these Pokemon. Misdreavus is also a cornerstone of Spikes+paralysis spam teams, as its ability to keep Spikes on the field combined with Thunder Wave enables slow but dangerous wallbreakers such as Choice Band Solrock and Choice Band Golem. On these teams, Misdreavus is usually paired with Spikers such as bulky Qwilfish or Roselia, which can paralyze opponents with Thunder Wave and Stun Spore as well as providing other means of team support such as Self-Destruct and Aromatherapy. Misdreavus also pairs well with wallbreakers and late-game cleaners to provide a much-needed source of offense that takes advantage of Spikes chip on bulky foes. Pokemon like Arcanine, Feraligatr, Nidoqueen, Grumpig, and Swords Dance Tentacruel are all apt wallbreakers with Spikes that can break open holes for late-game cleaners like Choice Band Scyther to clean up.</p> <p>Since Misdreavus is worn down by status and using Rest makes it more passive, it appreciates being paired with a cleric such as Ampharos, Vileplume, and Lapras. Ampharos and Vileplume especially appreciate Misdreavus's ability to check Gligar. Defensive Kangaskhan is able to provide Misdreavus with Wish support so it isn't pressured as much to use Pain Split or Rest for recovery, and Kangaskhan can also take on special attackers that Misdreavus can't handle on its own such as Arcanine, Walrein, and bulky Electric-types such as Ampharos and Lanturn. Misdreavus can struggle against some physical wallbreakers that have coverage for it or hit it neutrally such as offensive Kangaskhan and Solrock, so physically defensive pivots such as Omastar, Granbull, and Hitmontop help against these threats. If Misdreavus isn't running Perish Song, it relies on other Pokemon to check bulky setup sweepers such as Slowking, Curse Muk, and Curse Lapras. Pokemon with Roar such as Blastoise and Lapras are phazers that pair beautifully with Misdreavus, as Roar also helps spread Spikes chip and pressures switches well.</p>"

  "Dunsparce": {
    "overview": "<p>Everyone loves Dunsparce, but no one loves to be on the receiving end of its haxing skills. I believe he is always a good choice for a UU team. He can take a fair few hits, and deal back some slow, steady damage, while the opponent can't do a thing and you restore health with Leftovers! Just don't overestimate his lifespan and be too risky... but other than that, have fun!</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quite a few options here, most of which take advantage of Serene Grace. That 20% chance of a full stat boost from Ancient Power is always good, which can potentially make Dunsparce a good Pokemon (:o indeed!) Glare can paralyze more Pokemon than Thunder Wave or Body Slam can, being able to hit both Ground- and Ghost-types, but that accuracy winds me up sometimes. Ice Beam has that 20% chance of a freeze, but I don't use it much, as Dunsparce is all about paraflinch. Water Pulse has a 40% chance of confusion, quite chancey, always up for consideration. Attract can get piss annoying, and will at least force a switch, as does Yawn, but remember it doesn't go hand in hand with paralysis. And Counter is a nice surprise; you don't see it much on this Pokemon.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>I usually max out HP, load quite a bit into Attack, and distribute the rest into its defenses. Go with Adamant. Unless, of course, you do decide to use one of those special attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>He may have a buttload of HP, but he can't really take a strong attack, least of all a Brick Break. His low Speed leaves him susceptible to status effects as well, like sleep and so forth, shutting down his whole operation. Watch out primarily for the likes of Machamp, Hariyama, Jumpluff and friends. And getting burned by Banette is never cool.</p>",
    "sets": {"Paraflinch": {"description": "<p>Dunsparce is a highly diverse Pokemon; I find it works better as a physical sweeper in a UU game. Flinching enemies constantly with Serene Grace + Headbutt is very annoying, and no Pokemon will score it more than Dunsparce, especially when a paralyzed foe is left in. Basically, use Thunder Wave (or Body Slam if you want the 60% chance of paralyzing a Ground Pokemon), maybe again if you predict a switch. Then Headbutt or Rock Slide for some major flinching!</p> <p>Shadow Ball is really only there to hit Ghosts, and with repeated Special Defense drops, it can trigger a switch later on. Rock Slide is primarily there to take out the common Jumpluff, Fearow and Swellow, but if you decide to risk using Dunsparce outside of UU, you may be able to score a KO against Skarmory... something I have managed to do with this Dunsparce many times.</p>"}}
  },
  "Gligar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gligar stands out in ADV UU as one of the best Ground-types and Swords Dance sweepers, being one of the most consistent punishers of the ubiquitous Kangaskhan's Rest. Gligar's Ground / Flying typing gives it a very good offensive and defensive profile. Many tier staples, such as Omastar, Arcanine, Tentacruel, and Ampharos, are weak to Earthquake; combine this with the fact that these Pokemon are commonly paired together, and Gligar can actively threaten a majority of team's defensive cores. Gligar separates itself from other Swords Dance users such as Scyther and Pinsir by being quite the apt physical hit-taker, not only with its good base Defense but also with its bevy of resistances and immunities as well as Hyper Cutter to block Intimidate from physical walls such as Granbull and Hitmontop.</p> <p>However, Gligar's typing is a double-edged sword, making it 4x weak to Ice-type moves from the Electric-types like Ampharos, Electrode, Electabuzz it would ideally check otherwise. Gligar's measly base Attack also means its damage can be disappointing without Swords Dance boosts or a Choice Band, having trouble pressuring bulky targets without Spikes up. This means that even when Gligar can hit a foe super effectively, it has worse potential to trade damage when their response can OHKO it back, notably in the cases of Omastar, Ampharos, and Nidoqueen. While Gligar has a Speed tier atop many Pokemon, it isn't enough for other common offensive threats that can outspeed it, such as Arcanine, Scyther, Tentacruel, and Hitmonlee, making it more easy to offensively check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Bulky EV spread using 96 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Def / 140 Spe with an Impish nature lets Gligar avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Scyther's Hidden Power Flying, which makes it better at weathering hits from physical wallbreakers. Gligar can use different secondary attack options over Hidden Power Flying, such as Rock Slide to OHKO Scyther without boosts and hit other Flying-types like Altaria, Xatu, and Fearow or Hidden Power Ghost to hit Solrock, Lunatone, and Misdreavus super effectively. Gligar's good physical bulk makes it an effective Counter user, letting it check Solrock without the need for Iron Tail and giving it a way to retaliate against offensive Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Granbull. Toxic is able to cripple Gligar's common switch-ins such as Solrock, Blastoise, and Walrein, setting them on a timer and slowly pushing them into range of Gligar's boosted attacks. Substitute can also be used alongside Toxic to stall for Toxic damage against defensive Pokemon, although this comes at the cost of limited offensive presence without Swords Dance. Rest can be used on semi-stall teams with cleric support to maintain a long-term offensive threat and shrug off status. Steel Wing can be used in place of Iron Tail for its perfect accuracy, but Iron Tail is preferred for its ability to OHKO most offensive Solrock variants at +2.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Lapras, Walrein, and Slowking are great at withstanding Gligar's attacks and OHKOing it back with Surf or Ice Beam. Even Ground-weak Water-types can withstand its weak unboosted Earthquake in the case of Omastar, outspeed it in the case of Tentacruel, or prevent its possible entry in the case of Lanturn. Water-type sweepers such as Rain Dance Omastar, Gorebyss, Feraligatr, and Golduck can also use their entry on Gligar to set up and threaten to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Most Flying-type Pokemon can check Gligar by being immune to Earthquake while shrugging off its other coverage. Altaria is one of the best Gligar checks, tanking any boosted attack from Gligar with ease and threatening it back with an Ice Beam OHKO. Xatu outspeeds Gligar and 2HKOes it with Psychic, using Reflect to tank its hits and Early Bird + Rest to heal off any damage it lands. Even though Gligar can come in on Scyther's Bug-type moves and threaten it back, it must be careful when switching into Choice Band Scyther's Hidden Power Flying or Double-Edge. While uncommon, Fearow can offensively threaten Gligar in a similar way to Choice Band Scyther with a stronger Flying-type STAB option in Drill Peck, having the benefit of not being weak to Gligar's Hidden Power Flying.</p> <p><strong>Levitate Users</strong>: Levitate users are immune to Gligar's Earthquake and can tank Gligar's other hits decently. Solrock and Lunatone both resist Hidden Power Flying while threatening Gligar with Choice Band Rock Slide or Ice Beam, respectively. However, they have to respect the possibility of Gligar running Iron Tail, which can flip these matchups. Misdreavus can survive a boosted Hidden Power Flying while OHKOing Gligar back with Hidden Power Ice. While Haunter is frailer than Misdreavus, it can outspeed Gligar and use Will-O-Wisp to take negligible damage, or it can take the simpler route of OHKOing Gligar with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon</strong>: While Gligar isn't slow, many common wallbreakers can get the Speed jump on it and take advantage of Gligar's low Special Defense in the cases of Arcanine, Tentacruel, and Electabuzz. Scyther can also use the Speed advantage to respond to Gligar with Choice Band Double-Edge or Hidden Power Flying to prevent its entry or revenge kill it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Gligar primarily takes the role of a Swords Dance sweeper that uses its good bulk to set up on physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Scyther and break through common defensive cores. Hidden Power Flying provides a secondary STAB option for Scyther while also dealing more meaningful damage to Vileplume and Hitmontop. For Gligar's last move, Quick Attack can be used for a priority option to check pinch Berry sweepers such as Reversal Scyther and Petaya Berry Electrode and Manectric, and it can pick off faster foes like Tentacruel with prior chip damage. Iron Tail is an alternative option to hit Solrock and Lunatone, which resist both of Gligar's STAB attacks. A Jolly nature allows Gligar to Speed tie with other base 85 Speed foes such as Qwilfish, Nidoking, and Pinsir, while an Adamant nature increases its general damage in conjunction with Swords Dance. 16 Special Defense EVs can be used to consistently survive Timid Arcanine's Fire Blast from full health, allowing Gligar to respond with Earthquake. Substitute can be run over Quick Attack or Iron Tail with a Salac Berry to mitigate Gligar's low Speed and pose a more dangerous sweeping threat late-game, as it isn't KOed at 25% health from all common forms of priority. With this set, Gligar's HP should be divisible by four so Salac Berry can be consumed at 25% health or after three Substitutes maximum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gligar struggles with what last move it wants to run between Quick Attack and Iron Tail, but good team support can alleviate these issues. If Gligar lacks Quick Attack, it appreciates teammates with their own priority moves for fast sweepers, such as Arcanine with Extreme Speed and Scyther with Quick Attack. If Gligar lacks Iron Tail, it likes Pokemon that are able to reliably switch into and check Solrock such as Omastar, Blastoise, and Hitmontop. The best way that Gligar can gain a Swords Dance boost is by coming in on Kangakshan's Rest, therefore, it's good to pair it with Pokemon that can lure Kangaskhan with Toxic, such as Omastar, Tentacruel, Ampharos, and Lanturn, and bulky attackers that can trade hits well with Kangaskhan, such as Arcanine, Lapras, and Walrein. Gligar heavily appreciates Spikes support to make up for its lack of power in pressuring switches, incrementally helping to push bulky foes in range of its boosted Earthquake. Omastar, Qwilfish, and Glalie are good Spikes setters to accomplish this, as they can also help against bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Walrein that Gligar can have trouble with. Omastar can use Toxic or Hidden Power Electric to chip them, while Qwilfish and Glalie can use Explosion to break open a hole in the opposing team that Gligar that can capitalize on. Having Pokemon to switch into Water-types is also helpful if Gligar is forced out, making Kangaskhan, Walrein, Lanturn, and Lapras good defensive partners. While Gligar can threaten Electric-types, all of them pose the threat of Ice-type coverage to scare it out. Therefore, Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Lanturn can help by reliably switching into them. Gligar swotching into passive Pokemon makes it vulnerable to status from Kangaskhan, Hitmontop, and Vileplume. Clerics such as Ampharos, Vileplume, Lapras, and Granbull can help with this and increase Gligar's longevity as an offensive threat.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>When holding a Choice Band, Gligar acts as a conventional wallbreaker that pressures soft checks to Ground-types such as Blastoise, Walrein, and Lapras, and its access to both Hyper Cutter and a priority move sets it apart from other Choice Band users. Hidden Power Flying is a secondary STAB option for Ground-immune Pokemon like Scyther, Misdreavus, and Altaria while hitting physically defensive Pokemon like Vileplume and Hitmontop hard as well. Iron Tail complements Gligar's STAB moves by hitting Solrock and Lunatone while also consistently 2HKOing Cradily. Finally, Quick Attack lets Gligar deal with pinch Berry sweepers such as Reversal Scyther, and it can pick off faster foes like Arcanine and Tentacruel when they're chipped. An Adamant nature maximizes Gligar's immediate damage, letting it 2HKO bulky Kangaskhan variants and OHKO offensive Solrock with Iron Tail, but a Jolly nature can be used instead to Speed tie with other base 85 Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Pinsir, and Nidoking. 16 EVs can be placed in Special Defense to consistently survive Timid Arcanine's Fire Blast from full health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Choice Band Gligar has substantial power, it appreciates Spikes support to pressure bulky targets trying to switch in. Omastar, Qwilfish, and Glalie are great Spikes setters, with Omastar providing extra defensive support against Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Solrock, and Qwilfish and Glalie using Explosion against bulky Water-types. Due to Gligar's hit-and-run nature while needing to Choice lock, it will likely be switching multiple times throughout a match and thus appreciates a good defensive backbone. Since Gligar doesn't have Leftovers to bolster its defensive utility, it appreciates Wish support from Kangaskhan to increase its longevity. If Scyther, Solrock, or opposing Gligar come in on Earthquake, Gligar appreciates physical walls like Omastar, Granbull, and Blastoise being able to switch into them. Gligar beating down bulky Water-types mid-game is appreciated by offensive Pokemon that like them weakened, such as Arcanine, Swords Dance Tentacruel, and Rain Dance Omastar.</p>"

  "Sneasel": {
    "overview": "<p>Sneasel is tied with Persian as the second fastest Pokemon in the entire metagame, which, alongside its decent base 95 Attack and unique dual typing, would allow it to perform wonderfully as a Swords Dance sweeper or Choice Band wallbreaker. Unfortunately, both of its STAB types are special, and it only has base 35 Special Attack, meaning Sneasel must use non-STAB moves if it wants to make use of its much higher Attack stat. Sneasel is also exceedingly frail and has five glaring weaknesses, necessitating an immense amount of team support in order for it to function. Even so, Sneasel has perfect neutral coverage in Shadow Ball + Brick Break, and in a metagame dominated by Psychic-types such as Hypno, Solrock, Lunatone, and Grumpig, as well as Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Cradily, and Walrein, perhaps it's not all bad for everyone's favorite icy weasel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set is more suited to revenge killing than Sneasel's Swords Dance set, making use of moves like Focus Punch and Hidden Power Flying, the latter of which is extremely useful against walls like Hitmontop, Vileplume, and Meganium that Sneasel would otherwise have trouble with. However, Sneasel faces heavy competition as a revenge killer from Persian, which gets STAB on Double-Edge, allowing it to always OHKO Hasty Tentacruel and hit Scyther significantly harder than Sneasel ever could. Substitute and Endure are both options to help Sneasel more safely bring its HP down to the activation range of its Liechi Berry. Focus Punch can be used alongside Substitute as a stronger alternative to Brick Break. Sneasel can also use Substitute in tandem with Toxic to wear down the foe. Quick Attack can be utilized as a priority move that picks off weakened Pokemon. However, Sneasel already has the necessary Speed tier to adequately perform this role, and giving up an important move for Quick Attack is not justifiable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Fighting-types such as Poliwrath, Primeape, and Hitmontop can easily OHKO Sneasel with their STAB attacks. Hitmonlee and Hitmontop also have access to Mach Punch, which ignores Sneasel's absurd Speed stat. Additionally, Hitmontop's Intimidate softens the incoming attack before Hitmontop revenge kills Sneasel with Mach Punch. Walls such as Blastoise, Hypno, Granbull, and the aforementioned Hitmontop can all pivot into Sneasel easily and 2HKO it back, especially the latter two with their access to Intimidate. Due to its extreme frailty, Sneasel gets easily crushed by Rock-types such as Omastar, Solrock, and Lunatone; burned alive by Fire-types such as Ninetales, Camerupt, and Magmar; swarmed by Bug-types such as Scyther and Pinsir; and hammered by Steel-types such as Aggron.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Shadow Ball and Brick Break combine to provide perfect neutral coverage against the entire tier, and, when boosted by Swords Dance, they clean up opposing teams quite nicely. Because Shadow Ball and Brick Break do not receive STAB, Double-Edge becomes Sneasel’s strongest attack against targets that are hit neutrally by the first two attacks. Swords Dance boosts Sneasel’s Attack stat by two stages with each use and allows it to perform the role of a setup sweeper.</p> <p>Liechi Berry is Sneasel's best option for a held item, as it is likely to take a massive hit to activate it or use Double-Edge enough to activate it through the recoil. Both of Sneasel’s abilities are relatively useless. However, Inner Focus prevents Sneasel from flinching, which is considerably more useful than prevention of lowered accuracy, especially with Fake Out users such as Persian and Shiftry around. Maximum Speed and Attack EVs allow Sneasel to outspeed the entire tier and hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature is utilized so that Sneasel can outspeed base 105 Speed Pokemon such as Scyther, Manectric, Rapidash, and Electabuzz. Sneasel is hard to use because it's so incredibly frail and cannot be directly switched into basically anything. As such, Sneasel should only be switched in via a slow Baton Pass or after a teammate has fainted so that it can revenge kill the foe. Furthermore, bulky attackers such as Kangaskhan and Lunatone can ease pressure off Sneasel with their ability to take a hit yet still maintain offensive momentum. Spikes setters such as Omastar are incredibly useful for chipping away at the opposing team for Sneasel to clean up later.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Skill Swap could be fun, and your Intimidate won't help anybody. Toxic and Hypnosis are other options for statuses that Stantler can inflict.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>Stantler needs some weird EVs, depending on his set. For the standard set you're obviously going to want some Speed and Attack, so either give it full Speed and a +Spe nature or 285, enough to outspeed Medicham and other things at that Speed. Split the rest in Attack and HP so he'll survive and get more from Leftovers. For the Calm Mind set worry more about Special Attack and Speed over everything else, maybe a little in HP too. Psych-Up set is going to need less Attack and MUCH more HP and Defense.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Anything that shrugs off or abuses status for the first set, like Heracross or Celebi. Any physical attacker owns the shit out of the Swagger / Psych Up set with some luck. Prediction counters the last set. Skarmory beats all sets except those with Thunderbolt, Gengar / Misdreavus beat you if you don't have Shadow Ball, and any Steel / Rock can shut you down, especially without Earthquake. Steelix just laughs even at Choice Band Earthquakes and counters with an Earthquake of its own, or Toxic.</p>",

It doesn't matter if you end up with 1, 2, or 3 HP, though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gligar survives an attack and can finish it off. Golem can take one Belly Drummed Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Fighting. Aggron blocks those without Hidden Power Fighting / Hidden Power Ground. Cradily can take anything but Hidden Power Fighting and hit Linoone with any attack.</p> <p>The main way to counter Linoone is to simply just keep attacking it; since it's so fragile, it won't get off its Belly Drum and thus will be countered.</p>",

Stat-wise, it has 5 more base HP and 3 more base Defense at the cost of 25 base Special Defense, and considering that the only Pokemon I'd really be switching either of them into are weakened enemy Electric- and Water-types, Special Defense is more important. In terms of movepool, Crunch is Manectric's only real advantage, whereas Electabuzz has Cross Chop, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Psychic.</p>",

Thunder Wave to help your team out a bit, but it won't be very effective considering Lanturn, Quagsire, or Meganium are going to be the most common switch-ins, Thief is a novelty option as well, but it could work in cases such as when you want to disable a Pokemon by removing their Leftovers. These options should mostly replace Crunch, because it's not going to be hitting Grumpig and the like much harder than Thunderbolt, anyway.</p> <h3>EVs</h3> <p>The EVs mentioned with the moveset allow you to get 330 Speed, which is a nice Speed to be at in UU considering that there are a lot of Pokemon in the 328-9 region. Instead of maxing Special Attack, by taking 8 EVs from it and moving it into the leftover EVs you got from setting the Speed below its maximum, you achieve a HP that is divisible by four which is very nice to activate your Petaya after 3 Substitutes instead of 4, so you might survive some random Quick Attacks, but being able to Substitute 4 times can also be useful.</p> <p>The IVs given are for Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Water should use 30 Attack, 30 Defense, and 30 Special Attack, with 31 everywhere else.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Lanturn can often eat a few Hidden Power Grasses and deal Surfs in return. Meganium takes around 2 Hidden Power Ices, and with Light Screen, even more. Quagsire can counter it only if Manectric's Hidden Power isn't Grass. Hypno and Grumpig are listed due to having a great Special Defense, and although they can't take a large amount of Crunches (especially if Special Defense drops occur), they sure won't go down without a fight.</p>",

Thunderbolt almost everything in sight, Crunch is for Pokemon such as Hypno and Grumpig that can usually wall you if you don't have a super effective attack. The choice of Hidden Power can be a tad tough though. Hidden Power Grass is so you don't get totally walled by Lanturn and Quagsire, and so you can use it on Golem. Hidden Power Ice will hit Gligar however, and now it doesn't get walled by Meganium and other Grass Pokemon. Hidden Power Water hits Gligar harder than Crunch, but not as hard as Hidden Power Ice, as well as being your best bet against Camerupt.</p>"}}

However, Sharpedo faces stiff competition from other Water-type sweepers such as Feraligatr, Swords Dance Tentacruel, and Rain Dance sweepers like Omastar and Gorebyss, as well as other Salac Berry sweepers like Scyther. Sharpedo also has a tendency to be walled by Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, Ampharos, and Blastoise due to its move choices, and it struggles to break bulkier Pokemon without heavy chip damage or Spikes and usually gets OHKOed in return because of its frailty, making it a difficult Pokemon to justify using. Rough Skin plays a big part in Sharpedo's niche in the tier, as it punishes physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Scyther by chipping them into range of its moves. Hydro Pump functions as Sharpedo's explosive STAB option, able to OHKO Solrock and Arcanine and smashing the likes of Omastar and Granbull while also being a generally powerful move to spam. Ice Beam is solid coverage for Grass-types like Vileplume and Cradily while also giving Sharpedo a more consistent way to OHKO Gligar and chunk Scyther. Crunch allows Sharpedo to handle Ghost-types such as Haunter and Misdreavus as well as beat down opposing Water-types that may wall it, such as Slowking.</p> <p>As an offensive sweeper, Sharpedo greatly appreciates any form of support it can get, such as Spikes from the likes of Omastar, Qwilfish, and Glalie as all of Sharpedo's main checks dislike Spikes damage, therefore making it easier for Sharpedo to break through them, and screens from Electrode or Solrock to aid in its sweeping potential. Electrode, Solrock, and Glalie also help Sharpedo out tremendously thanks to Explosion, being able to lure in bulky Water- and Electric-types Sharpedo can struggle to deal with such as Lanturn, Ampharos, Tentacruel, and Walrein. Teammates that can switch into the aforementioned Electric-types, such as Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Nidoqueen work well with Sharpedo, as they can also help whittle down its checks for it to sweep late-game. Toxic support from teammates such as Omastar, Arcanine, and Tentacruel helps Sharpedo in its sweeping possibilities by giving it the chance to 2HKO opponents much more safely with the additional chip damage provided. Paralysis spreaders like Stun Spore Vileplume and Thunder Wave Misdreavus can also help Sharpedo get into a position to sweep, as well as allowing it to outspeed Scyther and Tentacruel without eating its Salac Berry. Thief users, such as Electabuzz and Arcanine, also are greatly appreciated, as they are able to remove Leftovers from defensive opponents that would otherwise rely on them to keep Sharpedo in check.</p>"

With the massive EV investment in SpD, even a Zapdos with 383 SpA (the highest of any Electric-Type) only manages to do 24% - 28% with Hidden Power Ice or Grass. Timid Raikou's unboosted Crunch only hits for 23% - 25%, making Camerupt one of the best Calm Mind Raikou counters in the game. Though by far the most effective of its uses, Camerupt's walling potential is not limited to Electric-types. It switches in on Weezing with relative ease, though Sludge Bomb does take its toll. Heal Bell Celebi's Psychic only does 28% - 31%, while Fire Blast hits for 67% - 79%. While Camerupt doesn't exactly wall them, it can be used to beat Jirachi, Jynx, and Alakazam in a pinch. Wish Jirachi has only about a 1% chance of 2HKOing Camerupt with a +1 Psychic, while Camerupt has an 80.7% chance of 2HKOing Jirachi with Earthquake. Jynx and Alakazam miss out on the 2HKO and are both OHKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p>In UU, Camerupt stops, but falls short of beating, the ever popular Hypno + Vileplume combo. Sunny Day + Solar Beam users, barring nasty luck, are shut down, and Victreebel can be walled in a pinch. Ninetales, Manectric, and Electabuzz have no chance of overcoming Camerupt without Hidden Power Water.</p> <p>Rest and Sleep Talk, combined with a sandstorm immunity, gives Camerupt some much needed durability and allows it to completely wall special versions of Gengar. Letting it utilize dual STAB is an obvious choice, with Ground and Fire only being resisted by Flygon, Salamence, Gyarados, Moltres, and Charizard in OU and Mantine, Solrock, and Lunatone in UU.

Jolly can outspeed basically everything in UU except base 125 Speed Pokemon and above, but you lose the Attack power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Not many things in UU can switch into Banette, but Blastoise, Walrein, and Politoed can hold their own quite well. Meganium can also switch into it, although it can't do anything back directly. Gligar and Golem can take a few hits, but again, watch out for that burn. Muk blocks Knock Off with Sticky Hold, and has decent defenses to take Shadow Balls and Hidden Power Fightings, but unless it has Rest or manages to get up a Substitute, it won't like taking Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

Unfortunately, this can't be done often with Banette as you can see its defenses are lacking. This is more of an anti-tank Pokemon; if you want to counter sleep inducers, Hypno is probably the safer bet.</p>"},
      "Choice Band": {"description": "<p>Banette's top two attacking moves are self-explanatory. It has such a bad movepool, though, that other attacks are hard to find; even Double-Edge doesn't damage anything more than the other moves, other than the Normal / Flying types and Girafarig. Will-O-Wisp hurts them more, anyway. Hyper Beam and Destiny Bond are both suicide moves, Will-O-Wisp actually does something to physical sweepers, while Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Water-types.</p>"},
      "Salac + Destiny Bond": {"description": "<p>This set works well in UU, and it can catch things off guard. Banette is immune to Quick Attack / Mach Punch, so running Salac Berry should bring no worries. Hit / burn what you can, and then when you think your run is over, Endure and proceed to Destiny Bond that now slower sweeper or wall.</p>"}

    "overview": "<p>Absol has a good movepool and great Attack. Too bad its poor defenses and Speed stop it from being better, or it could be a complete monster. Baton Pass is still fun to toy with.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>EVs</h3> <p>You'll want to focus on Defense and HP on Baton Passing Absol. For the sweeper sets, however, you'll want Attack, and lots of it. Running 264 Speed for Salac variants helps.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Your best bet is probably Gligar, unless Absol is using a novelty Ice Beam set. What hinders Absol is that its Speed is so low that even if it could pull something off, Nidoking or Fearow could just switch in and beat it down. Pokemon like Kangaskhan can easily take a hit from the special set and 2HKO it.</p>",
    "sets": {"Swords Dance + Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>This is a Baton Passing Absol. Absol makes a great Baton Passer with Taunt and can hit stuff hard with Shadow Ball. However, you may not find Taunt to be particularly useful in UU, as very few things run Roar there, and so for this reason, you may prefer Hidden Power Fighting. It combos nicely with Shadow Ball to hit everything at least neutrally. Substitute, however, is still useful to stop status effect moves and is a lot easier on prediction than Taunt. It also blocks Explosion and goes well with Baton Pass.</p>"}}
  },
  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Glalie has a niche in the UU metagame as a Spikes lead on hyper offense teams and as a rare mid-game Spiker with Explosion on bulky offense teams. Although it faces direct competition from prominent Spikers Omastar and Qwilfish, Glalie's niche comes from its pure Ice typing giving it a defensive edge against Electric- and Ground-type attacks from offensive Normal- and Electric-types. Glalie has positive matchups against both other Spikers and Rapid Spinners, giving it good self-sufficiency for winning Spikes wars. Many of Glalie's offensive teammates appreciate the momentum that Glalie provides with the combination of Spikes and Explosion, making it a good Spiker on teams that prefer Glalie's defensive typing. However, Glalie isn't infallible, as any team with an Arcanine can quickly reverse the momentum it generates. This is what separates Glalie from Qwilfish, whose Water typing allows it to resist Arcanine's Fire Blast to safely lay down Spikes while also providing reliable speed control for its team with Thunder Wave, leaving Qwilfish as the preferred hyper offense lead in the modern metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glalie can be used as a mid-game Spiker with a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 236 SpD / 20 Spe and a Careful nature to better switch into Water- and Electric-types. Taunt can be used over Hidden Power Grass to prevent slower foes from using Toxic to put Glalie on a timer, Kangaskhan from using Wish or Rest, or slower Spikers like Omastar from setting up. Ice Beam gives Glalie a STAB option that prevents Flying-type setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scyther and Gligar from turning Glalie into setup fodder without resorting to Explosion. Icy Wind is a speed control tool to prevent Taunt users from denying Spikes or to lay more layers of Spikes against Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Electabuzz, though Qwilfish is better at speed control through Thunder Wave paralysis. Light Screen allows Glalie to survive special attacks more comfortably and set up on Omastar, Tentacruel, and Ampharos, and it can keep it active for a teammate after using Explosion. Lum Berry gives Glalie a safety net against Toxic and paralysis to let it lay more layers of Spikes without being put on a timer or losing its Speed for a fast Explosion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Arcanine hard stops Glalie from applying pressure, as it is faster than max Speed Glalie and OHKOes it with Fire Blast. Lead Arcanine can deny Glalie the opportunity to lay Spikes and pressure common switch-ins with Thief if Glalie switches out, while any non-lead Arcanine can limit Glalie to one layer of Spikes before exerting its own offense. If Glalie preemptively uses Explosion turn 1 on the Arcanine switch, this means Glalie has not laid down any Spikes, and Explosion can not OHKO Arcanine after Intimidate, keeping Arcanine healthy to receive Wish passes from Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Solrock</strong>: Solrock's Rock Slide puts a dent into Glalie; Choice Band Solrock can OHKO it, while other variants usually 2HKO it. It is also Spikes-immune, resistant to Explosion, and not easily pressured by Glalie's coverage. Solrock can even safely set up Reflect or Light Screen against non-Taunt Glalie to enable certain setup sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Hitmontop is a spinner Glalie has trouble against, as Brick Break puts the fear of a 2HKO into Glalie, while Rapid Spin removes its Spikes. Glalie can explode on Hitmontop after it has laid Spikes, but Intimidate means it will not OHKO, leaving Glalie to need prior chip damage or a revenge killer for Hitmontop. Hitmonlee is an anti-Spikes lead that can OHKO Glalie with Choice Band Brick Break, or use Bulk Up on its Spikes turn or switch-out turns.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter makes for a good anti-Spikes lead, as it can Taunt any attempts to lay Spikes and has an immunity to Explosion, leaving Glalie no other option than to switch out, or use the uncommon Ice Beam. Haunter thus makes its own progress by spreading Will-O-Wisps, Thieving any Leftovers, or using Substitute to push itself into Salac/Petaya Berry range and scout the switch-in.</p>",

      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Glalie safely sets up Spikes against Pokemon such as Omastar, Ampharos, Walrein, and Lanturn with its pure Ice typing and solid 80/80/80 bulk. Explosion breaks a hole in the opposition, severely denting anything that doesn't resist Normal or allowing Glalie's team to play a favorable 5v5. Explosion also comes in handy for removing slower setup sweepers such as Granbull, Slowking, and Curse Muk, which can otherwise outlast teams with great bulk and Rest. Earthquake puts pressure on Poison-types like Qwilfish and Tentacruel, taxing either of them for using Spikes or Rapid Spin, respectively, and allows Glalie to hit Electric-types without resorting to Explosion, breaking Electrode and Manectric's Substitutes to keep them from possibly taking advantage of Glalie. Hidden Power Grass is used to pressure Omastar, limiting the amount of Spikes it puts out while Glalie sets its own and making sure Glalie's Explosion connects on a different target that doesn't resist it.</p> <p>A Jolly nature on lead Glalie ensures it will outspeed leads such as Adamant Kangaskhan and neutral-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Nidoking. A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe with an Impish nature allows Glalie to more effectively set up Spikes against Normal-types, as it can dodge a 2HKO from offensive Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Bulk Up Granbull's unboosted Return, and an OHKO from Choice Band Granbull's Double-Edge. It also narrowly dodges an OHKO from non-Choice Band Kangaskhan and Granbull's Focus Punch while it sets up Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Electric-types like Electrode, Manectric, and Electabuzz like Glalie as a teammate, for all their checks take Spikes damage, and they appreciate Glalie's ability to safely set up and use Explosion on Kangaskhan, Ampharos, and Lanturn. Psychic-types like Xatu, Lunatone, and Grumpig love Glalie's Spikes support increasing their offensive presence. They can force switches against positive matchups by taking advantage of Psychic's Special Defense drops and few notable resistances to set up a Substitute or Calm Mind. Arcanine likes Glalie as a partner both because it likes Spikes to help it break through specially bulky walls, and Glalie can wear down Tentacruel with Earthquake as well as using Explosion on other bulky Water-types such as Walrein, Blastoise, Lanturn, and Slowking. In a similar vein, physical wallbreakers like offensive Kangaskhan, Scyther, Granbull, Solrock, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen appreciate Glalie wearing down physical walls like Omastar, Granbull, and Vileplume through Spikes, Hidden Power Grass pressure for Omastar, and Explosion to remove the latter two. Late-game cleaners such as Scyther, Gorebyss, and Rain Dance Omastar are good Spikes partners, appreciating the extra push of Spikes damage to KO bulkier targets.</p>"

  "Walrein": {
    "overview": "<p>Walrein distinguishes itself as a Water-type with a balance of bulk and offensive presence that allows it to serve as a check to threats such as Scyther, Gligar, Omastar, Arcanine, and Nidoqueen. Its secondary Ice typing gives it an offensive edge over other Water-types such as Blastoise, as it offers Walrein an Ice Beam that threatens Vileplume and Cradily while scoring notable KOs on important targets such as Scyther. Moreover, unlike its main competitor Lapras, Walrein retains a key resistance to Fire- thanks to its ability Thick Fat, making it more reliable against Arcanine.</p> <p>In spite of these attributes, Walrein faces stiff competition from other Water-types that offer appealing utility in the form of Rapid Spin or Heal Bell such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and most importantly Lapras, which on top of not being as susceptible to Toxic also tends to be more immediately threatening thanks to its access to Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt. Moreover, while Walrein is not a slouch offensively, it fails to effectively threaten some of the bulkiest Pokemon around, such as Kangaskhan and the aforementioned Lapras.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar is an alternative to Encore to phaze setup Pokemon and scout the opposing team while possibly racking Spikes damage. Protect lets Walrein get its health back from Leftovers safely and is quite effective alongside Toxic in addition to letting Walrein scout Explosion and what moves Choice Band users such as Solrock lock themselves into. Walrein can also choose to forego offensive investment and spend all of its EVs into bulk to be even more safe against the likes of Gligar, although it misses some important OHKOs against the Pokemon it is supposed to keep in check such as Arcanine and Scyther on top of being easier to switch into. Curse Walrein can consider Hidden Power Ghost to hit Misdreavus, Solrock, and Lunatone super effectively, but Ice Beam provides more important coverage overall. Substitute can be used alongside Encore, as Walrein can get some free turns by locking the opposing Pokemon into a move ineffective against Substitute such as Toxic, or get a free Substitute after locking an opposing Pokemon into an undesirable move with Encore. Rest can also be considered on non-Curse sets to provide Walrein some longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Walrein usually fails to outdamage Kangaskhan's Rest loop and can get poisoned or slowly worn down as a result. The only thing Kangaskhan has to worry about from standard Walrein is Encore, which can lock it into an inconvenient move. On the other hand, Curse Walrein has a better shot at eventually breaking through Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: By virtue of its typing, Lanturn can switch into Walrein without much trouble and threaten it with Thunderbolt, but it has to watch out for Toxic, Earthquake, and Hidden Power Grass. Ampharos has enough special bulk to withstand several Ice Beams while doing a large amount of damage with Thunderbolt and bypassing Toxic with Heal Bell, but it has to respect repeated hits from Walrein's STAB moves. Other Electric-types such as Electabuzz, Manectric, Electrode, and Raichu also threaten Walrein but have more trouble switching into its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Bad poison outweighs Leftovers recovery and heavily hampers Walrein's durability as a result, especially if it lacks Rest. Spikes are also very troublesome, as they limit Walrein's ability to switch into the threats it's supposed to keep in check such as Scyther, Gligar, and Arcanine.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Lapras fears virtually nothing from non-Hidden Power Walrein, as it can shrug off Toxic with Heal Bell and threaten Walrein with Thunderbolt, although it fails to 3HKO Curse Walrein. The same applies to opposing Walrein if Walrein lacks Toxic or Hidden Power Grass. Curse Lapras, Curse Walrein, and Calm Mind Slowking can also use Walrein lacking Encore or Roar as setup fodder. If Walrein lacks Earthquake or Hidden Power Electric, then it is powerless against Tentacruel and Spikes fodder for Qwilfish. Feraligatr is more susceptible to Toxic and Hidden Power but can otherwise set up with Swords Dance on Walrein and threaten it with a boosted Rock Slide. Phazers such as Roar Lapras, Roar Blastoise, and Encore Walrein are also suited to prevent Curse Walrein from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Although they would prefer not directly switching into Walrein, Hitmonlee and Hitmontop have enough bulk to stomach a hit and pressure Walrein with their super effective STAB moves. On the rarer side, Poliwrath resists Walrein's STAB combination and can hide behind a Substitute and threaten either to set up with Bulk Up or Belly Drum or to fire off a powerful Focus Punch, as long as it doesn't get forced out by Encore, Roar, or a super effective Hidden Power.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Users</strong>: Without Encore, Walrein can be exploited by Calm Mind users such as Grumpig and Golduck, both of which can also dodge Toxic with Substitute and boost their Special Defense to prevent Walrein from breaking the Substitute with its STAB moves. However, Earthquake can break their Substitute regardless of Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Super Effective Coverage</strong>: With a bit of chip damage, Walrein can be revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Choice Band Solrock, Nidoqueen, and Haunter, but none of these want to fight Walrein from full health unless Walrein is asleep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its bulk, coverage, and STAB combination, Walrein is a very resilient Pokemon in a lot of one-on-one matchups. Ice Beam threatens Flying-, Grass-, and Ground-types such as Scyther, Gligar, Cradily, Vileplume, and Nidoqueen. Earthquake effectively threatens Lanturn as well as Poison-types such as Tentacruel and Qwilfish, all of which could take advantage of Walrein otherwise. Surf threatens Arcanine with a potential OHKO, making Walrein a more reliable answer to that threat. Surf also covers Rock-types such as Solrock, Lunatone, and Aggron while hitting Glalie fairly hard, preventing it from getting Spikes too easily on Walrein. Surf also can be used to save Ice Beam PP in long battles. Hidden Power Grass is another method to damage Water-types, most notably threatening Omastar with a potential OHKO to prevent it from getting Spikes on the field. Hidden Power Electric is also an option if Walrein doesn't pack Earthquake, as unlike Hidden Power Grass, it retains a super effective hit on Tentacruel and Qwilfish. Toxic pressures Pokemon that Walrein cannot effectively break through such as Kangaskhan, Hypno, and other Water-types such as Lapras, Blastoise, Feraligatr, and opposing Walrein. Alternatively, Encore can allow Walrein to check some setup sweepers such as Curse Lapras and Calm Mind Slowking. It can also be used to lock some of Walrein's usual answers such as Kangaskhan and Lapras into undesirable moves, thus creating opportunities for Walrein's teammates.</p> <p>The given EV spread ensures that Walrein can avoid 2HKOs from Hidden Power Grass from Arcanine as well as Double-Edge from Choice Band Scyther after one layer of Spikes. The rest is spent into Special Attack to allow Walrein to hit as hard as possible, enough to ensure OHKOs on Scyther and Solrock with Ice Beam and Surf, respectively. More EVs in Special Attack can be considered to hit other notable benchmarks; 212 Special Attack EVs guarantees that Surf will OHKO Arcanine without any defensive investment, and it is more than enough to OHKO standard defensive Omastar with Hidden Power Grass. 44 EVs can be spent in Speed to outrun uninvested Solrock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Walrein does a decent job at handling Scyther, it struggles to switch in repeatedly on Choice Band variants and therefore appreciates backups to play around its usual attacks. In this regard, Omastar and Arcanine are good teammates; the former brings Spikes, while the latter offers a priority move to deal with Reversal variants of Scyther. Walrein is commonly forced out by Electric-types such as Ampharos and Lanturn. Therefore, specially bulky or Electric-resistant Pokemon suited to deal with these threats such as Kangaskhan, Vileplume, and Cradily are welcome additions to teams featuring Walrein. Walrein is also quite susceptible to residual damage in the forms of Spikes and Toxic. As a result, Rapid Spin users like Tentacruel and Hitmontop as well as clerics such as Ampharos, Vileplume, and Altaria are partners of choice. Finally, Walrein struggles against Pokemon that can take its hits comfortably while circumventing Toxic, which notably includes Rest users such as Kangaskhan and Slowking as well as Lapras. Thus, it is a good idea to pack offensive threats that can take advantage of most of these Pokemon once they are asleep or using Heal Bell. Focus Punch Kangaskhan, Swords Dance Scyther, Electabuzz, and Focus Punch Ampharos are good candidates to accomplish this task.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>With this set, Walrein can turn into a potent wincon that can defeat some of its usual checks. Although it heavily competes with Lapras due to the latter's greater special bulk and access to Shell Armor, Curse Walrein retains some merits to warrant consideration, most notably Earthquake, which makes Walrein much more immediately threatening to Electric-types that would be used to force Walrein out. Ice Beam may seem like an odd choice for a physically oriented sweeper, but it complements Earthquake nicely by hitting Flying-types such as Scyther, Gligar, Altaria, and Xatu without any prior boosts. It also dents Vileplume, which otherwise can be extremely problematic to this variant of Walrein due to Leech Seed and Hidden Power Grass. Rest is mandatory to keep Walrein healthy and cure it from status afflictions.</p> <p>The EV spread and Sassy nature aim to make Walrein as specially bulky as possible to make it harder to break through both specially and physically after Curse boosts. Walrein usually wants at least 236 EVs in Special Defense to ensure that Modest Lapras's Thunderbolt will never 3HKO without factoring critical hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>One of the most direct ways to prevent Curse Walrein from sweeping is to force it to use Rest before attacking it with Electric-type attacks from the likes of Ampharos and Lanturn. Thus, specially bulky Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Vileplume, and Cradily that are suited to handle Electric-types make for solid teammates. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Solrock and Hitmonlee are also able to threaten Walrein with a 2HKO even after a Curse boost, which makes physically defensive backups such as Nidoqueen, Gligar, and Vileplume good backbones. Other setup sweepers such as Lunatone and Swords Dance Feraligatr may be tempted to set up alongside Walrein and break through it. Therefore, it is a good idea to pack checks to these problematic Pokemon such as Roar Blastoise. There may be scenarios where Walrein is forced out after using Rest, so clerics such as Ampharos, Vileplume, and Altaria make for useful backups to spare Walrein from having to burn sleep turns by itself. Finally, Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel, Blastoise, and Hitmontop can clear the field of Spikes, easing Walrein's attempts to set up in front of Pokemon such as Tentacruel, Scyther, and Gligar.</p>"

Due to having a pure Water-type, you can't switch Gorebyss in on resistances, as Ice and Water are its only resistances, and you would get Toxiced by the common Waters.</p> <p>Rain Dance boosts your Speed and powers up Surf, turning Gorebyss into an offensive powerhouse.</p>"}, "Baton Pass": {"description": "<p>Baton Passer.
