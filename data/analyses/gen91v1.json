Moonblast is the most reliable and is usually the one that works in the most matchups like opposing Iron Valiant and Walking Wake, while Low Kick can help it break through Steel-type Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Registeel, though, it's scared of Counter from the former.</li> <li>The Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Choice Scarf Porygon-Z, with the remaining EVs going into Defense so it can bulk physical hits and fire back with its Encore + Disable setup.</li> <li>To utilize Encore + Disable effectively, you usually have to use Protect on the first turn to scout the foe's first move. If you are certain it is a Choice-locked Pokemon, you can just use Disable on the second turn and force it to use Struggle, and if it utilizes a status move, you are free to use Encore on its move and attack with your main STAB move; otherwise, it is recommended to use Encore on the second turn to take a hit, then Protect on the third turn, then Disable on the fourth turn, and, once Encore is over, you use Encore again. This ensures 2 turns of Struggle from the foe, at which point Iron Valiant should be able to KO it. On more passive Pokemon that have moves that do little damage like Registeel, it sometimes can be better to opt out of using Protect and just use your main attack.</li> <li>Iron Valiant fits best on teams that can cover their main weakness to Steel-type Pokemon; therefore, Fire-type Pokemon like Volcarona and Skeledirge make great teammates. In return, Iron Valiant can handle threats like Choice Specs Greninja and Choice Band Ursaluna. Iron Valiant also appreciates Pecharunt and Hisuian Goodra being extremely consistent against Fairy-types, as these can easily deal with them while it deals with Ground-type Pokemon like Great Tusk and the previously mentioned Ursaluna.</li> </ul>"

Psyshock takes care of Iron Moth, while Icy Wind can usually beat both Landorus formes, though it has to watch out for Assault Vest Landorus-T with Fly.</li> <li>A Modest nature maximizes damage and ensures some OHKOs like non-Chople Berry Hisuian Goodra but for most matchups like non-bulky Ogerpon-W, Iron Moth, and non-Speed Booster Energy Walking Wake, it is better to run a Timid nature.</li> <li>Iron Valiant's HP and Special Defense EVs let it survive a Special Attack Booster Energy Raging Bolt's Thunderclap so it's safe to OHKO back with Moonblast, with the remaining EVs used on Speed and Special Attack to maximize its ability to outspeed and threaten frail threats.</li> <li>Iron Valiant really struggles to put a dent on Fairy-type Pokemon like Sylveon and Primarina, so Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon like Pecharunt and Hisuian Goodra can be really helpful to shut down these threats.</li> <li>Iron Valiant can struggle with Psychic-types like Iron Crown and Metagross, as it can't do much damage to them, so Dark-types like Meowscarada, Darkrai, and Hoopa-U work as good partners for it.</li> </ul>"
