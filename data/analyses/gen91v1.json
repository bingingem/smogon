Moonblast is the most reliable and is usually the one that works in the most matchups like opposing Iron Valiant and Walking Wake, while Low Kick is extremely helpful in the Gouging Fire matchup and can help it break through Steel-type Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Registeel, though, it's scared of Counter from the former.</li> <li>The Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Gouging Fire after a Dragon Dance, with the remaining EVs going into Defense so it can bulk physical hits and fire back with its Encore + Disable setup.</li> <li>To utilize Encore + Disable effectively, you usually have to use Protect on the first turn to scout the foe's first move. If you are certain it is a Choice-locked Pokemon, you can just use Disable on the second turn and force it to use Struggle, and if it utilizes a status move, you are free to use Encore on its move and attack with your main STAB move; otherwise, it is recommended to use Encore on the second turn to take a hit, then Protect on the third turn, then Disable on the fourth turn, and, once Encore is over, you use Encore again. This ensures 2 turns of Struggle from the foe, at which point Iron Valiant should be able to KO it. On more passive Pokemon that have moves that do little damage like Registeel, and in some rare cases like Gouging Fire if you only have Moonblast, it sometimes can be better to opt out of using Protect and just use your main attack.</li> <li>Iron Valiant fits best on teams that can cover their main weakness to Steel-type Pokemon; therefore, Fire-type Pokemon like Volcarona and Gouging Fire make great teammates. In return, Iron Valiant can handle threats like Choice Specs Greninja and Choice Band Ursaluna. Iron Valiant also appreciates Pecharunt and Hisuian Goodra being extremely consistent against Fairy-types, as these can easily deal with them while it deals with Ground-type Pokemon like Great Tusk and the previously mentioned Ursaluna.</li> </ul>"
