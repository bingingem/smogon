Use this move liberally to gather information about opponents' sets and scout for items like Rocky Helmet, which will KO Shedinja using Shadow Sneak or X-Scissor. Scouting items is especially effective in the Battle Stadium format due to the Item Clause, which allows for a process of elimination to deduce other foes' items.</p> </li> <li> <p>Will-O-Wisp allows Shedinja to burn incoming physical attackers looking to KO it, making them easier to deal with for teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shadow Sneak lets Shedinja revenge kill faster foes that have been sufficiently weakened.</p> </li> <li> <p>Endure allows Shedinja to scout for super effective attacks, including surprise Max Moves, and is particularly useful if not utilizing a Focus Sash. Use Endure liberally, as teams that appear to be weak to Shedinja at first glance may have surprise coverage options to overcome it.</p> </li> <li> <p>X-Scissor is an alternative to Endure that lets Shedinja hit Dark-types super effectively and keeps Normal-types from completely walling it, but it won't be able to scout for fatal coverage. Even with X-Scissor, Shedinja still will not deal much damage to most Normal- and Dark-types, so teammates that can handle them make for great partners. Urshifu-R can both threaten them and the majority of entry hazard setters in the metagame, which threaten to instantly KO Shedinja switching in unless it's holding Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protect may seem appealing instead of Endure, further allowing Shedinja to scout for moves like Leech Seed, Toxic, and Will-O-Wisp. However, it leaves Shedinja vulnerable to Max Moves, making Endure the superior option in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Lonely nature, along with 0 IVs in Defense and Special Defense, is chosen to improve the matchup against Ditto, since Shedinja can't benefit from bulk investment itself.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p>Focus Sash allows Shedinja to survive one super effective attack without having to use Endure, but it leaves Shedinja vulnerable to any form of indirect damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Shedinja from fainting to entry hazard damage. Notably, it can let Shedinja wall hazard setters reliant on Stealth Rock to take it out, such as Swampert and Mamoswine lacking Rock Tomb.

It also can punish a Zacian-C trying to grab a free switch on Mirror Coat.</p> </li> <li> <p>Yawn can help play around Dynamax sweepers like Zapdos, forcing them out and potentially allowing Gastrodon to get a vital Recover off.
