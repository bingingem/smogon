        "description": "<p>Dragonite is an incredible defensive utility Pokemon thanks to its good stats and useful typing that let it check foes such as Landorus, Ogerpon-W, and Ogerpon-H. It also has a good movepool, with Haze and Dragon Tail making for great anti-setup moves and Roost providing recovery for its team; Multiscale also helps to improve the team's defensive capabilities. Dragon Tail and Haze are good against setup sweepers like Iron Hands, Gholdengo, and Swords Dance Ogerpon formes. Dragon Tail is good for accumulating chip damage, especially on entry hazard-stacking teams, while Haze can clear both foes' stat boosts and teammates' Intimidate drops, and it also works against Fairy-types like Primarina and Diancie as well as Tera Fairy users like Archaludon. Iron Head is good against the aforementioned Fairy-types and Alolan Ninetales as well as Chien-Pao. Ice Spinner hits both Landorus formes, as well as clearing Psychic Terrain. Roost helps provide the team with longevity, helping Dragonite fulfill its role as a defensive wall better. The given EV spread allows Dragonite to survive an Adamant Chien Pao's Icicle Crash and a Life Orb Kyurem's Blizzard with Multiscale. Dragonite struggles against foes that can hit it super effectively like Porygon2, Chien-Pao, Primarina, and Raging Bolt. Dragonite also does not like Incineroar, as it can weaken Dragonite's damage output with Intimidate, prevent it from moving with Fake Out, and remove its Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off to prevent it from switching in as often if Stealth Rock is up. Tera Steel grants Dragonite a boost to its Iron Head's damage and allows it to flip the matchup on the aforementioned checks, gaining a resistance to the Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type moves that would otherwise threaten it. However, Tera Steel does worsen the matchup against Incineroar and prevents Dragonite from checking foes that it normally checks, like Landorus and Ogerpon-H.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Setters</strong>: Teammates like Landorus-T and Ting-Lu make for good partners, as Dragonite can take advantage of their entry hazards and its ability to phaze foes to rack up extra hazard chip damage. In return, Dragonite helps them with the longevity issues they struggle with. Be wary of stacking up Ice-weak teammates when using these partners, as foes like Chien-Pao and Kyurem may become problematic to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Fire- and Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Incineroar, Volcanion, and Gholdengo appreciate Dragonite's ability to switch in on the Ground-type moves that threaten them. Dragonite can also provide recovery to the former two, helping them stay on the field for longer. In return, these partners are good against the Ice- and Fairy-types that Dragonite struggles with, and Incineroar can help Dragonite tank physical attacks better thanks to Intimidate, while Gholdengo gives Dragonite a Spore immunity with Good as Gold.</p>"

With its bulk, it can redirect and absorb various hits by using Rage Powder, as well as threatening to debilitate foes with Spore. Pollen Puff heals Amoonguss's ally even under the effects of Taunt, and Clear Smog negates attempts to set up against Amoonguss. Protect can be used over Clear Smog if Amoonguss's team has ample ways of beating setup Pokemon or does not have enough protection moves to share. Sitrus Berry is best for aiding in Amoonguss's longevity, allowing it to take more hits while redirecting attacks or spreading sleep. The EV spread allows it to survive two uses of Bleakwind Storm from Timid Tornadus with Sitrus Berry, and 28 Speed IVs allow it to underspeed base 50 Speed Pokemon with minimum investment such as Kingambit and Iron Hands. Unfortunately, Amoonguss struggles against opposing Grass-types and Gholdengo because of their immunity to Spore, so teammates like Heatran and Landorus-T are welcome to prevent Gholdengo from being on the battlefield. Amoonguss also struggles against Pokemon with Safety Goggles, so it appreciates Pokemon like Incineroar that can remove said item with Knock Off to help improve Spore's utility. Tera Water allows Amoonguss to resist Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Incineroar while preserving its resistance against Water-type attacks, while Tera Dark gives it an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from Pokemon like Hoopa-U and provides an immunity to Prankster-boosted moves, most importantly Taunt from Tornadus.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Fast Pokemon or Pokemon With Prankster</strong>: While Amoonguss is very slow, Prankster Pokemon such as Tornadus and Grimmsnarl solve this issue by allowing themselves and Amoonguss to have a Prankster-boosted Spore. Fast Pokemon such as Chien-Pao also appreciate being able to use Spore against slower Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Other Defensive Utility Pokemon</strong>: Amoonguss is a good fit on bulkier teams thanks to giving its ally Regenerator and Clear Smog. Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Incineroar appreciate Amoonguss's ability to give them Regenerator, greatly increasing their longevity, and in return, they give Amoonguss more utility moves in order to be less passive.</p> <p><strong>Setup Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Gholdengo appreciate Amoonguss's ability to redirect attacks so they can set up safely. Furthermore, Swords Dance Ogerpon-H has Mold Breaker, giving Amoonguss the ability to use Spore on Gholdengo.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room Setters</strong>: Trick Room setters like Diancie or Porygon2 allow Amoonguss's poor Speed stat to shine, giving themselves and Amoonguss the chance to use Spore on both of the opposing Pokemon. These Pokemon also appreciate Amoonguss being able to redirect certain attacks to ensure Trick Room is set.</p>"

Taunt allows Tornadus to shut down foes like Amoonguss and prevent Pokemon like Porygon2 from setting Trick Room. The given EV spread allows Tornadus to live a Psycho Boost from Deoxys-A, and the remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack. Covert Cloak is used to nullify the flinching effect of Fake Out, allowing Tornadus to set up Tailwind without worrying about foes such as Incineroar and Iron Hands stopping it. Alternatively, Tera Ghost can be used for a similar effect, additionally granting Tornadus immunity to Extreme Speed from foes such as Dragonite and Entei. If Tera Ghost is used, Sitrus Berry should be used to increase Tornadus's survivability. Tera Steel provides Tornadus with a resistance to Rock-type coverage, such as Rock Slide from foes like Tyranitar and Landorus-T. Tornadus struggles against Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Raging Bolt, as they resist Bleakwind Storm and can threaten back with massive damage, so Ground-types like both Landorus formes can help. Weather-setting moves like Rain Dance and Sunny Day are options over Protect on weather teams, ensuring weather can stay up.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Offensive Threats</strong>: Generally strong offensive Pokemon appreciate Tornadus's ability to set Tailwind, as offensive teams can make use of Tailwind the best. Additionally, offensive teams appreciate the chip damage that Tornadus deals with Bleakwind Storm, and the prevention of Trick Room with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Support Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that appreciate Prankster like Amoonguss are good partners for Tornadus due to it helping them fulfill their role as support Pokemon better, such as giving Amoonguss’s Spore priority.</p> <p><strong>Water-, Electric-, and Ground-types</strong>: Teammates like Ogerpon-W, Iron Hands, and both Landorus formes appreciate Tornadus’s ability to threaten the many common Grass-type foes such as Amoonguss, Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Sinistcha, with Landorus in particular benefitting from being able to use Bleakwind Storm.</p>"

Sludge Bomb hits foes such as Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Ogerpon-H, while Substitute allows it to punish Protect, get around moves such as Spore, avoid Fake Out while still being able to attack (unlike Protect), and stall out Trick Room. Sandsear Storm gives Landorus a spread option, while Imprison can be used to stop moves like Fake Out, Trick Room, and Protect alongside teammates like Incineroar, Sinistcha, and the multitude of Protect users, respectively. Imprison can also help massively in the Landorus + Tornadus mirror, as it can block almost all of the foe's moves. Sheer Force can sometimes be a double-edged sword for Landorus’s teammates, as it can remove important secondary effects, most notably Fake Out. Landorus struggles with Porygon2, as it can take its attacks well and fire back with a powerful Ice Beam, as well as being able to set Trick Room to make it vulnerable to slower offensive foes. Levitate and Earth Eater users like Orthworm, Latios, and Latias can also be a problem for Landorus, as they will grant their team an immunity to Ground; Latios and Latias also outspeed Landorus and OHKO it with Ice Beam. Tera Poison brings extra power to Landorus's Sludge Bomb, while also providing a decent defensive typing that removes a lot of its weaknesses. Alternatively, Tera Steel is a purely defensive Tera that notably gives Landorus a resistance to Chien-Pao's Ice-type attacks but most importantly is an all-round good defensive type.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Speed control such as Tornadus and Tailwind Latias prevents Landorus from being outsped and revenge killed, allowing it to wallbreak much more effectively. Tornadus in particular can also provide a spread Flying-type STAB move for Landorus, while Landorus's Sheer Force can boost both Tornadus's and Latias's firepower.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Landorus can share its Sheer Force with many offensive threats to boost their damage output, such as Chien-Pao, Volcanion, and Heatran. These teammates may also have typing-based offensive synergy with Landorus, with Chien-Pao beating Latios and Latias as well as the Flying-types that can be problematic for Landorus.</p>"

Sitrus Berry increases Landorus-T's longevity, while Safety Goggles helps against Spore. The given EV spread lets Landorus-T survive Freeze-Dry from Choice Specs Iron Bundle after Terastallizing and a +2 Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt. Landorus-T struggles against super effective moves from Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-W, and Walking Wake without Terastallizing. Tera Water removes Landorus-T's Ice weakness, which can be helpful against Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle. Tera Grass is an alternative that can help against Water-types like Ogerpon-W and let Landorus-T ignore Sleep Powder and Rage Powder from Hisuian Lilligant and Sinistcha, respectively.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Other Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Other defensive Pokemon like Incineroar, Tornadus, and Amoonguss can be good teammates for Landorus-T, as they form good defensive backbones with it. Additionally, Incineroar makes a double Intimidate core, which neutralizes most physical attackers, with Landorus-T; Tornadus provides Prankster-boosted Stealth Rock and speed control with Tailwind; and Amoonguss shares Regenerator. <strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: Bulky setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Gholdengo and Dragon Dance Dragonite appreciate the presence of Landorus-T, as it can help increase their survivability with Intimidate and help them secure KOs with entry hazards.</p>"

Roar can be used as an alternative to Haze that's especially good on more defensive and entry hazard stack teams that Volcanion fits well on. Leftovers allows Volcanion to slowly heal itself, making it harder for it to be overwhelmed. Heavy-Duty Boots removes Volcanion's weakness to Stealth Rock, particularly benefiting more defensive teams, as it is harder for them prevent entry hazards from being set up, as well as helping Volcanion to pivot around more easily. Ability Shield is an alternative option that allows Volcanion to keep its Water-type immunity against teams with a Mold Breaker user. If Volcanion is being used on a team with Tailwind, then using 108 Speed EVs is recommended, as this allows it to outspeed Chien-Pao in Tailwind. Volcanion struggles with strong attackers such as Landorus and Raging Bolt due to its middling Speed allowing it to be overwhelmed easily. Tera Fairy is used as an all-round good defensive typing, giving useful resistances to moves such as Chien-Pao's Dark-type coverage and Dragon-type coverage from Pokemon like Walking Wake, Latios, and Kingdra. However, Tera Fairy can leave Volcanion vulnerable to foes such as Gholdengo. Tera Ground is an alternative option that turns Volcanion's weakness to Electric-type moves from foes like Raging Bolt and Iron Hands into an immunity while also powering up its Earth Power. In a pinch, Volcanion can support its ally by targeting it with Steam Eruption, healing it due to Water Absorb.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and both Landorus formes are great partners for Volcanion, as it can protect them from Water-type attacks with Water Absorb. Additionally, Ting-Lu and Landorus-T increase Volcanion's bulk with their abilities, while Landorus increases the power of Volcanion's attacks with Sheer Force, and Volcanion gives it Fire- and Water-type coverage in return. These Ground-types also are very strong against Electric-type foes such as Raging Bolt and Iron Hands that Volcanion struggles with.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers like Rillaboom and Chien-Pao appreciate Volcanion being strong against Incineroar. The two examples given are also strong against the Ground-type foes such as Landorus and Landorus-T that threaten Volcanion.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Setters</strong>: Volcanion appreciates teammates such as Mew, Ting-Lu, and Deoxys-D that can set entry hazards, as they can help chip down foes into range of Volcanion's attacks and take advantage of Pokemon trying to pivot around Volcanion. Additionally, entry hazards can force damage onto any foes that are forced to switch in due to Roar.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Users</strong> Prankster Pokemon like Tornadus, Grimmsnarl, and Whimsicott can help Volcanion by giving priority to Haze, allowing it to negate stat boosts before setup foes deal any meaningful damage.</p>"

Additionally, it provides plenty of support thanks to Good as Gold making both itself and its partner immune to status moves including  Amoonguss's Spore and Incineroar's Parting Shot. Make It Rain is Gholdengo's standout move as an exceptionally high-powered spread attack, taking down the likes of Chien-Pao and Glimmora easily as well as Rillaboom at +2. Shadow Ball pressures other Ghost-types such as Sinistcha and opposing Gholdengo effectively while also hitting Steel-resistant foes such as Ogerpon-H well. Gholdengo can choose to run Recover in lieu of Protect if the rest of the team can provide the latter, making it incredibly hard to remove. As Gholdengo wants to sit on the field for as long as possible, Leftovers is the primary recovery item chosen to maximize healing; however, Sitrus Berry is a fine option for more immediate HP recovery. Gholdengo's inability to hit Incineroar for any meaningful damage make partners such as Ogerpon-W and Landorus greatly appreciated. The given bulk EVs allow Gholdengo to survive Landorus-T's Stomping Tantrum, Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch, and Heatran's Flash Fire-boosted Lava Plume. Its Speed allows it to outrun Choice Scarf Landorus-T in Tailwind. Tera Dragon is generally preferred to resist both Ogerpon-H's and Ogerpon-W's STAB moves; however, Tera Water is also fine as a good defensive typing overall.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Bulky Support Pokemon</strong>: The likes of Incineroar, Amoonguss, and Indeedee-F help make Gholdengo shine, with Intimidate nullifying physical attackers almost entirely and Fake Out, Rage Powder, and Follow Me providing safe opportunities to use Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Other Setup Pokemon</strong>: Swords Dance Iron Hands and Cosmic Power Deoxys-D both appreicate Good as Gold granting them an immunity to common disruption such as Will-O-Wisp, Spore, and Taunt. Deoxys-D particularly appreciates Nasty Plot in order to boost its Stored Power damage even further.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon With Immunity Abilities</strong>: Pokemon such as Heatran and Latios provide Gholdengo with Flash Fire and Levitate, respectively, making it immediately immune to types it would otherwise be weak to.</p>"

Dazzling Gleam is one of the best coverage options for Gholdengo, allowing it to deal significant damage to the plethora of Dragon-types in the metagame such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake. Thunderbolt and Power Gem are alternative coverage options that improve Gholdengo's chances against Volcanion and Incineroar. Trick is an option that disrupts Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 as well as setup attackers like Iron Hands. Steel is Choice Specs Gholdengo's best Tera type, as it further boosts its strongest attack while also retaining its Dragon and Fairy resistances. Choice Specs is particularly good in Partners in Crime, as it allows Gholdengo to lock into its partner's move then later break the Choice lock by having its partner switch.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Tailwind Users</strong>: Whimsicott and Tornadus are Choice Specs Gholdengo's best friends, with Tailwind allowing it to deal massive damage immediately and its Good as Gold providing Whimsicott and Tornadus with a Taunt immunity. Whimsicott also offers Fake Tears to further boost Gholdengo's damage.</p> <p><strong>Setup Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that require setup to be as threatening as possible such as Swords Dance Rillaboom appreciate the immediate bursts of damage that Gholdengo can provide.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Given that Gholdengo can break its Choice lock at any time by having its partner switch, a strong special attacker such as Volcanion and Landorus makes for a great partner.

The last of these is appreciated by every Pokemon in the metagame due to Pokemon with Sword of Ruin not being affected by the ability. In particular, physical attackers take the best advantage of the ability, as their own damage output is boosted. Ice Spinner is Chien-Pao's preferred Ice-type STAB move thanks to its consistency over Icicle Crash and the ability to disrupt Indeedee-F's Psychic Terrain. Icicle Crash is a marginally stronger option that can be used if the team features a Terrain it wishes to preserve, which also comes with a flinch chance that is often felt due to Chien-Pao's high Speed. Sucker Punch is a must-have on Chien-Pao, as it allows it a form of damage even when playing against opposing Tailwind or Trick Room teams, notably pressuring the likes of Gholdengo effectively. Sacred Sword is generally preferred as a means to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB moves such as Incineroar and Heatran while also ignoring defensive boosts from the likes of IronPress Kommo-o. Haze is a great alternative to shut down opposing setup such as Gholdengo's Nasty Plot and Rillaboom's Swords Dance. Throat Chop is a stronger Dark-type option that also shuts down moves such as Incineroar's Parting Shot. Focus Sash is Chien-Pao's best item, as it helps patch up its otherwise mediocre bulk; meanwhile, Clear Amulet helps to staveoff Intimidate from Incineroar and Landorus-T. Tera Ghost is Chien-Pao's preferred Tera type, turning its Fighting weakness into an immunity while granting it a Fake Out immunity to help preserve its Focus Sash.

In a pinch, Ogerpon-W can also use Ivy Cudgel on a teammate to provide a small bit of healing thanks to Water Absorb. Wood Hammer is stronger, at the cost of having recoil, while Horn Leech improves Ogerpon-W's longevity throughout a battle. Follow Me helps allies like Gholdengo and Iron Hands to set up, as well as helping Trick Room users such as Porygon2 to set it up safely. Spiky Shield is a useful option that can protect Ogerpon-W from double targets and help it stall out Trick Room, while Swords Dance synergises well with Follow Me and can be used if other teammates are carrying Protect.

Ogerpon-W is forced into Tera Water, but it uniquely gives Ogerpon-W a useful Special Defense boost, helping against Pokemon like Gholdengo and Tornadus.</p> <h4>Notable Partners</h4> <p><strong>Intimidate Answers</strong>: Pokemon that can take advantage of Intimidate like Galarian Zapdos and Kingambit or Pokemon that can block it like Dragonite make for good partners, as they can prevent Ogerpon-W's damage output from being lowered. When alongside these Intimidate answers, Ogerpon-W can utilize its good matchup into Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Incineroar and check them properly.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Ogerpon-W is good with a lot of physical attackers such as Chien Pao, Iron Hands, and Ursaluna. Ogerpon-W can pass them Swords Dance and help them set up with Follow Me or utilize its strong offensive synergy with these teammates, such as Chien Pao beating the Grass- and Dragon-types that Ogerpon-W struggles with, Ogerpon-W beating Landorus for Iron Hands and Iron Hands beating Tornadus in return, and Ursaluna beating Dragonite for Ogerpon-W. Additionally, Chien-Pao provides Sword of Ruin, making the duo very obnoxious to switch into considering the type synergy between them, as well as making Ivy Cudgel more of a threat against Incineroar.</p> <p><strong>Water-weak Pokemon</strong> Teammates such as Heatran, Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and both Landorus formes appreciate the Water immunity that Ogerpon-W grants to its team. Follow Me can enable Substitute users like Landorus and Heatran, while Heatran can check Rlilaboom, Sinistcha, and Amoonguss. Glimmora can provide entry hazard support to chip down would-be checks to Ogerpon-W, as well as check Flying-types like Tornadus and Dragonite that would otherwise cause problems.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room Setters</strong> Pokemon like Porygon2 and Diancie benefit from Ogerpon-W’s ability to redirect attacks that would otherwise threaten them, allowing them to set up Trick Room more easily. These teammates also have additional synergies, such as Porygon2 passing Download and Diancie passing Clear Body, as well as Ogerpon-W providing Diancie with a Water immunity.</p>"
