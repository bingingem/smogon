  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>In a metagame like VGC 2019 where positioning is an essential aspect of the game, Mega Gengar is extremely powerful as its ability, Shadow Tag, gives its trainer superior control of the field by denying the opponent the ability to switch. Along with Shadow Tag, Mega Gengar boasts a huge base 170 Special Attack, which allows it to deal a huge chunk of damage on even neutral hits. Because of this, Mega Gengar can switch into Fairy-types and secure the KO regardless of how much health they have, since they are trapped by Shadow Tag. Despite its strengths, Mega Gengar is very weak defensively, which can easily lead to situations where it is threatened with an OHKO when the opponent has the Speed advantage. This can be played around with good use of Protect, Substitute, and Fake Out support from Pokemon like Incineroar. Mega Gengar also doesn't match up well against Primal Groudon as well as Tapu Lele, which often carries a Choice Scarf and can outspeed and OHKO it. Mega Gengar also doesn't like facing Dark-types like Incineroar, Yveltal, and Umbreon because of their access to Snarl, which hits through Substitute, as well as Ghost-types like Lunala, Mimikyu, and opposing Mega Gengar, which are all unaffected by Shadow Tag and can threaten Mega Gengar back.</p>",

      "Shadow Tag Utilizer": {
        "description": "<p>Sludge Bomb lets Mega Gengar threaten Xerneas and prevent it from setting up a Geomancy. Even though Sludge Bomb won't KO a full HP Xerneas, having Sludge Bomb's poison chance proc will secure the KO on even bulky variants. Teams that struggle with Lunala and Necrozma can use Shadow Ball as their second move, although Lunala's Shadow Shield will need to be broken to KO it. Perish Song can be used otherwise, even on teams that aren't dedicated to using Perish Song, since it provides an extra win condition at very little cost. Substitute is a very strong move on Gengar, since it forces the opponent to double target Gengar if they want to KO it, which helps cover up its lack of bulk. This becomes especially powerful when the opponent has a Pokemon that provides very little offensive pressure, like Tapu Fini or Amoonguss, trapped, since you can be certain that Gengar won't be KOed that turn. Having a Substitute set up can let Gengar take a hit while still putting on offensive pressure with Sludge Bomb. Additionally, Substitute can also stall for turns with Perish Song. Protect is an essential move on any Shadow Tag user, as it lets the Shadow Tag user stay on the field longer and let its partner either set up in a favorable position or deal with the opposing Pokemon that can't switch out. With 140 HP and 68 Special Defense EVs, Mega Gengar can live an Origin Pulse from a Modest maximum Special Attack Kyogre outside of rain, which can be helpful in the RayOgre matchup.</p> <p>When using Gengar, it's ideal to Mega Evolve as soon as it's on the field to gain access to Shadow Tag right away. Even if you lead Gengar into something unfavorable, Mega Evolving and using Protect first is worth considering rather than just switching it out right away, as this gives you the option to switch Mega Gengar into a favorable position and have Shadow Tag active right away instead of having one turn where Gengar needs to Mega Evolve, allowing the opponent to reposition. Incineroar is an absolute must-run with Mega Gengar as, the combination of Fake Out, Intimidate, and slow U-turn enhance Mega Gengar's trapping game tremendously. An Incineroar and Gengar lead can set up for a potentially free Substitute or let you reposition to something more favorable. Incineroar can also help Mega Gengar keep its trapping active, since you can switch Mega Gengar out and U-turn back into it while Incineroar soaks up any incoming attacks. Mega Gengar also pairs extremely well with both Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, as Shadow Tag enables better control of the weather. Another Pokemon that pairs well with Mega Gengar is Landorus-T, as Landorus-T can threaten opposing Primal Groudon and Incineroar with a Ground-type Z-Move with very little risk, since Shadow Tag prevents them from switching into a Pokemon with a Ground immunity.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent respectable base 125 Attack combined with powerful moves like Double-Edge and Low Kick, Mega Kangaskhan establishes itself as a potent attacker in VGC 2019. Additionally, its access to the fastest viable Fake Out, as well as other utility moves like Roar and Sucker Punch, let it be a great supportive presence. Arguably, Mega Kangaskhanâ€™s best tool comes in the form of Bite, which offers an absurd 51% flinch rate when combined with the second hit from Parental Bond. Additionally, Scrappy in its base forme, as well as Bite and Sucker Punch, allows it to put pressure on Ghost-types like Lunala and Mega Gengar. Mega Kangaskhan is commonly paired with Xerneas to assist in setting up with Geomancy, and Primal Groudon, which appreciates the support in order to freely use its full power Eruption, thanks to flinches from Fake Out and Bite. Mega Kangaskhan often prefers to lead into games with a supportive partner like Tornadus to grab early-game momentum with Fake Out and Tailwind. While powerful, Mega Kangaskhan still struggles with Steel-types like Mega Metagross, Stakataka, and Ferrothorn if lacking Low Kick. Other faster Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Rayquaza can all outspeed and put instant pressure on it. Mega Kangaskhan is also quite weak to Intimidate, as it drastically reduces its damage output, often forcing the user to play for Bite flinches and rely on luck to keep an advantage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Fast Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Fake Out's guaranteed flinch gives Mega Kangaskhan's partners more time to set up. STAB Double-Edge deals strong consistent damage making use of Parental Bond, letting Mega Kangaskhan 2HKO Pokemon like Xerneas and Primal Kyogre. Bite forces the opponent to respect the possibility of being flinched every turn while the user is often inclined to play for it. Low Kick allows Mega Kangaskhan to OHKO Pokemon like Stakataka as well as chunk Incineroar, Ferrothorn, and Primal Kyogre without the recoil from Double-Edge. Sucker Punch is an alternative to Low Kick as it lets Mega Kangaskhan get the jump on faster Ghost-types like Mega Gengar as well as enabling it to take out any low HP targets before they can move. Roar lets Mega Kangaskhan force out Trick Room setters and boosted Xerneas. Mega Kangaskhan always wants to invest in Speed first, as it naturally outruns common restricted Pokemon like Xerneas and Yveltal at maximum Speed, while also giving it the fastest Bite possible. Scrappy lets Kangaskhan utilize Fake Out on Ghost-types before Mega Evolving, allowing it to hit Pokemon like Lunala and Mimikyu as well as break Shadow Shield and Disguise.</p> <p>Mega Kangaskhan is often paired with Xerneas to enable it to set up with Geomancy with Fake Out and Bite while pressuring Steel-types like Stakataka with an OHKO from Low Kick. Mega Kangaskhan also is paired with strong spread attackers like Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon which can opt for a fatal Water Spout and Eruption. It is commonly led with Pokemon that can utilize speed control like Tornadus and Whimsicott so they can grab momentum early on and sweep with powerful restricted Pokemon in the back. This lets Mega Kangaskhan do its job as effectively as possible, as it allows it to lead and grab momentum for a team in comparison to making it a solely offensive juggernaut reserved in the back for late-game.</p>"

  "Groudon": {
    "overview": "<p>Primal Groudon is an insanely threatening Pokemon in VGC 2019 largely thanks to its superb offensive typing and high attacking stats coupled with its only weakness to Ground thanks to Desolate Land and solid natural bulk, making it both a force to be reckoned with offensively and a behemoth to remove defensively. Its access to two excellent spread moves, Precipice Blades and Eruption, make it capable of being a physical or special attacking powerhouse. Primal Groudon also acts as one of the best Xerneas checks in the metagame, since it resists its Fairy-type attacks and can threaten back with Precipice Blades, Fire Punch, or Overheat. Ironically enough, it's also one of the best Xerneas enablers in the metagame, as it pressures every Steel-type, as well as Amoonguss and Incineroar, all of which are sizeable roadblocks for Xerneas. However, its dominance is actually one of its biggest drawbacks, as using Primal Groudon results in playing a lot of mirror matches where games can be decided entirely on EV spreads or which player has an active Tailwind. The player must also be vigilant to win the weather war against Primal Kyogre because any Water-type attack is going to have no trouble OHKOing Primal Groudon. Dragon-types and faster special attackers such as Mega Salamence, Mega Rayquaza, Lunala, and Ultra Necrozma also match fairly well against it, as they can either wall it outright or deal devastating blows before it gets to move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Precipice Blades is Primal Groudon's best Ground STAB move, as the potential damage output is too high to consider more accurate moves with lower payoff such as Earthquake and Stomping Tantrum. It's powerful enough to OHKO Tapu Koko at -1 Attack and specially defensively Incineroar otherwise. Fire Punch serves as a more reliable STAB option that's capable of OHKOing Grass- and Steel-types such as Amoonguss, Mega Metagross, and Kartana under Desolate Land. Swords Dance allows Primal Groudon to boost its already sky-high Attack to insane levels, letting it OHKO Xerneas with +2 Fire Punch and counteract Intimidate. Dragon Claw is a good coverage option for Mega Salamence and Mega Rayquaza, which would otherwise wall it. Substitute allows Primal Groudon to block Intimidate and Spore while also giving it more freedom to attack, as it can safely sponge a hit from Primal Kyogre or opposing Primal Groudon that it would not have been able to otherwise. 108 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Primal Groudon will always survive an Earth Power from opposing Modest Primal Groudon, while 148 Attack EVs let Primal Groudon always OHKO 4 HP Mega Rayquaza at -1 Defense with Dragon Claw.</p> <p>Bulky Primal Groudon typically plays games at a slower pace because it isn't sweeping everything in a matter of turns, so pairing it with Pokemon like Incineroar, Tapu Fini, and Amoonguss, which thrive in this playstyle, is advised. A Pokemon to help with the Primal Groudon mirror match is advised, usually in the form of Mega Salamence or Groundium Z Landorus-T + Mega Gengar, as the former can wall it outright, while the latter can trap and remove it with Tectonic Rage. Primal Groudon is a great partner for Xerneas and Ultra Necrozma, as it can remove Incineroar, Mega Metagross, and Celesteela.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Eruption is Primal Groudon's best way to deal damage quickly, 2HKOing anything that doesn't resist Fire when at full power. Earth Power complements Eruption by hitting common Fire-resistant Pokemon like Incineroar and opposing Primal Groudon, but it's important to chip Incineroar into KO range; otherwise, its 50% Berry will be activated should it be holding one. Overheat is another extremely powerful Fire-type STAB move Primal Groudon makes perfect use of, as it can OHKO Xerneas before it boosts with Geomancy and isn't reliant on its remaining HP unlike Eruption. Roar trades the attacking option to be a one-time check to boosted Xerneas, as it can take the Moonblast and then phaze it. Protect is necessary for conserving HP and keeping Primal Groudon safe from faster attackers for a turn, including Z-Move users like Lunala and Ultra Necrozma. Hidden Power Ice has limited usefulness, but it is justifiable for hitting Mega Salamence and Mega Rayquaza. A Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs is generally preferred to be as fast as possible, ensuring you Speed tie at worst with opposing Primal Groudon, but running Modest nets a guaranteed OHKO on 4 HP Xerneas with Overheat, as well as way better rolls on bulky Primal Groudon with Earth Power.</p> <p>Because special attacking Primal Groudon focuses on Speed and power rather than bulk, it plays better on fast-paced teams that match its tempo. This is typically in the form of Mega Kangaskhan and Tornadus, which open games fast with Fake Out and Tailwind to get the ball rolling. Mega Salamence can also be a great partner for it, as it checks opposing Primal Groudon. Xerneas and Ultra Necrozma enjoy its ability to threaten Steel-types, though the latter prefers physical Primal Groudon more often due to it matching up better against Incineroar.</p>"

  "Rayquaza": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Rayquaza is a powerful Pokemon in the metagame thanks to its monstrous offensive stats, high Speed that lets it outrun the crowded base 90 Speed tier, and excellent movepool, which make it strong against a majority of the format. Unlike other Mega Evolutions, Mega Rayquaza has a lot of flexibility with its movesets, leaving opponents guessing about its set and item and making it well worth the Restricted slot. It has a good offensive typing, commonly utilizing Dragon Ascent to threaten a majority of the format for neutral or super effective damage, such as Primal Groudon, Amoonguss, and Incineroar, which are generally slow and cannot threaten -1 Mega Rayquaza back for much damage barring a Dragon Claw from Groudon. Mega Rayquaza can also utilize coverage moves like Earth Power, Crunch, Waterfall, and Draco Meteor, which allows it to threaten super effective damage onto a multitude of Pokemon that it would otherwise hit neutrally such as Primal Groudon, Lunala, and Mega Salamence. Mega Rayquaza's diverse toolkit also allows it to play a supportive role thanks to the likes of Icy Wind and Tailwind in addition to its ability to nullify the effects of weather via Air Lock before Mega Evolving. Despite its overwhelming BST and diverse movepool, Mega Rayquaza can struggle against Pokemon like Incineroar and Salamence if it doesn't have the proper coverage moves or Swords Dance to counteract repeated Attack drops from Intimidate. It is also threatened by the format's offensive Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele, as well as surprise tech options like Dragon Claw or Hidden Power Ice on Primal Groudon, depending on its moveset, or Ice Beam on Lunala. Mega Rayquaza is still relatively frail in comparison to other Restricted Pokemon as well and, in combination with the stat drops from Dragon Ascent, can be knocked out quickly if not supported adequately.</p>",

Alternatively, Overheat allows Mega Rayquaza to threaten Mega Metagross and Ferrothorn, which are critical targets to weaken for Primal Kyogre. Extreme Speed allows Mega Rayquaza to pick off weakened targets or get a last-ditch attack in before fainting. Focus Sash allows Mega Rayquaza to survive any single attack from full HP, potentially allowing it to get two attacks off thanks to its high Speed. Life Orb is an alternative item that raises Mega Rayquaza's already great damage output to terrifying levels, allowing it to OHKO 4 HP variants of Primal Groudon and Tapu Koko with Earth Power and Primal Kyogre with Dragon Ascent. The Speed EVs let Mega Rayquaza outspeed maximum Speed Jolly Mega Lucario after Mega Evolving.</p> <p>Mega Rayquaza pairs well with Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre and Xerneas, helping remove one of their better checks in Amoonguss. It also cancels out Primal Groudon's Desolate Land for Primal Kyogre before Mega Evolving with Air Lock and pressures OHKOs on Stakataka, Nihilego, and potentially Primal Groudon for Xerneas, letting it use its Fairy-type moves unmatched. It also helps chip down Incineroar into KO range from a +2 Moonblast for Xerneas. Xerneas, in turn, deals with opposing Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma, which can be tough for Mega Rayquaza to deal with.</p>"

Dragon Ascent hits a majority of the format for neutral damage and combined with Swords Dance matches the power of some of the strongest attacks in the game, like Ultra Necrozma's Light That Burns The Sky. Physically frail Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre and Amoonguss are prime targets. Extreme Speed combined with Swords Dance is capable of picking off Pokemon weakened by Dragon Ascent, such as Xerneas, Tapu Koko, and Ultra Necrozma, which would otherwise threaten Mega Rayquaza thereafter. The Speed EVs allow Mega Rayquaza to outspeed Mega Metagross, Mega Kangaskhan, and Nihilego, and the bulk allows it to survive attacks like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Moonblast.</p> <p>Swords Dance Mega Rayquaza pairs well with Primal Kyogre, as it nullifies Primal Groudon's Desolate Land and threatens an OHKO on Amoonguss. Kyogre helps break down Primal Groudon in return, which this Mega Rayquaza variant cannot deal with well without a Swords Dance boost. Mega Rayquaza appreciates partners such as Incineroar and Light Screen Tapu Fini that provide opportunities for it to set up with Swords Dance. Nihilego is another helpful partner because it checks Xerneas well. Fairium Z variants of Tapu Koko also make for good partners, as they can outrun and OHKO Mega Salamence and Ultra Necrozma, which would otherwise outspeed and threaten massive damage onto Mega Rayquaza.</p>"

It frequently finds its way onto any and every team composition, as it is blessed with an insane toolkit of Fake Out, Intimidate, U-turn, and Roar, providing so much for so little opportunity cost. Incineroar is the perfect Pokemon to enable VGC 2019's top threats, supporting Xerneas with Fake Out and Intimidate, pivoting in and out to help Primal Kyogre win the weather war against Primal Groudon, or using Roar on an opposing Xerneas to stop its sweep. What Incineroar does best, though, is making sure matches aren't just outmuscling your opponent, since its toolkit naturally requires games to play at a slower pace. The importance of Intimidate cannot be understated, as VGC 2019 is full of strong physical attackers like Mega Rayquaza, Primal Groudon, and Mega Salamence; as such, it is often momentum-shifting to turn an OHKO from one of these juggernauts into a 2HKO. It also adds a key Ghost resistance to many teams looking to improve their matchups against Lunala and Mega Gengar, as well as Fire-type coverage to ensure that any team can hit Ferrothorn and Celesteela. However, Incineroar is not without flaws; notably, its typing gives it two detrimental weaknesses to Ground and Water, meaning it matches up negatively against both Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. Additionally, it has to invest heavily in Special Defense if it wants to take on Xerneas, meaning Incineroar's offensive presenceâ€”and overall performanceâ€”are typically only as good as the Pokemon it enables.</p>",

Flare Blitz is Incineroar's main attacking option, which heavily damages Amoonguss, Kartana, and Mega Metagross. U-turn lets it pivot out and come back later in the game for additional Intimidate and Fake Out support. Knock Off balances power with utility, as it hits decently hard while removing items from foes, namely Figy Berry and the rest of the 50% recovery Berries. Snarl works well for lowering the damage output of special attackers like Lunala, Ultra Necrozma, and Tapu Koko. 236 HP and Special Defense EVs let Incineroar always survive Xerneas's +2 Moonblast, allowing Incineroar to phaze it with Roar or threaten it offensively with Flare Blitz. If using Assault Vest, an EV spread of 252 HP / 164 Atk / 92 SpD should be used instead, as it cleanly survives +2 Moonblast while also taking Origin Pulse from standard Primal Kyogre in rain.</p> <p>It is not a stretch to say that Incineroar can fit on every team composition in the metagame; its toolkit is just that valuable for any archetype, as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre appreciate its pivoting to help win weather wars, Xerneas and Mega Rayquaza have a much easier time setting up with Fake Out and Intimidate support, and Lunala and Ultra Necrozma get a switch-in to Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom or Light That Burns the Sky for the mirror matchups. One important usage tip is that Incineroar very much likes to pivot in and out of the battlefield often, so only stay in and attack with moves that are not U-turn or Fake Out when absolutely necessary.</p>"

Darkest Lariat also has the benefit of outdamaging Knock Off against Mega Evolved Pokemon, Z-Move users, Primal Kyogre, and Primal Groudon. U-turn lets Incineroar safely pivot to partners that can more appropriately handle the current situation, being particularly useful for weather wars, bringing in Steel-types on Xerneas, or granting additional Intimidate support against Primal Groudon. Flare Blitz hits Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Xerneas, while Roar lets Incineroar force out Geomancy-boosted Xerneas and Trick Room users like Stakataka and Lunala. 156 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature always let Incineroar OHKO Lunala at -1 with Malicious Moonsault, while 252 HP and 100 Special Defense EVs allow it to survive standard Xerneas's Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p>Since Incineroar invests offensively to be an effective Z-Move user, it loses out on the relevant Special Defense investment to make it a solid Xerneas check. Because of this, it should be paired with Pokemon such as bulky Primal Groudon, Haze Tapu Fini, and Stakataka, which all give Xerneas a hard time. It also loses to both Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, and it is frequently paired with Mega Salamence and Kartana as a result. It can also work on Kyogre-based teams, but it is advised to pair it with Mega Metagross and a second source of Fairy resistance, which is still a solid enough means of checking Xerneas.</p>"
