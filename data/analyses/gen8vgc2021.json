        "description": "<p>Zacian-C is the the best Restricted Pokemon in Series 11 due to its sky-high Attack stat, great Speed, and great defensive typing. Behemoth Blade is an excellent STAB move that is able to punish Dynamax-reliant Pokemon like Venusaur and Thundurus. Sacred Sword and Close Combat maul threats that resist Behemoth Blade like Kyogre, Urshifu-S, and mainly Incineroar, which a Fairy-type STAB move wouldn't be as effective against. Sacred Sword is weaker, but its ability to get around Max Steelspike's boosts keeps it optimal, while Close Combat is an explosive attack that can OHKO physically defensive Incineroar at +1. Substitute protects Zacian-C from status conditions and Intimidate while punishing passive plays; meanwhile, Swords Dance allow Zacian-C to keep its offensive presence even after getting crippled by Intimidate and Max Wyrmwind. The Adamant nature optimizes the Attack gain from Intrepid Sword and Swords Dance, while the Speed EVs allow it to outspeed even Venusaur in sun while at +1. Its good bulk allows it to survive Venusaur's Max Quake and opposing Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, and with dual screens support it can even survive Landorus-T's Max Quake and Venusaur's Max Flare.</p> <p>Grimmsnarl's dual screens and speed control in Scary Face allow Zacian-C to more safely pressure targets like opposing Zacian-C, Groudon, Venusaur, and Landorus-T. Thundurus can punish Intimidate from Incineroar while also boosting Zacian-C's Speed and Attack with its Max Airstream and Max Knuckle. Venusaur, Charizard, and Coalossal are all great early residual damage inflicters thanks to their G-Max Moves, which can put foes in range of Zacian-C's hits during the endgame. Landorus-T and Incineroar can stack Intimidate drops against threats like Groudon and opposing Landorus-T, protecting Zacian-C from physical attacks, while also being good Venusaur checks. Zacian-C also greatly appreciates Lapras's G-Max Resonance and its ability to OHKO Fire- and Ground-types like Landorus-T and Incineroar.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Venusaur's fantastic coverage, offensive typing, Chlorophyll, and access to G-Max Vine Lash turn it into one of the best Pokemon in the metagame. Frenzy Plant gives Venusaur the most powerful G-Max Vine Lash possible, but it trades flexibility outside of Dynamax by needing a turn to recharge. Leaf Storm, on the other hand, is a slightly less powerful Max Move and decreases Venusaur's Special Attack, but it's more flexible outside of Dynamax. Sleep Powder can disrupt the opposition and lets Venusaur potentially take the upper hand in unfavorable matchups. Weather Ball allows Venusaur to make use of the weather setup by Pokemon it's nearly always used alongside. When paired with Groudon or Torkoal, Venusaur gets Max Flare, which has a roll to OHKO most Zacian-C, and when paired with Kyogre, it gets Max Geyser, allowing it to slam Fire-types like Incineroar and Charizard. Earth Power turns into Max Quake, allowing Venusaur to threaten a KO onto Coalossal after fairly minimal prior damage and lets Venusaur boost its Special Defense. Sludge Bomb turns into Max Ooze, allowing Venusaur to boost its teams Special Attack, and it hits Grimmsnarl for a hefty amount of damage. With Life Orb and a Modest nature, Venusaur has the ability to 2HKO Rotom-H with G-Max Vine Lash and OHKO Zacian-C with Max Flare. Coba Berry improves Venusaur's matchup against Flying-types such as Landorus-T and Thundurus. Focus Sash helps against Pokemon such as Coalossal and Charizard, allowing Venusaur to threaten them with Sleep Powder after surviving any hit. When running Weakness Policy, consider running a bulkier EV spread such as 132 HP / 44 Def / 76 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, which survives Thundurus's Life Orb-boosted Max Airstream unless it gets the highest possible roll. This spread also pairs especially well with dual screens support to survive powerful super effective attacks under Dynamax, (RC) and retaliate harder. A Timid nature allows Venusaur to outspeed Regieleki and +1 Thundurus under sun, whereas Modest removes these luxuries but allows Venusaur to score more OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as G-Max Vine Lash 2HKOing Rotom-H after the residual damage from the move and Life Orb-boosted Max Quake scoring an OHKO onto Gigantamax Coalossal.</p> <p>Due to Chlorophyll, Venusaur pairs well with Pokemon that are able to easily set sun for it, such as Groudon and Torkoal. Paired with Groudon, Venusaur is able to check Water-types such as Rotom-W and Kyogre that threaten Groudon, while Groudon is able to threaten Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Incineroar, and Charizard that threaten Venusaur. Torkoal, on the other hand, is the best non-Restricted Pokemon to set sun for Venusaur, freeing the team to run another dangerous Restricted Pokemon such as Zacian-C or Kyogre, and it can provide additional support with Yawn or Burning Jealousy. Venusaur also pairs well with another beneficiary of the sun in Charizard because it's oftentimes able to weaken the opposition with its sheer power, allowing Venusaur to clean up. Kyogre is an amazing partner for Venusaur; although contradictory to Chlorophyll being a rain setter, it's able to take advantage of Venusaurâ€™s Max Ooze boosts and threaten Fire-types that Venusaur struggles against. Grimmsnarl is capable of setting dual screens to help Venusaur's fairly mediocre bulk and can provide speed control with Scary Face or Thunder Wave, leaving Venusaur not completely reliant on sun. Venusaur pairs excellently alongside Porygon2 for its ability to help handle threats to Venusaur such as Landorus-T with Ice Beam and weaken Rotom-H via Eerie Impulse. Landorus-T can also be a nice teammate for Venusaur, being able to threaten opposing Charizard and Rotom-H with Rock-type coverage.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gigantamax Charizard is among the metagames best Pokemon for its ability to melt nearly everything under sun, access to G-Max Wildfire, and positive matchups versus other common Pokemon such as Venusaur and Zacian-C. Due to Heat Wave's spread move status and Charizard's power, its generally the best option for it to use outside of Dynamax, and during Dynamax it grants Charizard access to G-Max Wildfire and its incredibly powerful residual effect. Hurricane grants Charizard the strongest Max Airstream, allowing it to boost its Speed and snowball with its immense power. Hurricane's poor accuracy in the sun isn't much of a problem, since Charizard rarely needs to use it outside of Dynamax. Alternatively, Air Slash is a decent alternative option that gives Charizard a move with greater consistency; however, the situations where Air Slash is better than Hurricane are niche, but the additional power Hurricane grants is also fairly niche. Blast Burn grants Charizard the strongest possible G-Max Wildfire, making it capable of OHKOing Porygon2 when holding Life Orb under sun. Due to Blast Burn's recharge penalty, its only reasonably justifiable to run it alongside another Fire-type move. Ancient Power is specifically useful to take out opposing Charizard with Max Rockfall, though Max Rockfall does replace sun and weakens Charizard significantly. Scorching Sands gives Charizard access to Max Quake, which destroys Dynamaxed Coalossal under sun, one of the few Pokemon it fails to very meaningfully threaten otherwise, and it's also useful for boosting Charizard's Special Defense. Life Orb grants Charizard cataclysmic levels of power, allowing it to OHKO both Incineroar and Dynamaxed Landorus-T under sun with G-Max Wildfire and Max Quake, respectively. Safety Goggles is immensely useful for an immunity to Venusaur's Sleep Powder. Lum Berry protects Charizard from the aforementioned Sleep Powder as well as Thunder Wave from support Thundurus and Grimmsnarl, but the downside of being a one-time use leaves Charizard susceptible to being hit by multiple status moves after it's been used. Assault Vest is another good option to improve Charizard's matchup versus special attackers such as Regieleki, Calyrex-S, and opposing Charizard. With Assault Vest, consider a bulkier EV spread such as 4 HP / 4 Def / 188 SpA / 60 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, which survives Dynamaxed Regieleki's Max Lightning. Wacan Berry is a niche option that helps against Regieleki and Thundurus, though Charizard's other options are generally more useful.</p> <p>Charizard's longing to be under sun makes Drought Pokemon such as Groudon and Torkoal great teammates. Torkoal is the best non-Restricted Pokemon to set sun, freeing the team to run another dangerous Restricted Pokemon, usually Zacian-C. Venusaur is phenomenal alongside Charizard, as both love being under sun, with Venusaur checking some of Charizard's biggest threats like Regieleki and Kyogre. Regieleki is another great teammate to Charizard for being one of best answers to Kyogre teams and providing speed control with Electroweb. Ground-types such as Groudon and Landorus-T make good partners for Charizard, as they check Coalossal effectively, while Charizard can tackle common Ice- and Grass-types such as Calyrex-I, Rillaboom, and Kartana. Charizard pairs well with Grimmsnarl thanks to its dual screens support helping with Charizard's mediocre bulk, and it can also provide Charizard speed control via Thunder Wave or Scary Face. Prankster Pokemon with access to Sunny Day such as Sableye and Whimsicott can be used in lieu of a Drought Pokemon, both providing the weather and speed control that Charizard demands.</p>"

Blastoise is able to dish out large amounts of damage with G-Max Cannonade's powerful residual effect, and Hydro Cannon gives Blastoise the strongest possible G-Max Cannonade, and being inflexible outside of Dynamax doesn't matter much since Blastoise often is the one Dynamaxing on the team. Blizzard gives Blastoise the strongest possible Max Hailstorm against threats such as Venusaur, Dragapult, and Rillaboom, 2HKOing Dynamaxed Dragapult. Ice Beam can be used for more consistency outside of Dynamax, which is especially relevant given that the hail set by Max Hailstorm is often replaced, leaving Blizzard inaccurate. Blastoise can pressure Dynamaxed Pokemon with Yawn reliably thanks to its natural bulk, threatening to waste their Dynamax turns. Fake Out, Helping Hand, and Terrain Pulse are all more niche options that can be run over preferably Protect but also Yawn. Fake Out gives Blastoise's teammates opportunities to set up or get a strong attack off. Helping Hand allows Blastoise to boost the power of its teammates such as Zacian-C unimpeded due to its high priority. Terrain Pulse allows Blastoise to hit Water-types such as Kyogre, Gastrodon, and opposing Blastoise super effectively when paired with Rillaboom's Grassy Surge. Aqua Jet is an alternative option over Yawn on Coalossal teams so that Blastoise can best position itself to activate Coalossal's Weakness Policy and Steam Engine. Wacan Berry improves Blastoise's matchup against Regieleki and offensive Thundurus. Alternatively, Life Orb boosts Blastoise's damage output immensely, enabling it to 2HKO Gigantamax Venusaur and Dynamaxed Rillaboom with Max Hailstorm. Blastoise's given Speed investment outspeeds paralyzed Calyrex-S and also outspeeds it at +2, both of which are relevant given that support Thundurus and Landorus-T that can boost its Speed with Max Airstream are common partners.</p> <p>Blastoise is most commonly paired with Zacian-C to pressure Pokemon such as Incineroar, Rotom-H, and Landorus-T for it, while Zacian-C checks Rillaboom for Blastoise. Furthermore, the residual damage from G-Max Cannonade can set Zacian-C up to sweep late-game. Incineroar checks Grass-types such as Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Rillaboom and offers Blastoise Fake Out pressure. Grimmsnarl's dual screens support and speed control allow Blastoise to pressure foes more easily. Support Thundurus pairs similarly well with Blastoise, as it can provide speed control and support in Eerie Impulse to help Blastoise better take on threats such as Venusaur and Regieleki. Landorus-T is very frequently paired with Blastoise, as it checks Regieleki and Grass-types. Rillaboom smacks Water-types such as Gastrodon, Tapu Fini, and Kyogre, which Blastoise struggles to damage. Coalossal deals with threats to Blastoise like Thundurus and Venusaur, and Blastoise in return can check Ground-type threats to Coalossal like Landorus-T, as well as activate Coalossal's Weakness Policy and Steam Engine via Aqua Jet.</p>"

Foul Play takes advantage of the high Attack stats of Restricted Pokemon and deals very acceptable damage to them, such as on Groudon and Calyrex-I. Snarl allows Umbreon to slow down strong specially attacking threats such as Calyrex-S and Kyogre. Yawn makes Umbreon demand respect unlike most other defensive Pokemon, as sleep is generally an oppressive mechanic and can also completely shut down Dynamax for at least a turn, forcing the Pokemon to switch out in order to prevent it and wasting their Dynamax. Moonlight semi-reliably heals 2/3 of Umbreon's HP under sun, which is fantastic for a defensive Pokemon that is usually paired with Groudon. Moonlight can prove to help Umbreon win against Pokemon such as Calyrex-S and Kyogre under sun due to being able to play a very long game with them, 2HKOing the former and slowly chipping the latter down. Helping Hand allows Umbreon to bypass its lack of offensive presence by powering up an ally such as Groudon. Protect helps Umbreon stall opposing Dynamax turns more effectively. Sitrus Berry allows Umbreon to heal off a good amount of damage immediately, while Leftovers allows it to play the slow game when healing alongside Protect or Moonlight. The EV spread allows Umbreon to always survive Modest Kyogre's Water Spout under rain and Brave Calyrex-I's Max Hailstorm.</p> <p>Umbreon appreciates partners such as Groudon that can set sun, helping Umbreon heal a substantial amount with Moonlight, and Umbreon in turn gives Groudon room to set up with Swords Dance via Yawn and can shoot its damage up even higher with Helping Hand. Charizard is another good Umbreon partner that also loves being in the sun. It offsets Umbreon's weakness to Zacian-C and both Urshifu formes with its G-Max Wildfire and Max Airstream, respectively. Grimmsnarl makes Umbreon even more problematic by bolstering its bulk via dual screens support and serves as a secondary check to both Urshifu formes.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Porygon2 is the metagame's best Trick Room setter with its incredible bulk, mere one weakness, and ability to keep top-tier Pokemon at bay, such as Calyrex-S and Landorus-T. Trick Room is invaluable speed control for almost any team, and Porygon2 sets Trick Room reliably thanks to its immense bulk. Recover gives Porygon2 longevity, letting it stall out Dynamax turns and potentially help it serve as a late-game wincon, outlasting foes. Eerie Impulse is immensely useful to impede the metagame's various special attackers such as Calyrex-S, Rotom-H, and Kyogre. Tri Attack is oftentimes less critical than Porygon2's other options, but its the best option versus Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Incineroar that aren't vulnerable to Porygon2's coverage or Eerie Impulse. Ice Beam makes Porygon2 one of the best checks to one of the metagame's most potent threats, Landorus-T, and it also deals decent damage to the likes of Groudon and Venusaur. Foul Play allows Porygon2 to threaten a 2HKO onto Calyrex-S and hit boosted Weakness Policy users such as Solgaleo, Calyrex-I, and Metagross quite hard. Download is good because it gives Porygon2 a Special Attack boost pretty often, considering common Pokemon such as Incineroar, both Urshifu formes, and Landorus-T have higher Defense stats. Trace should only be run if Porygon2 chooses Eerie Impulse and Foul Play as its last two moves. Trace will be more advantageous than disadvantageous most of the time, mainly due to the potential of copying Intimidate from users such as Incineroar and Landorus-T. Thunderbolt is an option for Porygon2's third moveslot, giving Porygon2 BoltBeam coverage with Ice Beam and allowing it to more immediately threaten the likes of Charizard, Blastoise, and Kyogre, and unlike Eerie Impulse, its not shut down by Taunt. However, its overall less useful then Eerie Impulse. Note that when running Thunderbolt, Porygon2 should elect for a Modest nature to best make use of its BoltBeam coverage. Icy Wind is alternative speed control over Trick Room, though oftentimes Trick Room is simply going to be more valuable. Shadow Ball has the advantage over Foul Play of being able to OHKO Calyrex-S after a Download boost, but it's worse versus boosted Weakness Policy users. Ally Switch is an option over one of the last two moveslots, giving Porygon2 the ability to redirect attacks from its teammates, though its incredibly difficult to justify Ally Switch due to it taking a valuable slot. A physically defensive EV spread is preferred for Porygon2 to better set Trick Room in the face of powerful physical attackers such as Urshifu-S and Zacian-C, and the given EVs allow Porygon2 to survive Adamant Zacian-C's Close Combat with the remainder thrown into Special Defense. A specially defensive EV spread such as 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD with a Sassy nature is also a good option, which allows Porygon2 to live extremely powerful special attacks such as Calyrex-S's Helping Hand- and Life Orb-boosted Max Mindstorm and Kyogre's Mystic Water-boosted 150 BP Max Geyser. A Modest nature with some Special Attack investment can make Porygon2 notably more threatening with a Download boost, though this of course compromises its bulk.</p> <p>Porygon2 makes a great fit on sun teams with either Torkoal or Groudon alongside Venusaur because they greatly appreciate its role compression as a check to Landorus-T with Ice Beam, as well as Calyrex-S and Rotom-H with Eerie Impulse. Furthermore, the combination of Porygon2 with the aforementioned Pokemon is quite flexible between Porygon2's ability to set Trick Room or swap into a Drought setter to activate Venusaur's Chlorophyll, which has the threat of both Dynamax and Sleep Powder at its disposal. Incineroar pairs extremely well with Porygon2 with its Fake Out capable of helping it set Trick Room. Other good Restricted Pokemon to pair with Porygon2 are Kyogre and Zacian-C, the former being a heavy hitter that can benefit greatly from Trick Room and the latter appreciating its ability to check Landorus-T.</p>"

Download and Analytic activate fairly consistently, and alongside Special Attack investment and occasionally Dynamax Porygon2 can be a threat in of itself. Tri Attack is simply a consistent STAB move, whereas Hyper Beam gives Porygon2 the strongest possible Max Strike, though it's less flexible outside of Dynamax and Porygon2 tends to stay on the field for a long time. Shadow Ball threatens Calyrex-S, one of the metagame's most dangerous Pokemon. Ice Beam on the other hand lethally threatens Landorus-T and deals good damage to the likes of Groudon and Venusaur. Running either Trick Room or Icy Wind is invaluable for speed control and should be used respectively of which would benefit your team more. Recover is incredibly useful, granting Porygon2 longevity and allowing it to serve as a late-game wincon by outlasting foes and stalling out Dynamax turns. Alternatively, Ally Switch allows Porygon2 to redirect attacks from its partners, but this gives up Recover's longevity. Thunderbolt is a coverage option that slams the likes of Charizard, Tapu Fini, and Blastoise fairly hard, though its difficult to justify over Porygon2's generally more important coverage options. Download should be used if Porygon2 has Trick Room, and it should instead have Analytic instead when running Icy Wind, as Analytic will not consistently activate under Trick Room.</p> <p>Porygon2 is generally seen on compositions with Zacian-C, Gigantamax Lapras, and sometimes Grimmsnarl. Offensive Porygon2 compromises its bulk, so dual screens setters such as the aforementioned Gigantamax Lapras and Grimmsnarl are good partners. The former has a great Landorus-T matchup, freeing Porygon2 from running Ice Beam, while the latter also packs other useful support moves like Fake Tears to help Porygon2. Note that Lapras and Grimmsnarl can be run together, but Grimmsnarl should not be running dual screens when doing so.</p>"

In a metagame that relies heavily on weather, Drought allows Torkoal to cause trouble for teams based on rain. Burning Jealousy hits common Steel-types such as Zacian-C and Solgaleo while threatening a burn on physical attackers that tend to boost their stats with Max Moves, such as Landorus-T and Thundurus. Body Press takes advantage of Torkoal's high Defense stat, allowing it to ignore Intimidate and heavily damage Incineroar. Yawn allows Torkoal to threaten to waste opposing Dynamax turns and slow down the momentum of opposing strategies thanks to its good bulk. The EV spread allows Torkoal to survive three +1 Sacred Swords from Zacian-C, a +1 Earth Power from Venusaur, and a Wicked Blow from Choice Band Urshifu-S.</p> <p>Zacian-C is Torkoal's most common Restricted partner, which takes care of Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Urshifu-S against which Torkoal can't do much. Torkoal in turn handles opposing Zacian-C. Torkoal is very commonly paired with Charizard and almost always with Venusaur as Drought allows the former to deal very large amounts of damage with its powerful Solar Power-boosted G-Max Wildfires and the latter to fire off fast Sleep Powders and G-Max Vinelashes. In the case of a team with a Trick Room setter, Whimsicott and Calyrex-I are good partners for Torkoal, as Burning Jealousy will always burn against Zacian-C since it burns Pokemon that have had a stat boost, allowing Calyrex-I to better resist Behemoth Blade.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Through the combination of Charcoal, Drought, and STAB Eruption, Torkoal is capable of acting as one of the most powerful Trick Room sweepers in the Series 11 metagame. Eruption is an incredibly powerful option for Torkoal, especially since under Trick Room it will almost always act first, allowing it to act as a mini-Kyogre and fire off a 150 BP STAB weather-boosted spread move, OHKOing even the bulkiest of Zacian-C and heavily damaging Dynamaxed Calyrex-I. Consequently, offensive Torkoal tend to opt for Charcoal as their item instead of Life Orb, since they will almost always be using Fire-type moves and do not want to reduce Eruption damage with Life Orb recoil. Charcoal Torkoal often opts for a second spread Fire-type move as an alternative choice for after it has been weakened enough to meaningfully reduce Eruption damage. Heat Wave is the most common choice due to its superior power, but some offensive Torkoal will opt for Burning Jealousy instead due to its perfect accuracy and ability to work as a support option against leads such as Zacian-C and Defiant Thundurus. However, a major downside for Burning Jealousy is that it runs the risk of missing out on KOs that Heat Wave would be able to reach, such as against Zacian-C with 4 HP EVs. To round out the moveset, many Charcoal Torkoal opt for Earth Power as a means of providing an attacking option against Incineroar, Coalossal, and opposing Torkoal, while others choose to run Yawn to put pressure on Dynamax Pokemon and provide a supportive option if Torkoal has its Special Attack dropped or if the weather gets changed from sun. While Charcoal is typically the preferred item for offensive Torkoal, which will run Protect as the fourth move, some opt to instead run Choice Specs in order to maximize the power of Eruption and will use a fourth attacking move instead of Protect such as Solar Beam.</p> <p>Due to having one of the lowest Speed stats in the metagame, offensive Torkoal excels on teams that are either wholly dedicated to Trick Room or have a strong Trick Room option. Consequently, it is almost always paired with one of the three common non-Restricted Trick Room setters in the format: Porygon2, Mimikyu, and Dusclops. Common Restricted partners for offensive Torkoal are those that excel in Trick Room, such as Calyrex-I and Necrozma-DM, although it is also possible to use offensive Torkoal on teams using a Restricted Pokemon such as Zacian-C alongside a Trick Room mode. Many teams using offensive Torkoal will also opt to run Gigantamax Venusaur, giving the team an alternative \"fast mode\" where Torkoal can both support the incredibly strong Gigantamax Venusaur outside of Trick Room and act as a Trick Room attacker during different phases of the match. Some teams will opt to go all in on sun and run Gigantamax Charizard alongside, or instead of, Venusaur to provide massive damage potential with double sun-boosted attacks.</p>"

Origin Pulse is a powerful, although inaccurate, backup to Water Spout after Kyogre has been harmed, while Scald is a weaker but consistent option with a chance to burn threats like Zacian-C. Ice Beam is mainly useful for Max Hailstorm, to let Kyogre best contend with the likes of Gigantamaxed Venusaur and Dynamaxed Dragapult, threatening a 2HKO on both. Alternatively, Thunder hits opposing Kyogre and turns into Max Lightning, blocking Yawn from Umbreon and Spore from Amoonguss but leaving Kyogre more vulnerable to Grass-types. Mystic Water boosts Kyogre's Water-type attacks with no drawbacks, as opposed to Life Orb's recoil lowering Water Spout's damage. A Timid nature allows Kyogre to outspeed Calyrex-S and Zacian-C at +1 from Tornadus's Max Airstream, as well outspeed them when they are at -1 from Regieleki's Electroweb, while Modest lets Kyogre OHKO Thundurus with Water Spout while also having a chance to OHKO Zacian-C.</p> <p>Tornadus is a staple partner to Kyogre, as it can offer speed control with Tailwind and Max Airstream and check Grass-types such as Venusaur and Rillaboom.

Venusaur, although near requiring the support of the anti-synergistic Torkoal, is an amazing partner for Kyogre, as it checks Regieleki well, while Kyogre can help deal with Ground- and Fire-types such as Landorus-T and Incineroar. Grimmsnarl's dual screens support and speed control help Kyogre pressure the opponent more safely. Porygon2 can weaken threats to Kyogre such as Zapdos and Venusaur with Eerie Impulse and set Trick Room, meaning Kyogre should exchange its speed for bulk if paired with it.

        "description": "<p>In a metagame where Restricted Pokemon run rampant and the premier teams are sun teams, Groudon is easily a top contender. While Groudon is certainly threatening by itself, it's so good more because Drought serves as a catalyst for two of the metagame's most dangerous Pokemon, those being Charizard and Venusaur. Precipice Blades is Groudon's strongest STAB move and gives it access to Max Quake to boost its weaker Special Defense. Groudon has more consistent STAB options, but there is simply too much opportunity cost to reasonably justify them. Rock Slide gives Groudon means to hit Flying-types such as Zapdos and Yveltal, and most critically it threatens an OHKO against Dynamaxed Charizard via Max Rockfall. Swords Dance is useful for offsetting Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T and Incineroar, and thanks to Groudon's bulk, it can oftentimes get one or even multiple boosts. Sitrus Berry improves Groudon's longevity as a bulky Swords Dance user and support Pokemon to Charizard and Venusaur. Alternatively, Groudon can run White Herb in order to offset Intimidate and make itself generally more threatening; however, Groudon oftentimes doesn't need to be more threatening because its teammates do that job. The given EV spread allows Groudon to outspeed -1 Thundurus and outspeed Tornadus while at +1, both of which are relevant given Groudon is often paired with Charizard, which can use Max Airstream, and Electroweb Regieleki.</p> <p>Groudon should always be paired with Venusaur and almost always with Charizard; there is simply little reason to not use Pokemon that are so powerful in the sun. Venusaur helps Groudon by thwarting Water-types such as Rotom-W, Blastoise, and Kyogre. In return, Groudon can thwart Fire-types like Incineroar and Coalossal. Charizard can assist Groudon by checking Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Venusaur, while Groudon can check Regieleki and Coalossal for Charizard. Regieleki is a great teammate for being one of the best answers to Kyogre teams, and it can also provide Groudon speed control with Electroweb. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens to bolster Groudon's already good defensive stats, which can help it set up with Swords Dance more safely. Grimmsnarl can also mitigate Groudon's middling Speed via Scary Face or Thunder Wave. Porygon2 is a great partner for Groudon because it's a great check to Landorus-T with Ice Beam, most importantly, and also Calyrex-S with Eerie Impulse, which are both Pokemon that can greatly trouble Groudon teams. Porygon2 can also provide speed control to Groudon with Trick Room. Incineroar supports pretty much every Pokemon well and Groudon is no exception, appreciating Incineroar's ability to keep the likes of Venusaur, Rillaboom, and Calyrex-S in check if it's running Assault Vest. Umbreon is one of the best answers to Calyrex-S and also a solid answer to Calyrex-I, both of which can greatly trouble Groudon and its common teammates. Note that running Umbreon gives up the ability to reasonably justify Porygon2, which compromises the matchup against Landorus-T.</p>"

Overheat is Rotom-H's strongest STAB move and, when Dynamaxed, becomes Max Flare, which sets sun, powering up Overheat and reducing the power of opposing Water-types like Kyogre and Tapu Fini. Nasty Plot allows Rotom-H to OHKO Pokemon like Landorus-T, Groudon, and Thundurus with boosted Max Flare, and it also compensates for Overheat's Special Attack drop. Ally Switch allows Rotom-H to redirect attacks like Zacian's Behemoth Blade or Venusaur's Sleep Powder to itself. Safety Goggles gives Rotom-H protection against Venusaur's and Amoonguss's powder moves, while Sitrus Berry provides some recovery; however, protection against Venusaur's Sleep Powder is usually preferred .</p> <p>Rotom-H fits best on Zacian-C teams that appreciate its ability to check sun threats like Venusaur and Charizard, as well as opposing Zacian-C. Landorus-T checks Coalossal for Rotom-H while Rotom-H checks opposing Ice-types like Calyrex-I. Both Landorus-T and Rotom check many of the same things like Venusaur, Charizard, and Zacian, giving it them flexibility and insurance against these threats. Rillaboom checks Water-types like Kyogre and appreciates Rotom-H's ability to check Zacian-C, Charizard, and Calyrex-I. Prankster Pokemon like Grimmsnarl and Thundurus reduce the damage Rotom-H takes from opponents with dual screens support and Eerie Impulse, and can provide it with speed control in the form of Scary Face and Thunder Wave. Gastrodon can protect Rotom-H from opposing Water-types such as Blastoise and Lapras with Storm Drain and check Landorus-T while Rotom-H checks common Grass-types like Venusaur and Rillaboom for it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Palkia, while certainly not the most popular Restricted Pokemon, definitely has a niche in Series 11 for its strong matchup against Kyogre teams, respectable bulk, and considerable offensive prowess. Palkia's STAB combination is excellent, as few Pokemon resist it; both Max Geyser and Max Wyrmwind are quite useful, as Max Geyser sets up rain and Max Wyrmwind lowers the Attack of opposing Pokemon, such as Calyrex-I and Zacian-C. Earth Power is a useful coverage move when Palkia is Dynamaxed, as Palkia can OHKO Zacian-C with Life Orb Max Quake, and it boosts Palkia's Special Defense. Trick Room can turn the tables in Palkia's favor when facing faster paced teams. Life Orb's stronger power boost is preferable because it also boosts Max Quake; however, if another teammate wants to run Life Orb, Lustrous Orb can be used instead. Palkia can also run more Speed investment, as it has a nice base 100 Speed stat, which is faster than Kyogre, Kyurem-W, Reshiram, and both Urshifu formes. However, a bulkier EV spread is usually preferred, as Palkia fits well on bulky Trick Room teams.</p> <p>Since Palkia struggles with Zacian-C, as well as Grass-types that are supported by Grimmsnarl's Light Screen like Venusaur and Amoonguss, it appreciates partners that can check the aforementioned Pokemon like Incineroar and Rotom-H, and they appreciate Palkia's ability to check Landorus-T and Kyogre in return. Regieleki appreciates Palkia checking Ground-types for it, and provides Palkia with speed control via Electroweb. Ferrothorn gives Palkia teams a strong win condition with Iron Defense and Body Press and appreciates Palkia's ability to check Fire-types for it. Grimmsnarl helps Palkia stay alive longer with dual screens, as well as providing speed control with either Scary Face or Thunder Wave. Porygon2 also provides speed control with Trick Room, allowing Palkia to more freely drop Trick Room in favor of Protect, and it can weaken opposing special attackers like Venusaur and Dialga with Eerie Impulse.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Being the fastest Prankster Pokemon in the game with a deep supportive movepool, Whimsicott establishes itself as one of the best utility Pokemon in the current metagame. Prankster allows Whimsicott to have a priority Tailwind, allowing it to boost its team's Speed against faster restricted Pokemon such as Zacian-C and Calyrex-S, while gen 8â€™s dynamic speed mechanics make Tailwind users like Whimsicott very potent. Moonblast is able to deal good damage to Fairy-weak Pokemon such as Urshifu-S. Taunt allows Whimsicott to prevent Trick Room from Porygon2 and Mimikyu as well as Venusaur's Sleep Powder, Amoonguss's Spore, and Rotom-H's Will-O-Wisp. Helping Hand allows Whimsicott to still play a supportive role while facing common Fake Out Pokemon like Incineroar and Rillaboom while also making up for Whimsicott's lack of offensive presence. Focus Sash allows Whimsicott to take a move which it wouldn't be able to. Alternatively, the combination of Switcheroo and Eject Button can be run to get rid of your opponent's Dynamax if properly timed.</p> <p>Whimsicott usually plays a supportive role on the team enabling common partners like Calyrex-S, Thundurus,and Charizard to excel with its supportive moves. Whimsicott is able to provide Tailwind and Cotton Spore for Calyrex-S while also keeping Dark-types such as Urshifu-S in check. Thundurus is able to take care of Incineroar for Whimsicott while Whimscott provides Helping Hand. Charizard and Whimsicott synergize well due to Whimsicott providing Charizard with Sunny Day and Fake Tears while Charizard keeps Zacian-C in check for Whimsicott.</p>"

Clear Smog resets the boosts of Geomancy Xerneas and Cosmic Power Eternatus. Amoonguss will always carry Rage Powder, redirecting powerful attacks such as Zacian's Behemoth Blade and Regieleki's Thunder away from its common allies like Xerneas and Kyogre. Spore is used to disrupt the enemy team with sleep while also breaking Trick Room setups. Other options are Pollen Puff to heal your own Pokemon and Grass Knot to hit Groudon and Kyogre hard. Amoonguss will usually carry a Mental Herb to shake off Taunt from threats such as Whimsicott, Tornadus, and Incineroar, but it can also run an Occa Berry to survive Groudon's Heat Crash, Volcarona's Overheat, and Incineroar's Flare Blitz and put them to sleep in return. Regenerator provides Amoonguss longevity, while its EV spread makes it survive a +1 Behemoth Blade from Zacian-C and a Hurricane from Tornadus, although it can never survive a Calyrex-S Expanding Force. Unfortunately, Amoonguss's low offensive presence makes it rely heavily on its partners to deal significant damage. This makes Volcarona and Rillaboom often preferred over it.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a great partner for Zacian-C and Xerneas, since both Pokemon appreciate its redirection and support for setting up or preserving their health. Kyogre is another good option, since its rain weakens Fire-type moves. Fire-types such as Entei and Incineroar are also appreciated, since they can power through opposing Grass-types like Rillaboom and Tsareena easily, which can disrupt Amoonguss because they're immune to Rage Powder and Spore. Landorus, Palkia, and Urshifu-R are other good allies to KO opposing Fire-type Pokemon such as Incineroar and Volcarona.</p>"

Hurricane is fully accurate under Kyogre's rain, and it allows Tornadus to boost its team's Speed with Max Airstream. Tailwind is invaluable speed control that is particularly strong alongside Kyogre, letting it outspeed and nearly 2HKO or OHKO the entire metagame. Heat Wave provides Max Flare, which immensely benefits Chlorophyll Venusaur. Dark Pulse gives Tornadus a means to OHKO Dynamaxed Calyrex-S with Max Darkness, and its Special Defense lowering effect can be taken advantage of by Kyogre. Icy Wind provides additional speed control, but it is harder to justify over other options.</p> <p>Tornadus should always be paired with Kyogre and helps it greatly by providing Tailwind and checking Grass-types such as Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Rillaboom. Typical partners to this pair include Venusaur to answer Regieleki, Torkoal to enable Chlorophyll Venusaur, and the support Pokemon Incineroar and Grimmsnarl. Note that on of the support Pokemon could instead be a more offensive Pokemon such as Choice Band Urshifu-S or Regieleki. The former is a powerful threat that benefits immensely from Tailwind, while the latter appreciates Tornadus checking Grass-types.</p>"

Hurricane is a powerful and consistent STAB move under Kyogre's rain that becomes Max Airstream, letting Tornadus boost its team's Speed. Tailwind is indispensable speed control that pairs really well with Water Spout Kyogre. Taunt allows Tornadus to shut down status moves from the likes of Porygon2, Amoonguss, and Venusaur. Icy Wind gives Tornadus additional speed control, potentially giving it the upper hand against opposing Tailwind teams. Rain Dance is useful against Drought setters like Groudon and Torkoal Wacan Berry specifically helps against Regieleki, a huge threat to Kyogre teams, while Mental Herb prevents Whimsicott from denying Tailwind with Prankster Taunt.</p> <p>Tornadus should almost always be paired with Kyogre because it lacks a niche outside Kyogre teams and Tornadus can support Kyogre by providing speed control and checking Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Venusaur. Tornadus and Kyogre are quite vulnerable to Regieleki, so answers to Regieleki such as Kartana and Venusaur make good partners. Note that Torkoal should be run alongside Venusaur to activate Chlorophyll. Tornadus is also great alongside Regieleki, as it can check troublesome Grass-types. Choice Band Urshifu-S is a powerful Pokemon that benefits immensely from Tornadus's Tailwind.</p>"

Eerie Impulse slows special attackers such as Kyogre and Zapdos. In a metagame where Tailwind and Max Airstream are so ubiquitous, Thunder Wave gives Thundurus a way to control Speed, permanently slowing down fast Pokemon such as Zacian-C. Alternatively, Scary Face is fully accurate and can lower Regieleki's and Landorus-T's Speed. Taunt shuts down status moves such as Spore and Rage Powder from Amoonguss, Sleep Powder from Venusaur, and Trick Room and Eerie Impulse from Porygon2. Leer is mainly used with Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade to OHKO Dynamaxed Pokemon such as Thundurus. Thunder Wave sets sometimes opt for Swagger to give targets a harder time moving, which is extremely potent in a Dynamax metagame. It can also be paired with allies such as Lum Berry Landorus-T to turn them into huge threats. Sitrus Berry helps improve Thundurus's longevity. The Defense investment allows Thundurus to survive +1 Zacian-C's Play Rough.</p> <p>Support Thundurus is commonly paired with Landorus-T for the bulk-improving combination of Intimidate and Eerie Impulse. Thundurus checks Water-types and helps Landorus-T with its Speed via Scary Face or Thunder Wave. Zacian-C is a common Restricted partner that appreciates Thundurus checking Water-types and giving it increased special bulk via Eerie Impulse. Blastoise has immense synergy with Thundurus because Eerie Impulse improves Blastoise's matchup against Regieleki, Thunder Wave or Scary Face helps Blastoise's Speed, and Blastoise threatens Landorus-T with G-Max Cannonade.</p>"

Wild Charge allows Thundurus to hit Pokemon such as Kyogre and Charizard for super effective damage. Superpower OHKOes Incineroar and turns into Max Knuckle under Dynamax, giving Thundurus and its allies like Zacian-C Attack boosts. Foul Play takes advantage of the high Attack stats of many Restricted Pokemon and turns into Max Darkness, allowing Dynamaxed Thundurus to OHKO Calyrex-S and get Special Defense drops on both foes to aid powerful special attacking allies such as Calyrex-S. Alternatively, Lash Out consistently OHKOes Calyrex-S and gives Thundurus further protection against stat drops. Note that Thundurus is usually only effective as a Dynamax option. The EV spread combined with the Assault Vest allows Dynamaxed Thundurus to always survive Mystic Water Kyogre's Water Spout and Life Orb Charizard's G-Max Wildfire, and the Defense investment does the same for Jolly Life Orb Landorus-T's Max Rockfall. The Special Defense investment allows Dynamaxed Thundurus to never get KOed by Electroweb from Timid Magnet Regieleki combined with Max Geyser from Mystic Water Kyogre in rain, and the Attack investment lets it OHKO standard Kyogre back with Max Lightning even without a Defiant boost. Life Orb alternatively lets Thundurus 2HKO bulky Dynamaxed Landorus-T with Max Airstream after a Defiant boost. Life Orb sets tend to drop Foul Play or Lash Out for Protect.</p> <p>Thundurus is frequently paired with Zacian-C thanks to its ability to punish Incineroar's and Landorus-T's Intimidate, enabling Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade by deterring them.

Zacian-C in return helps Thundurus beat Calyrex-I. Calyrex-S is another common Restricted partner that appreciates its ability to deter Incineroar and Urshifu-S and lower Special Defense via Max Darkness, allowing Calyrex-S to use its powerful Astral Barrage uncontested.

Most Rillaboom that aim to be more defensive opt to use Assault Vest in order to better survive attacks from some of the metagame's most potent threats like Kyogre and Calyrex-S. Grassy Glide in Grassy Terrain provides a strong priority attack that threatens heavy damage on Water-types like Kyogre and Blastoise and Ground-types like Groudon. Wood Hammer is often used as a secondary offensive option that can deal significant damage, while Knock Off is an alternative option that offers a more consistent answer to Calyrex-S and provides utility by removing items from Pokemon that depend on them such as Porygon2 and Dusclops. U-turn allows Rillaboom's teammates to pivot in safely, which is an especially effective option when paired with Assault Vest. Fake Out rounds out the set and allows Rillaboom to flinch an opposing Pokemon while its partner is free to set up or deal damage.

Coalossal runs Heat Wave as opposed to other Fire-type attacks for a strong spread damage option outside of Dynamax, threatening common Pokemon in the format such as Zacian-C, Amoonguss, and Venusaur. Max Flare also sets up sun to further boost its power. Meteor Beam provides Coalossal with the strongest G-Max Volcalith, threatening to OHKO metagame staples like Incineroar while also dealing 1/6th of both opposing Pokemon's health as passive chip damage. One of Solar Beam and Earth Power is chosen as a coverage move. The former is very useful to threaten bulky Water-types such as Kyogre and Gastrodon, OHKOing the former when it is not Dynamaxed. However, Earth Power allows Coalossal to OHKO the opposing Coalossal in a mirror matchup and turns into Max Quake under Dynamax, boosting Coalossal and its allies' Special Defense. Coalossal uses a Weakness Policy as its item of choice because in combination with the Speed boost from Steam Engine, Coalossal's Special Attack is also doubled, making it a formidable threat.</p> <p>Coalossal wants game plans centered around activating its Weakness Policy and sweeping opposing teams, or setting G-Max Volcalith and letting its partners do the rest. Common partners include Urshifu-R and Dragapult, which are among the best Pokemon to activate Coalossalâ€™s Weakness Policy with Aqua Jet or fast Surf, giving Coalossal the Steam Engine boost. Urshifu also helps Coalossal by providing strong damage that piles up as G-Max Volcalith turns go on and defeating common checks, such as Dynamaxed Landorus-T, with strong super effective attacks. Dragapult is also a good ally, as it can be used in either a supportive role defensively aiding Coalossal by using Light Screen, Will-O-Wisp, or Breaking Swipe to weaken opposing Pokemonâ€™s damage output, or as a secondary Dynamax candidate, helping Zacian-C or Urshifu-R deal out increased damage after Max Phantasm drops both opposing Pokemon's Defense. Incineroar and Rillaboom or Amoonguss are used as a defensive backbone. Incineroar provides Coalossal with Intimidate support, weakening threats such as Zacian-C, while Rillaboom offers a pivot into Water- and Ground-type attacks and useful priority with Grassy Glide, to chip opposing Pokemon into range of Coalossalâ€™s attacks, or faint after G-Max Volcalithâ€™s residual does its work. Amoonguss is used to further support Coalossal by redirecting attacks and applying pressure with Spore, as well as pivot into Water-type attacks like Rillaboom. There are two main restricted partners that Coalossal is run together with, Zacian-C and Yveltal. Zacian-C is used usually on faster-paced Coalossal teams with an offensive Dragapult set, so that it can provide strong, fast damage that is incredibly useful combined with G-Max Volcalithâ€™s passive chip damage. Yveltal is used usually on more defensive style teams with a defensive Dragapult set as well and helps Coalossal against Calyrex-S and Urshifu-R, both of which threaten it. Coalossal functionally cannot play without Dynamaxing, which is why many teams run a secondary Dynamax option, in case Coalossal has a hard time against opposing Pokemon and cannot reliably be used.</p>"

Magnet and Life Orb further increase Regieleki's incredible offense; Magnet lets a teammate such as Landorus-T, Dragapult, or Venusaur run Life Orb, but Life Orb is otherwise superior. Focus Sash is an especially useful item given Regieleki's frailty and makes it a great check to the combination of Tornadus and Kyogre.</p> <p>Regieleki's many positive qualities and strong synergy with other top-tier Pokemon allow it to fit on a wide variety of teams. Incineroar can threaten Grass-types such as Venusaur and Rillaboom, while Regieleki can thwart Water-types like Blastoise and Kyogre. Water-types are also strong teammates, able to check Ground-types like Landorus-T and Groudon for Regieleki. Zacian-C greatly benefits from Regieleki's Electroweb and ability to keep Water-types and Charizard in check. Landorus-T and Groudon appreciate Regieleki's speed control and Water-type checking, and Landorus-T can check Grass-types for Regieleki.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Dynamax and bulk investment, Regieleki has better survivability and cataclysmic power. Rising Voltage gives Regieleki the most powerful Max Lightning, and Rising Voltage becomes even stronger in the Electric Terrain set by Regieleki's Max Lightning. Electroweb supports Regieleki's team outside of Dynamax. Hyper Beam is most useful for Max Strike, which is Regieleki's best way to hit pertinent Ground-types like Landorus-T and Groudon, and it has utility in lowering Speed. Life Orb grants Regieleki immense power, allowing it to 2HKO even Amoonguss. The given EVs are optimal for Life Orb recoil and allow Dynamaxed Regieleki to always survive Adamant Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade after Life Orb recoil. Regieleki also outspeeds +1 Landorus-T with the given Speed. Regieleki's EV spread is fairly flexible, and it can very viably forgo bulk for more Speed.</p> <p>This Regieleki set fits well on Calyrex-S hyper offense teams and Calyrex-I Trick Room teams. Regieleki and Calyrex-S have a limited pool of mostly different answers and are immensely powerful, which makes them strong together. Calyrex-I is an excellent Regieleki partner, as it can destroy Ground- and Grass-types like Groudon, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom, while the slow Trick Room teams Calyrex-I fits on appreciate having a fast and powerful Pokemon for increased flexibility. Helping Hand makes Regieleki capable of incredible feats such as OHKOing Porygon2 and Dynamaxed Calyrex-S. Indeedee-F and Whimsicott are good options to provide Helping Hand on Calyrex-S teams, and Dusclops can provide it on Calyrex-I teams.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Incredible bulk, one of the highest Attack stats in the metagame, a highly diverse movepool, and success both under and outside of Dynamax make Calyrex-I one of the premier Restricted Pokemon and Trick Room sweepers in the Series 11 metagame. Glacial Lance is arguably the best spread move in the game, and its synergy with As One allows Calyrex-I to quickly snowball under Trick Room, with very few Pokemon able to withstand a boosted attack. High Horsepower hits Fire- and Steel-types, which resist Glacial Lance, for super effective damage. Calyrex-I's third and fourth moveslots are more flexible. Heavy Slam is mainly useful under Dynamax to hit opposing Calyrex-I, and it can pair with Max Quake to provide whichever defensive boosts are needed. Protect allows Calyrex-I to avoid damage, as opponents often focus on it to take it out quickly before it tears through teams, while Trick Room instead ensures that Calyrex-I isn't fully dependent on a partner to have a speed advantage. Many Calyrex-I opt for Weakness Policy as the item, which can work both with an activator partner or just taking foes' attacks, the latter being helped by Calyrex-I's immense bulk and several weaknesses. Other common options include Life Orb, which trades the massive damage potential of Weakness Policy for a more consistent offensive boost, and Lum Berry, which allows Calyrex-I to avoid burns and other statuses that are used to try and neutralize it. Other common set option include an Assault Vest set, which will typically run Close Combat alongside Heavy Slam in the final two moveslots, and faster sets on teams that use speed control methods other than Trick Room.</p> <p>Calyrex-I relies on several common partners to maximize its potential. It is most often run alongside a Trick Room setter: Dusclops and Mimikyu are common options that can support Calyrex-I with various moves, such as Haze on Dusclops to neutralize Intimidate drops and Safeguard on Mimikyu to deter status effects, as well as activating Weakness Policy with Shadow Sneak. Porygon2 has a less exhaustive support movepool but is much stronger against Calyrex-S teams due to not sharing a Ghost weakness with Calyrex-I like the Ghost-type setters do. Other common supportive partners for Calyrex-I include Tapu Fini, which protects Calyrex-I from status effects, redirectors such as Amoonguss, which can draw attention away from Calyrex-I while it sets up Trick Room or deals damage, and Fire-types like Incinceroar or Torkoal, which can pressure problematic Steel type Pokemon like Zacian-C, Solgaleo, and Necrozma-DM. Some teams will also opt for a secondary Dynamax or Gigantamax option that both covers some of Calyrex-I's weaknesses and gives the team an alternative \"fast mode\" that doesn't rely on Trick Room, like Venusaur (usually paired with Torkoal) or offensive Thundurus.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Boasting two of the highest Special Attack and Speed stats in the game and the ability to snowball via As One after every KO it gets, Calyrex-S is one of the strongest, most dangerous Pokemon in the VGC metagame. The combination of its Ghost- and Psychic-type STAB moves hits almost the entire metagame for at least neutral damage, barring Grimmsnarl, Urshifu-S, and staple Incineroar, which are its biggest nemeses. Astral Barrage hits both targets, 2HKOing almost the entire unboosted metagame. It allows Calyrex-S to hit the likes of Zacian-C, Dragapult, and Calyrex-I hard. It also turns into Max Phantasm when Dynamaxed, dropping the Defense of both opposing Pokemon for strong physical allies such as Urshifu-R. Expanding Force becomes a spread move under Psychic Terrain provided by an ally such as Indeedee-F and OHKOes Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Venusaur. Max Mindstorm also sets up Psychic Terrain, blocking Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Urshifu-S's Sucker Punch. Mud Shot allows Calyrex-S to hit Incineroar and becomes Max Quake when Dynamaxed, which consistently deals substantial damage to Incineroar while raising Calyrex-S's and its allies' Special Defense. Draining Kiss allows Calyrex-S to hit problematic Dark-types such as Urshifu-S, Grimmsnarl, and Yveltal. Hyper Beam is used mainly to turn into Max Strike when Dynamaxed, allowing Calyrex-S to lower the Speed of both opposing Pokemon. Trick Room is an alternative option, allowing Calyrex-S to support slower teammates such as Torkoal on specific team compositions. Life Orb boosts Calyrex-S's damage output to high levels, allowing it to 2HKO just about anything that doesn't resist its attacks. Alternatively, Focus Sash helps Calyrex-S in the mirror matchup while also giving it at least two opportunities to attack in every other matchup thanks to its naturally high Speed.</p> <p>Calyrex-S appreciates Tailwind support from Whimsicott, allowing it to wreak havoc with its powerful moves. Indeedee-F is helpful for its ability to set up Psychic Terrain so Calyrex-S can deal huge amounts of damage with Expanding Force and Max Mindstorm. Indeedee-F also provides Calyrex-S with redirection support in the form of Follow Me, as Calyrex-S is rather frail, and Helping Hand support to boost Calyrex-S's damage output to astronomical levels, especially under Dynamax. Calyrex-S is also accompanied by Pokemon such as Thundurus and Urshifu-R that can thwart its biggest check, Incineroar, by punishing its Intimidate with Defiant and Surging Strikes, respectively. Urshifu-S is also dealt with, as both of the aforementioned partners have super effective moves for it. Calyrex-S lowers the Defense of opposing Pokemon with Max Phantasm for them in return, allowing them to clean up late-game.</p>"
