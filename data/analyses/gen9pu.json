Brave Bird and Double-Edge are boosted by Reckless, letting Staraptor 2HKO Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Gligar. U-turn lets it pivot out of poor matchups like Houndstone and gives it more flexibility, while Close Combat is used for the Rock- and Steel-types that resist its STAB moves like Coalossal and Alolan Sandslash. Quick Attack is also useful for picking off faster foes like Inteleon and Choice Scarf Flamigo as well as slower priority users like Skuntank and Toxicroak. Tera Flying is recommended because even though both of Staraptor's STAB moves have the same base power, Tera Flying Brave Bird is more spammable than Tera Normal Double-Edge; however, Staraptor can be Tera Normal if the team it's on would prefer a stronger Normal-type STAB attack. A Jolly nature lets it outspeed targets like Galarian Articuno and non-Choice Scarf Meloetta as well as speed tie with most other Staraptor and Paldean Tauros-W in a pinch.</p> <p>Staraptor's weakness to Stealth Rock requires entry hazard removal for it to be at its max effectiveness, so Pokemon like Decidueye and Coalossal are recommended to support it. They also have the benefit of switching into common revenge killers like Virizion, Salazzle, and Ambipom, while Decidueye specifically can bring in Staraptor with a slow U-turn. Other pivots like Bellibolt and Inteleon can bring Staraptor in on their switch-ins like Wo-Chien and Gastrodon; in return, Staraptor can pivot on Pokemon like Regirock and Arcanine for them, making a strong VoltTurn core. Choice Specs Zoroark is also a notable partner, as many of Staraptor's switch-ins like Bronzong cannot take a Dark Pulse and many of Choice Specs Zoroark's switch-ins like Hariyama fall to a Brave Bird, so both can pivot to the other to create further mindgames. However, any form of entry hazards reveal the ruse quickly. Late-game cleaners like Arcanine and Paldean Tauros-W also appreciate Staraptor wearing down shared checks like Coalossal and Houndstone.</p>"

Ice Beam in tandem with Earth Power provodes near-unresisted coverage with only Rotom-H and Levitate Bronzong able to switch into this combination of moves, and it also hits common switch-ins to Earth Power like Rotom-C, Decidueye, and Staraptor super effectively. Clear Smog, however, works best on bulkier teams, as it both stops Gastrodon from being setup fodder and lets it check setup sweepers that these teams struggle with such as Bulk Up Scrafty, Calm Mind Florges, and Curse Arcanine. Surf targets Rotom-H, which Gastrodon walls but has issues with taking out, gives it a useful secondary STAB move and hits Flying-types neutrally. Gastrodon usually runs Stealth Rock is usually ran, but if a team already has a Stealth Rock user like Bronzong, Bombirdier, or Coalossal, Spikes could be used instead so it can help out its team entry hazard-wise no matter what. Leftovers prevents Gastrodon from having to heal as often, while Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates pressure from entry hazards during switches. Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to wall Water-type wallbreakers like Inteleon and also stop Qwilfish from pivoting with Flip Turn. Sticky Hold can be used on more defensive teams that require a Knock Off switch-in. Tera Poison helps Gastrodon check Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W, Hariyama, and Heracross while also turning its 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks into a resistance, letting it take hits from Rotom-C and Decidueye in a pinch. On top of this, it becomes immune to Toxic from Salazzle. Tera Fairy also helps Gastrodon versus the aforementioned Fighting-types, gifting it a more well-rounded defensive typing that allows it to check Scrafty, Zoroark, and Scyther better. Alternatively, a physically defensive EV spread can be used to better handle threats like Paldean Tauros-W, Skuntank, and Pawmot.</p> <p>While Gastrodon is a strong specially defensive wall, its Defense is lacking. In order to patch up this issue, Gastrodon pairs well with Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Altaria, as they can handle Staraptor, Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-W, and Hariyama more reliably. Gastrodon consistently checks Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-type Pokemon like Rotom-H, Skuntank, and Duraludon, so Pokemon that can benefit from this like Rotom-C, Flamigo, and Choice Specs Florges make for great teammates. Grass-types like Hisuian Electrode, Decidueye, and Rotom-C easily threaten Gastrodon; therefore, it should have partners like Arcanine, Paldean Tauros-F, and Rotom-H that can scare out these foes. In turn, Gastrodon handles threatening Water-types like Inteleon and Kingdra amazingly. With entry hazard support from Gastrodon, wallbreakers like Toxtricity, Zoroark, and Emboar break through their checks like Bronzong, Wo-Chien, and Milotic more effectively. Gastrodon also tends to drain momentum, so to circumvent this, partners like Rotom-H, Scyther, and Flamigo can check common switch-ins to Gastrodon like Rotom-C and Wo-Chien and also pivot to regain momentum.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Emboar makes use of Choice Scarf to counteract its middling Speed stat, becoming a terrifying revenge killer. Its main advantages over other revenge killers are its surprise factor and, more importantly, its incredible attacking power compounded by Reckless, with Reckless-boosted Flare Blitz making light work of threats like Scyther and Florges as well as breaking past common walls such as Wo-Chien and Bronzong. Knock Off complements Emboar's dual STAB moves well; it can slice through the likes of Delphox and Golurk with no drawbacks, as well as remove items from the likes of Gligar and Galarian Slowbro switching into it. Knock Off is usually the safest move to lock into due to its complete lack of drawbacks and its guarantee of progress with item removal. Earthquake is a useful mid-ground that can hit Fire-resistant Pokemon like Delphox and Arcanine and Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Toxtricity and Galarian Slowbro in the same slot while additionally avoiding negative contact effects like Bellibolt's Static, Skuntank's Aftermath, and chip damage from the various Rocky Helmet users in the tier. Head Smash is a risky coverage option that allows Emboar to hit Altaria super effectively while cleanly OHKOing Hisuian Braviary and making light work of Arcanine. Additionally, it retains some of the benefits of Earthquake by hitting Fire-types super effectively, and, as it's a Rock-type move, it has no immunities, unlike Earthquake. Head Smash is still a risky option because the recoil damage is a huge drawback, and its accuracy is poor. Wild Charge is another midground option that lets Emboar hit Water-types like Inteleon and Milotic and, like Head Smash, is boosted by Reckless. Tera Dark sharpens Knock Off into a strong STAB attack that can cleanly OHKO Delphox and 2HKO physically defensive Galarian Slowbro. Additionally, Tera Dark gives Emboar a relevant Psychic immunity in the face of Choice Scarf Meloetta and Galarian Articuno. Tera Fighting and Tera Fire can be used to bolster the already great power of Emboar's STAB attacks, letting it 2HKO Milotic and Arcanine with Tera Fighting Close Combat and 2HKO physically defensive Bellibolt and Gligar with Tera Fire Flare Blitz. Emboar's Choice Scarf-boosted Speed allows it to outrun even base 120 Speed Pokemon like Inteleon and Minior; however, Kilowattrel and various faster Choice Scarf users still outspeed and threaten Emboar.</p> <p>Emboar fits well on balance teams, where it can act as a physical attacker and revenge killer, taking the pressure off of potential defensive teammates like Florges and Duraludon in the face of threats like Delphox, Heracross, and Salazzle. In order to get the most out of Emboar, it should be paired with pivoting support, bringing it in without it taking unnecessary chip damage against offensive threats like Inteleon and Delphox. Good examples of partners that can provide this are Kilowattrel, Gligar, and Bellibolt. Florges appreciates Emboar's ability to threaten Steel-types like Bronzong and Alolan Sandslash. In return, it can either pass Wish, which is incredibly helpful due to Emboar's tendency to be worn down quickly, or clean up games with Calm Mind after Emboar has broken a hole in the opposing team. Healing Wish support from the likes of Mesprit is useful to not only give Emboar a second wind after it's chipped down by recoil and attacks but also clear potential status like paralysis to allow it to clean. Other physical attackers like Decidueye and Golurk can beat Milotic and Galarian Slowbro, respectively, additionally working with Emboar to take chunks out of Bellibolt. Entry hazard removal is important because Emboar already has enough issues being worn down by its own attacks; spinners like Alolan Sandslash and Hitmontop and Defoggers like Altaria and Scyther can fill this role. Kilowattrel is a good naturally fast speed control option to help round out Emboar's team and prevents over-reliance on Emboar to force out opposing threats. Choice Scarf Emboar should be used over its Heavy-Duty Boots and Choice Band variants on slower teams that rely on Emboar to outspeed and force out threats for them.</p>"

Dynamic Punch lets Golurk 2HKO Wo-Chien while also hitting other Dark- and Normal-types like Scrafty and Snorlax and threatening confusion against everything else. Close Combat can be used as an alternative due to its higher Base Power, which lets it guarantee a 2HKO on Wo-Chien after Leech Seed recovery; however, Golurk misses out on the confusion, and the Defense and Special Defense drops make it more susceptible to being revenge killed. Ice Punch lets Golurk OHKO Bombirdier and Staraptor while also serving as a good middle ground into Gligar. Stone Edge can be used as an alternative that's stronger versus neutral targets and has a higher chance to land a critical hit; although, Golurk loses out on the ability to deal with Gligar. Tera Dark flips Golurk's Ghost and Dark weaknesses while also removing its Water and Ice weaknesses, allowing it to avoid revenge kill attempts from Pokemon like Skuntank, Bombirdier, and opposing Golurk. Tera Ghost can be used instead to further boost Golurk's power, letting it 2HKO Pokemon like Gligar and guaranteeing OHKOs against Pokemon like Rotom-H with Poltergeist while still removing its susceptibility to Water- and Ice-type moves to avoid revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W.</p> <p>Golurk works best alongside Pokemon that benefit from its wallbreaking abilities such as Choice Scarf Staraptor and Curse Arcanine, which struggle with Bellibolt and Gastrodon, respectively. While Golurk has the coverage to hit the likes of Staraptor, Bombirdier, and Wo-Chien, their presence on the opposing team hurts its ability to freely use its STAB moves and forces it to make more predictions, so teammates that can handle these Pokemon like Bellibolt, which checks Staraptor and Bombirdier, and Paldean Tauros-F, which helps against Wo-Chien, make excellent partners. Furthermore, Paldean Tauros-F offensively and defensively checks the Dark-types that threaten Golurk, and other Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W and Flamigo are similarly good partners for this purpose. Golurk is also forced out by Water- and Grass-types, so teammates that can switch into these Pokemon, like Milotic and Gastrodon for Inteleon and Tatsugiri as well as Skuntank for Decidueye, are incredible partners for Golurk.</p>"

Shadow Sneak is useful priority to pick off faster weakened threats like Inteleon, Salazzle, and Delphox. Knock Off can be used to give Decidueye extra utility and punish common switch-ins like Staraptor and Wo-Chien, but it is very hard to justify using it over other moves, and it does not work well with Poltergeist. Spell Tag lets Decidueye OHKO Toxtricity with unboosted Poltergeist and Inteleon with +2 Shadow Sneak. Decidueye's choice of Tera type is flexible; Tera Ghost boosts the power of its Ghost-type STAB moves and gives Decidueye a better defensive typing, allowing it to spinblock Alolan Sandslash and set up on Pokemon like Delphox and Salazzle, while Tera Fairy allows Decidueye to take on Dark-type Pokemon like Zoroark and Scrafty.</p> <p>Decidueye excels on offensive or balance teams looking for a strong wallbreaker with sweeping and cleaning potential.

Tera Water is the most common Tera type for Inteleon, allowing it to further power up its STAB Hydro Pump and Scald.

For example, one layer of Spikes guarantees a 2HKO against Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro with Hydro Pump. Alolan Sandslash and Coalossal also have the added benefit of Rapid Spin support to remove entry hazards set by foes, enabling Inteleon to come in more frequently to wallbreak and to stay out of the range of priority moves like Skuntank and Zoroark's Sucker Punch or Arcanine's Extreme Speed. Additionally, physically defensive Pokemon to check these priority users such as Bellibolt and Mudsdale can be useful partners, as Inteleon is quite frail. In particular, Dark-resistant Pokemon like Florges can handle Sucker Punch users such as Zoroark and Bombirdier. Inteleon can form pivot cores with other offensive pivots such as Flamigo, Kilowattrel, and Rotom-C to maintain pressure on teams. Inteleon has a poor defensive profile, so it also appreciates slow pivots such as Bellibolt and Decidueye, as they are able to bring it onto the field safely. Salazzle can offensively pressure some of Inteleon's checks like Wo-Chien and can lure in and cripple others with Toxic, such as Gastrodon and Milotic. In return, Inteleon is able to handle the likes of Coalossal and Naclstack for Salazzle.</p>"

      "Shift Gear": {
        "description": "<p>Toxtricity offers the liberty to swap between the roles of a Shift Gear cleaner and Throat Spray + Boomburst wallbreaker with the same set. Very few walls can take its Punk Rock-boosted attacks after Throat Spray activates––Ghost / Ground-type Pokemon like Golurk and Palossand being the only exceptions––making the likes of Gastrodon, Coalossal, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro shoddy switch-ins at best. This threat creates setup opportunities for Toxtricity, which can then outspeed most of the metagame at +2 and clean late-game. Tera Blast Ghost is its best coverage move, nailing would-be checks like Decidueye, Golurk, Palossand, and Bronzong; importantly, the defensive benefits of Tera Ghost include more setup opportunities for Toxtricity and immunity to common priority attacks from Ambipom and Arcanine. Alternatively, Tera Normal offers a nuke of a Boomburst that outright OHKOes foes like Bellibolt and Mudsdale at +1. This comes at the cost of running the weaker Snarl to hit Ghost-types, and while Snarl offers good coverage without Terastallizing, it fails to reliably OHKO any of the metagame's Ghost-types and also makes Toxtricity completely walled by Soundproof Pokemon like Hisuian Electrode. A last alternative is Sludge Bomb, and in the same vein as Snarl, it can be a stronger option versus some walls like Wo-Chien without having to use Tera Normal Boomburst, but it fails to address some targets such as Golurk and Palossand.</p> <p>Sweepers such as Paldean Tauros-W and Decidueye alleviate some offensive tension that Toxtricity suffers from by targeting foes that could otherwise check it like Golurk, Goodra, and Gligar. Knock Off users like Skuntank and Scrafty help wear down walls like Mudsdale and Bellibolt so that they are KOed by a +1 Boomburst late-game. Specially offensive Knock Off users like Goodra and Salazzle also work for weakening special walls like Galarian Slowbro and Gastrodon; the former is in OHKO range from +1 Boomburst after Stealth Rock if it loses its Assault Vest. Toxtricity is often vulnerable to priority attackers after it takes damage when setting up, so teammates like Paldean Tauros-F and Staraptor are valid checks to the likes of Skuntank and Decidueye, respectively. This way, Toxtricity can be preserved and return the favor to these physically offensive teammates by putting pressure on physical walls like Mudsdale and Milotic.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>The raw power of Choice Specs, Punk Rock-boosted Boomburst, and strong STAB moves, with the option to be even stronger with Terastallization, is hard to stomach. That power, along with the opportunity to pivot with Volt Switch on the few checks Toxtricity has like Decidueye, makes Toxtricity an effective wallbreaker and pivot. Ghost-types like Golurk and Palossand are not safe switch-ins to Toxtricity given that Snarl 2HKOes them, albeit locking into Snarl can be prediction reliant. Sludge Bomb offers chances to OHKO walls like Wo-Chien and Florges, although its damage is equal to Tera Normal Boomburst and its coverage fails to nail anything notable bar Soundproof Hisuian Electrode. Due to relying heavily on prediction and Terastallization, this set sees less use and is harder to fit on teams in comparison to Toxtricity's Shift Gear set.</p> <p>One of Toxtricity's shortcomings is its frailty, so it relies on pivots such as Scyther, Staraptor, and Ambipom to get in safely. These teammates make an offensive VoltTurn core with Toxtricity, which returns the favor by positioning them through Volt Switch on some of its potential switch-ins like Decidueye and Galarian Slowbro. Dark-types like Bombirdier and Skuntank are necessary to punish opposing Ghost-types once Toxtricity is locked into Boomburst. Similarly, teammates such as Decidueye and Kilowattrel are important to defeat Ground-types like Gligar and Gastrodon. Toxtricity's wallbreaking can pave the way for specially offensive teammates like Calm Mind Scream Tail and Choice Scarf Florges to clean late-game. Spikes support from Alolan Sandslash and Qwilfish is noteworthy in supporting Toxtricity's wallbreaking, as a single layer of Spikes creates favorable chances to OHKO walls like Gastrodon and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro with +1 Tera Normal Boomburst.</p>"
