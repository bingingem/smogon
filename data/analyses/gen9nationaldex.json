        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard Y's immense power combined with Drought makes it an extremely dangerous wallbreaker that threatens common defensive staples like Alomomola, Melmetal, and Ferrothorn while also supporting its teammates via sun. Weather Ball is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, as it is perfectly accurate, quite powerful, and 2HKOs Pelipper in the rain after Stealth Rock. However, Fire Blast can be used to get better damage rolls onto Garchomp and defensive Landorus-T while also hitting Kommo-o through Bulletproof. Solar Beam provides crucial coverage for Water-types, such as Alomomola, Slowbro, and Rotom-W. Scorching Sands allows Mega Charizard Y to hit Heatran, Toxapex, and Mega Tyranitar super effectively; it also pressures them with burns, which is also useful against other switch-ins, such as Kommo-o and Garchomp. On the other hand, Focus Blast is far more threatening to Mega Tyranitar and still hits Heatran, but it leaves Mega Charizard Y struggling to pressure Toxapex. Roost allows Mega Charizard Y to stay healthy throughout a match; this is important given its extreme vulnerability to Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Entry hazard removal is absolutely imperative when using Mega Charizard Y due to its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Great Tusk is a standout partner that can clear hazards while also benefitting from Mega Charizard Y's sun due to Protosynthesis. It also offensively pressures common Mega Charizard Y switch-ins, like Mega Tyranitar and Toxapex. A secondary form of entry hazard removal, such as Terapagos or Defog Kartana, is required as well. Raging Bolt is another notable beneficiary of Mega Charizard Y, as it appreciates sun boosting its Special Attack and gaining access to a powerful Fire-type Weather Ball that lets it pressure Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Kingambit. Hisuian Samurott is also a good teammate due to it being able to set Spikes to wear down Mega Charizard Yâ€™s checks, such as Toxapex and Garchomp; in return, Mega Charizard Y threatens Clefable and Ferrothorn for Hisuian Samurott. Mega Charizard Y also appreciates Future Sight support from Slowbro and Galarian Slowking. This is especially potent with Focus Blast variants, as common Future Sight switch-in Mega Tyranitar does not want to take a Focus Blast, and it allows these variants to overcome their lack of coverage for Toxapex. They, along with Alomomola, can also function as slow pivots to get Mega Charizard Y in safely. Faster offensive threats such as Dragapult and Zamazenta appreciate Mega Charizard Y wallbreaking for them early so they can potentially clean up late-game; Dragapult notably does not mind Mega Latios and Mega Latias still being in play, as Mega Charizard Y can struggle to break through them, and it appreciates Mega Charizard Y overwhelming foes like Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu. Kingambit is another great partner that can Pursuit trap foes that are problematic for Mega Charizard Y, most notably Mega Latios, Mega Latias, and Dragapult, while also removing items from Moltres and Toxapex.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-W is an offensive pivot that threatens common defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Heatran. Courtesy of its ability, Ogerpon-W can answer a plethora of offensive Water-types, such as Mega Swampert and Urshifu-R, while ignoring Scald and Flip Turn from Slowbro, Toxapex, and Alomomola. Power Whip OKHOes Ursaluna and Great Tusk after minor chip damage, whereas Horn Leech provides it with longevity in exchange for power. U-turn allows Ogerpon-W to pivot out of checks such as Raging Bolt, Ferrothorn, and Dragonite. Knock Off is used to cripple switch-ins like Dragonite and Ferrothorn by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers, respectively, and also hits Dragapult super effectively. Alternatively, Encore can lock certain defensive pieces into recovery moves such as Toxapex and Mega Scizor. Encore also helps Ogerpon-W avoid mind games against priority moves from Raging Bolt and Kingambit and denies faster Pokemon like Zamazenta from setting up on it. Taunt is also an option to deny entry hazard-setting attempts from walls such as Ferrothorn and Clefable while ensuring Ogerpon-W walls Toxapex and Alomomola. Spikes can be used to wear down checks such as Ferrothorn and Raging Bolt lacking Heavy-Duty Boots, as it has the remarkable ability to force switches.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W commonly fits on bulky offense and balance teams. Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T appreciate its presence due to its ability to threaten foes such as Alomomola, Urshifu-R, and Moltres. In return, these teammates can provide entry hazard removal through Rapid Spin and Defog to prevent Ogerpon-W from being worn down quickly. Additionally, Landorus-T can bring it in with U-turn against Pokemon like Alomomola and Gliscor. Ogerpon-W is vulnerable to faster threats such as Iron Valiant and Dragapult, so it appreciates teammates like bulky Volcarona and Pursuit Kingambit to answer Iron Valiant and trap Dragapult, respectively. Ogerpon-W also loves Spikes support from Pokemon like Mega Diancie to wear down checks such as Ferrothorn and Raging Bolt and help rack up chip damage in combination with U-turn.</p>"
