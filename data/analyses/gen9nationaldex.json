        "description": "<p>Leveraging its high mixed natural bulk and resistances to many prominent offensive types, along with its natural ability to ignore Knock Off and status conditions, Mega Venusaur becomes a decent Mega Evolution for a myriad of team compositions. Sludge Bomb allows Mega Venusaur to threaten Fairy-types like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. Earth Power is required to hit Heatran and also to prevent the likes of Gholdengo, Sneasler, and Kartana from taking advantage of Mega Venusaur’s STAB options. Giga Drain hits most foes that resist its coverage moves like Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Great Tusk for neutral damage. It also gives more healing opportunities, since Synthesis has low PP. The given EVs allow Mega Venusaur to outspeed Landorus-T and Moltres, potentially KOing them with a crucial Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb, respectively. Mega Venusaur pairs well with teammates with a strong offensive presence, since they can fall back on its defensive capabilities to break throughout the course of a game. Specifically, since Mega Venusaur is unfazed by Knock Off and status conditions, it can reliably check Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Kartana can utilize its defensive capabilities and ability to switch into their checks to wallbreak more consistently. However, Mega Venusaur is very vulnerable to entry hazards, so allies that can remove them like Rotom-W and Great Tusk make great partners. Mega Venusaur is also easily checked by the likes of Zapdos and Tapu Lele, which can threaten it with powerful STAB moves, and Skarmory, which ignores damage from its moves. Some good teammates that can cover and check these include Gliscor, Heatran, and Gholdengo; in exchange, Mega Venusaur can check opponents like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Finally, since Synthesis heals less in rain, Mega Venusaur has reduced longevity against this archetype despite its resistance to Water, so it will need additional support from teammates like Gastrodon and Rotom-W to cover this.</p>"

Weather Ball is recommended for its high damage, perfect accuracy, and ability to pressure rain teams by doing magnificent damage to Pelipper in rain. Flamethrower is a great alternative, allowing Mega Charizard Y to maintain its STAB move outside of sun, but at the cost of being slightly weaker than Weather Ball. Fire Blast is less reliable due to its accuracy but serves as a powerful nuke, capable of OHKOing Gliscor after Stealth Rock and guaranteeing a 2HKO against Galarian Slowking and Garchomp. Roost lets Mega Charizard Y heal off potential Stealth Rock damage and act as a soft check to Mega Scizor and Rillaboom. Under sun, Solar Beam hits instantly and provides excellent coverage to obliterate bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Rotom-W, and Slowbro. Scorching Sands 2HKOes Heatran and pressures Toxapex, Gouging Fire, and Raging Bolt while also having the chance to burn threats that can switch into Mega Charizard Y's moves, like Garchomp and Mega Tyranitar. Focus Blast enables Mega Charizard Y to OHKO Mega Tyranitar while still allowing it to hit Heatran effectively, but its poor accuracy and ineffectiveness against Toxapex make it a less recommended choice. Entry hazard removers like Great Tusk, Kartana, and Landorus-T allow Mega Charizard Y to come in more often, as it is incredibly weak to Stealth Rock; Great Tusk in particular benefits from sun thanks to Protosynthesis boosting its Attack, letting it break past foes like Mega Latias and Dragonite for Mega Charizard Y more easily. Mega Charizard Y’s mediocre Speed and below-average bulk leave it vulnerable to revenge killers like Mega Diancie, Mega Lopunny, and Garchomp. Therefore, defensive switch-ins such as Great Tusk, Alomomola, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Galarian Slowking create great synergy with Mega Charizard Y. Weavile is a fantastic partner for its ability to beat Dragon-types such as Mega Latias, Garchomp, and Dragonite; it also appreciates Mega Charizard Y forcing foes like Alomomola to Tera Dragon. Raging Bolt also serves as an excellent partner, benefiting from Mega Charizard Y's Drought with Protosynthesis, which boosts its Special Attack, allowing it to break through Pokemon like Garganacl more easily.</p>"

It also has a niche as a physical attacker that’s immune to burn from Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp users such as Moltres and Rotom-W, allowing it to circumvent a good way to beat physical attackers. Earthquake allows it to hit Pokemon resistant to Flare Blitz like Heatran, Garganacl, and Toxapex. Dragon Claw is an option on teams that do not need Mega Charizard X’s defensive utility as much, as it allows Charizard to hit Dragonite, Rotom-W, and Alomomola. Roost is another option that can be used to provide Mega Charizard X with longevity throughout a battle, helping it heal from Flare Blitz recoil and entry hazard damage and allowing it to set up on Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Volcarona, and Clefable as well as threaten to wallbreak multiple times in a game. Ogerpon-W appreciates Mega Charizard X’s ability to pressure its checks like Ferrothorn and Dragonite and can wear down checks to Mega Charizard X like Alomomola and Toxapex. Pokemon like Hawlucha and Iron Boulder are good partners for Mega Charizard X, as they can chip down shared checks such as Landorus-T and Alomomola. Mega Charizard X hates taking damage from Stealth Rock, so Taunt leads like Grimmsnarl, Landorus-T, and Tapu Koko are appreciated. Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko also set up dual screens, allowing Mega Charizard X to offset its mediocre bulk and set up much easier.</p>"

Clefable is an effective Stealth Rock user due to its ability to threaten or cripple the majority of entry hazard removers, including Great Tusk, Kartana, and Tornadus-T, forcing out the former and paralyzing the latter two. Knock Off lets Clefable cripple switch-ins like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking, severely cutting into their longevity. Thunder Wave helps Clefable incapacitate offensive threats like Volcarona, Heatran, and Ogerpon-W. Trick alongside Sticky Barb gives Clefable a more efficient tool in wearing down its sturdier switch-ins like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Gliscor, and Toxapex, opening up avenues for its teammates to sweep more easily. Leftovers can be used instead of Rocky Helmet to provide some passive recovery, letting Clefable check Mega Medicham more easily. Tera Water lets Clefable take a Steel-type attack in a pinch and is a generally useful defensive type. Clefable works best on bulkier teams that can take advantage of its durability and role compression. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Gliscor are solid partners, as they can form a potent hazard-stacking core, which is especially solid alongside Clefable’s Knock Off. The latter especially works well with Clefable, as it can pivot in on Heatran and Galarian Slowking, which both force Clefable out. Offensive Pokemon such as Volcarona, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile are also good partners, as they appreciate Clefable crippling their checks like Heatran and Toxapex. While Clefable’s bulk is solid, it is often not enough to function as a sole check to the powerful offensive threats in the tier, so it is best to pair it with a sturdier teammate like Toxapex, Slowbro, or Galarian Slowking that can scout wallbreakers and spread out the defensive load.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots allows Slowbro to switch freely in spite of any entry hazards. Tera Steel can be used in a pinch to check foes like Mega Tyranitar and Tapu Lele, letting it either cripple them with a Scald burn or use Teleport into a revenge killer. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta appreciate Slowbro's FuturePort to bring them in safely on foes like Ferrothorn and Garganacl and subsequently pressure their switch-ins like Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Toxapex with the impending Future Sight. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Heatran help cover threats like Tapu Koko, Volcarona, and Gholdengo, respectively; in return, Slowbro deals with Ground- and Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Urshifu-R. Corviknight, Tornadus-T, and Buzzwole cover other physical attackers such as Kartana, Meowscarada, and Weavile that Slowbro struggles with; the former two remove entry hazards with Defog in case Slowbro is forced to take a Knock Off, while the latter can make use of Future Sight to wallbreak easier.</p>"

Mold Breaker allows Mega Gyarados to break past Pokemon it otherwise can't, such as Dragonite and Unaware users. Taunt allows it to block status moves like Toxic and Whirlwind from foes like Toxapex and Skarmory. Alternatively, Substitute allows Mega Gyarados to set up on foes like Alomomola, Garganacl, and Gliscor, though it becomes more susceptible to phazing and being forced out by defensive Terastallization usage from foes like Corviknight more easily, which can use Iron Defense to beat Substitute variants. Intimidate is the preferred ability on base Gyarados to get off an Attack drop before Mega Evolving to ease setup against mons such as defensive Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott. Jolly is preferred over Adamant, as Mega Gyarados appreciates being able to outspeed Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny at +1. Teammates such as Iron Boulder, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Great Tusk appreciate Mega Gyarados wearing down defensive walls such as Dondozo, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn while also being able to prevent their recovery with Taunt, allowing weaker physical attackers to clean up in the later stages of the game. Mega Gyarados is vulnerable to contact effects such as Static from defensive Zapdos and Rocky Helmet sets on Ferrothorn and Garchomp, as all its moves make contact, Rillaboom is also very threatening with its priority Grassy Glide being able to easily revenge Mega Gyarados, Zamazenta also poses a massive threat, being able to tank +1 boosted attacks and OHKO back with a Close Combat or Body Press. Some strong teammates to mitigate these are Tapu Koko which can provide screens support as well as set Electric Terrain, which prevents Dondozo from using Rest. Garchomp and Volcarona are also notable partners; the former switches into Zapdos, whereas the latter can set up on Ferrothorn, has a good defensive typing that allows it to switch into Fighting- and Fairy-type moves from the likes of Iron Valiant, and punishes Zamazenta and Rillaboom with Flame Body.</p>"

Volt Switch lets Zapdos pivot out on checks such as Heatran, Kyurem, and Mega Tyranitar, safely bringing in teammates like Great Tusk, Urshifu, and Ogerpon-W to take advantage of them, whereas Discharge lets it threaten to cripple the aforementioned threats with paralysis while also allowing it to consistently threaten Toxapex and Alomomola. Heat Wave nails Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, preventing the former from setting up entry hazards on Zapdos and the latter from using it as setup fodder. Hidden Power Ice allows Zapdos to break through Gliscor while also dealing consistent damage to Landorus-T and Garchomp. Defog is an option over either coverage option, but using it makes Zapdos substantially worse at checking certain Pokemon. Tera Steel lets Zapdos pivot into Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant in a pinch, while Tera Dragon lets it function as a strong check to Ogerpon-W and Barraskewda.

Zapdos works best with powerful wallbreakers like Ogerpon-W, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele that greatly appreciate it bringing them in safely with Volt Switch or spreading paralysis on their checks with Discharge, which slower wallbreakers like the latter two appreciate. Zapdos is easily forced out by strong special attackers like Tapu Lele and Heatran, making checks to them such as Mega Scizor, Galarian Slowking, and your own Heatran important in forming a sturdy defensive core. Lastly, due to the holes in Zapdos’s coverage if running Defog, teammates such as Toxapex and Gliscor that can cover Pokemon like Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn are imperative.

Volt Switch allows Zapdos to freely pivot while doing very good damage, especially due to common Ground-types like Landorus-T and Great Tusk being greatly threatened by Hurricane. Hidden Power Ice allows Zapdos to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor for massive damage. Heat Wave is used to surprise Ferrothorn trying to come in on a Thunderbolt or Hurricane as well as consistently threaten Mega Scizor. Flyinium Z allows Zapdos to KO chipped defensive Pokemon that would otherwise be out of range of a Hurricane. If Zapdos is not using Flyinium Z, then it can Tera Flying for stronger Hurricanes. Pokemon like Iron Boulder appreciate offensive Zapdos, as it can rack up chip damage on Pokemon that would otherwise annoy Iron Boulder, such as Garganacl, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn. For rain teams, Zapdos can do good chunks of damage to Pokemon rain teams would otherwise struggle to break, such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Galarian Slowking can comfortably take any of Zapdos's moves, and then set up a Future Sight, threaten to poison with Sludge Bomb, or pivot out into an offensive check with Chilly Reception. However, if Galarian Slowking is predicted to switch in, then Volt Switch can be used to gain momentum, allowing Zapdos to switch into something that can threatens Galarian Slowking like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, or Gliscor.

However, its main weakness lies in its overreliance on its Heavy-Duty Boots—although Tera could let it drop its weakness to Rock, Tera is usually better spent on other Pokemon, so Moltres still fears Knock Off from opponents it would otherwise check, like Iron Valiant, Landorus-T, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Tera Water is used to ease the matchup against rain, becoming a check to common rain abusers like Basculegion-M, Mega Swampert and Barraskewda and threatening to burn them with Flame Body. Tera Ground instead grants a resistance to Stealth Rock and Stone Edge from Choice Scarf Landorus-T and an immunity to Volt Switch from Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W and Thunderbolt from Iron Valiant. Mystical Fire is chosen over Flamethrower, as its Special Attack drop is useful to more easily check Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Mega Charizard Y, and Gholdengo. Scorching Sands is used to beat Heatran and also deter physical attackers looking to set up due to its high burn chance. Hurricane allows Moltres to OHKO Great Tusk and Mega Lopunny while heavily denting Volcarona and is useful in general as a powerful STAB option, U-turn allows Moltres to function as a pivot, pivoting out on foes like Heatran and Garganacl, and Toxic allows Moltres to punish Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Ting-Lu, and Garchomp looking to soak up its STAB options.

However, Taunt is also a valuable alternative to Agility in order to shut down defensive checks like Haze Toxapex and Unaware Clodsire while also preventing common status spreaders like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran from limiting its sweep. Heavy-Duty Boots negates chip damage from entry hazards and allows Galarian Moltres to set up more reliably. Flyinium Z is used in order to quickly eliminate bulkier threats such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn without risking a miss due to Hurricane's poor accuracy; however, this leaves Galarian Moltres unable to Terastallize against threats such as Tapu Lele. Sitrus Berry is another option that lets Galarian Moltres maintain its health and trigger Berserk twice. Galarian Moltres is a great user of Terastallization, using Tera Steel to set up on its standard checks in Tapu Lele, Toxapex, Tapu Koko, and Clefable. Tera Steel also lets it resist many forms of priority including, but not limited to, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Weavile's Ice Shard, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch. However, Galarian Moltres's new weaknesses mean that it has a harder time setting up on Mega Lopunny, Heatran, and Landorus-T while also being susceptible to other forms of priority like Kingambit's Sucker Punch.

Slack Off gives Galarian Slowking reliable recovery to handle the aforementioned threats long-term. Tera Steel lets Galarian Slowking handle Tapu Lele even better and let it pivot out into a teammate or damage them with either Flamethrower or Sludge Bomb, respectively. 0 Speed IVs let it pivot out last against slower Pokemon like Ferrothorn. More physically defensive sets can be used as well, but even with Galarian Slowking's great special bulk, it cannot sponge special attacks as well as specially defensive. Tera Water lets it take a Fire Blast from Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona and Thunder Wave in return, or pivot out on them as well. Galarian Slowking is very vulnerable to Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile, so teammates that can handle them such as Ting-Lu and Mega Scizor are well appreciated. Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny are notable abusers of Future Sight from Galarian Slowking, appreciating it pressuring and exploiting their checks like Toxapex, Moltres, and Zapdos.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>With an Assault Vest equipped, Galarian Slowking functions as an incredibly bulky pivot that easily checks Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, Mega Charizard Y, and Kyurem. Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, while Scald lets it punish foes with a potential burn, most notably Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Tyranitar. Ice Beam lets it immediately threaten switch-ins like Gliscor, but leaves it vulnerable to Heatran. Earthquake can be used to hit Heatran, but using it does come at the cost of not having the utility of a move like Scald. 248 HP EVs optimize Regenerator recovery, and in tandem with 224 Special Defense EVs, it lives 2 Fire Blasts from Mega Charizard Y after Stealth Rock. Tera Steel and Tera Water improve matchups against Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y, respectively. Both types also give it a Pursuit neutrality, leaving it less vulnerable against Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Galarian Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off to preserve its Assault Vest, so Pokemon like Mega Lopunny and Gliscor make for good teammates. The latter forms a good core with Galarian Slowking, punishing and gaining information on passive and offensive Pokemon throughout a game due to the duo's prolonged longevity. Entry hazard removal helps Galarian Slowking not be ruined by Spikes, so Defoggers like Moltres and Zapdos help it not be chipped as much.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With a great typing and good bulk, Mega Scizor can find opportunities to set up Swords Dance and potentially sweep against the likes of Galarian Slowking, Mega Tyranitar, and Landorus-T. Bullet Punch allows it to cleave through faster threats like Tornadus-T and Darkrai once boosted. Knock Off is an excellent move for punishing switch-ins such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Toxapex by removing crucial items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots. U-turn is another solid choice, as it keeps Mega Scizor's momentum against threats like Toxapex and Heatran while forming a VoltTurn core alongside teammates like Rotom-W and Zapdos. Close Combat is great for handling irritating Steel-types like Heatran, Archaludon, and Ferrothorn. Roost is needed in order for Mega Scizor to more consistently check Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Lopunny. The given defensive EVs allow Mega Scizor to always avoid a 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's Close Combat after Stealth Rock, while 20 Speed EVs let it outspeed uninvested Heatran. This set can be used on balanced and bulky offense teams alike. Due to its hard time with Fire-types like Heatran and Gouging Fire, Mega Scizor pairs well with Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Heatran. Pokemon like Great Tusk, Darkrai, and Ogerpon-W also appreciate Mega Scizor's ability to take hits from the likes of revenge killers like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny. More defensive teams value its ability to take on non-Swords Dance Gliscor, which is usually troublesome for those structures. In return, Pokemon like Toxapex, Alomomola, and Heatran resist incoming Fire-type moves. Entry hazard setters like Heatran, Garchomp, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl benefit greatly from Mega Scizor's Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Moltres and Zapdos. In return, their hazards damage those switch-ins, making it easier for Mega Scizor to break through over time. Mega Scizor can also struggle with Skarmory and Corviknight, so teammates such as Zapdos and Raging Bolt can take care of them.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Offensive Mega Scizor sacrifices a portion of its defensive prowess in exchange for enough power and Speed to be able to lure certain Pokemon while still being a powerful cleaner and revenge killer. Close Combat is useful on Mega Scizor, as it is able to OHKO Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Archaludon after a Swords Dance boost while additionally being Mega Scizor's most powerful option against Pokemon such as Raging Bolt, Alomomola, and opposing Mega Scizor. On the other hand, Knock Off sacrifices the immediate power of Close Combat in exchange for permamently weakening pokemon such as Zapdos, Volcarona, and Toxapex by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots, and is also Mega Scizor's strongest move against foes such as Volcarona, Galarian Slowking, Zapdos, and Tapu Lele. Sand Tomb is an alternative option, allowing Mega Scizor to trap and KO Toxapex to the benefit of teammates such as Urshifu-R and Volcarona while retaining Mega Scizor's ability to deal with Heatran. The given EV spread allows Mega Scizor to avoid being 2HKOed by an unboosted Tapu Lele's Focus Blast after Stealth Rock while also outspeeding defensive Landorus-T. The ability that Close Combat Mega Scizor has to lure Heatran is greatly appreciated by Pokemon such as Volcarona and Serperior, whereas Knock Off variants can permanently hinder Pokemon such as Volcarona and Zapdos to the benefit of teammates such as Iron Valiant and Kartana. Mega Scizor struggles to deal with Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Gouging Fire, and Zapdos, all of which can outspeed and threaten it with an OHKO or safely pivot around it, while Iron Defense Zamazenta is able to set up alongside Mega Scizor and beat it. Tapu Lele can also block Bullet Punch with its Psychic Terrain, negating a potential sweep. Teammates such as Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko are able to offensively check the Flying- and Water-type Pokemon that Mega Scizor struggles with, such as Zapdos and Toxapex. Raging Bolt able to check Mega Charizard Y and Ogerpon-W, whereas Tapu Koko overrides Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain with its own Electric Terrain. Rockium Z variants of Zamazenta can enable Mega Scizor to sweep by luring and removing Zapdos. Toxapex and Ferrothorn are able to defensively answer aformentioned Zamazenta, Volcarona, and Raging Bolt, which are able to set up in front of Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn specifically is able to set up entry hazards that heavily benefit Mega Scizor. Defog users such as Gliscor and Tornadus-T, are invaluable partners to Mega Scizor, due to its susceptibility to entry hazards and its inability to hold Heavy-Duty Boots to mitigate this issue.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Skarmory's excellent bulk giving it a favorable matchup against physical attackers and ability to wear down foes with Spikes grant it an important role on balance teams.  Iron Defense + Body Press allows Skarmory  to beat physical setup sweepers,  like Garchomp and Iron Boulder, and potentially clean late-game.  This is particularly potent due to the lack of Ghost-type Pokemon in the tier, which diminishes the common checks and counters. Furthermore, Tera Dragon allows Skarmory to win duels against Pokemon that it cannot usually handle, like Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R, while also mitigating its vulnerabilities to Fire-type and Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Gouging Fire without Dragon-type STAB moves,Fire Punch Ursaluna, and Iron Hands. Rocky Helmet punishes pivoting moves like U-turn from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Rillaboom, further weakening them over time and reinforcing Skarmory's role as a defensive stalwart and entry hazard setter. Moreover, thanks to the Rocky Helmet, Skarmory wins its duels against IronPress variants of Zamazenta. The 64 EVs in Speed allow Skarmory to outspeed threats such as Ursaluna and defensive Heatran. Skarmory emerges as an ideal choice for defensively oriented teams, capitalizing on its exceptional Defense to provide a reliable physical wall in defensive cores. Mega Tyranitar and Clefable can set up Stealth Rock and capitalize on its entry hazard support to apply pressure to opposing teams. They can remove Heavy-Duty Boots and other items with Knock Off from foes like Zamazenta and Ferrothorn. Additionally, to counterbalance Skarmory's vulnerability to special attackers such as Volcarona and Tapu Koko, pairing it with special walls like Galarian Slowking, Ting-Lu, and Heatran is essential. In return, Skarmory offers an invaluable check to Pokemon like Rillaboom and Landorus-T and applies pressure with its Spikes</p>"

        "description": "<p>Kingdra is a potentially deadly wallbreaker on rain teams thanks to its brutally strong STAB moves as well as its respectable natural power that, when combined with Swift Swim, lets it claim KOs left and right, especially against offensive teams. It, however, faces significant challenges in trying to accomplish this; namely, its poor bulk and mediocre typing mean it is revenge killed rather easily if it predicts an opponent incorrectly or misses an attack. It is also easy to scout because of Choice Specs locking it into a move. Hydro Pump, when boosted by Tera Water and in rain, becomes nigh-unwallable, heavily denting even stopgaps like Ferrothorn and rendering attempts to scout Kingdra using Alomomola or Toxapex highly dangerous. Draco Meteor is the other of Kingdra's incredibly powerful STAB moves, crushing common switch-ins like the aforementioned Alomomola, Ogerpon-W, Toxapex, and Raging Bolt. Flip Turn lets Kingdra keep momentum against the bulkiest of special walls like Chansey and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking that can take it on. Surf is a good mid-ground option that forgoes some immediate power for reliability, letting Kingdra revenge kill Pokemon like Iron Valiant in Rain while not having to worry about Hydro Pump's sometimes maddening accuracy. Pelipper is a must for Kingdra, as it is entirely unviable out of Rain. It also provides entry hazard control with Defog as well as a slow U-turn to give Kingdra the most chances at breaking through opposing teams with its breathtaking power. Nasty Plot Tornadus-T is a great partner for Kingdra, as it threatens the Grass-types that trouble it such as Ferrothorn and Rillaboom. In return, Kingdra helps to overload Steel-types like Heatran and Corviknight easily under rain, paving the way for other teammates. Zapdos is another option to take care of bulky Water-types more directly as well as check Rillaboom long-term. Mega Swampert is another great partner, as the two form a brilliant wallbreaking core that hit each other's checks: Draco Meteor crushes Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, while Mega Swampert beats special walls like Chansey thanks to its incredible physical power. Iron Treads is able to dictate the hazard game on rain teams by both setting Stealth Rock and by removing opposing hazards with Rapid Spin.</p>"

Knock Off allows Mega Tyranitar to remove items from switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk, greatly impeding their longevity. Pursuit lets Mega Tyranitar threaten to trap and remove foes such as Tapu Lele Choice locked into Psychic, Iron Moth, and Heatran. Additionally, the threat of Pursuit forces foes like the Tapu Lele to play quite predictably, easing the burden for teammates such as Galarian Slowking not having to fear Psychic-type attacks lest they be trapped by Mega Tyranitar. A solid matchup into common Defoggers like Zapdos and Moltres allows Mega Tyranitar to proficiently set up Stealth Rock, while Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots allows its own entry hazards to incur damage easier. The given Speed EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to outspeed Rotom-W. Iron Valiant is an incredible teammate for Mega Tyranitar, as Mega Tyranitar can trap and inflict heavy damage or outright remove Clodsire and Galarian Slowking, which are two of the biggest roadblocks for Iron Valiant. Defensively, Alomomola is very common teammate, as it can keep Mega Tyranitar healthy with Wish + Flip Turn and sponge attacks from Fighting-types it fears such as Mega Lopunny and Great Tusk. Gliscor can give Mega Tyranitar trouble, as once its Toxic Orb has been activated, it can switch in consistently without fearing the item loss of Knock Off while clearing Stealth Rock with Defog, so Ferrothorn, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon-W are good teammates to assist combatting it.</p>"

Its immunity to Electric-type moves is greatly appreciated for rain teams, which can struggle with common Electric-types in the tier such as Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko. Flip Turn allows it to maintain momentum against checks like Rotom-W and Alomomola while wearing them down. Ice Punch hits Pokemon such as Dragonite, Serperior, and Mega Latias that would check Mega Swampert otherwise. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used to take advantage of forced switches on Pokemon such as Garganacl and Galarian Slowking, as well as free up a slot for a teammate like Ferrothorn to run Spikes over Stealth Rock. Superpower is another option, which hits checks such as Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Ogerpon-W. As the premier rain setter in the tier, Pelipper is a mandatory teammate for Mega Swampert, being able to grant it free switches with its ability to act as a slow pivot with U-turn. Ferrothorn is another especially good teammate for Mega Swampert for its ability to switch into the defensive Water-types Mega Swampert has trouble dealing with such as Alomomola, Slowbro, and Rotom-W as well as Ogerpon-W lacking Superpower, and it can also make progress by setting hazards and forcing switches against these foes. Ferrothorn is also able to remove items like Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Skarmory, letting Mega Swampert attack more freely, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Alomomola, making them more easily worn down by hazards. Mega Swampert can also struggle against Grass-types such as Kartana and Rillaboom, which makes Pokemon like Zapdos and Tornadus-T great teammates for their ability to check the aforementioned Pokemon. Mega Swampert also appreciates other Swift Swim users such as Barraskewda as teammates, being able to wear down each others' shared checks such as Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Archaludon is a good partner, being able to check Grass- and Water-types Mega Swampert has trouble with such as Alomomola, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior.

Roost keeps Pelipper healthy throughout the course of the game, enabling consistent rain and better longevity against threats such as Urshifu-R. Hurricane can be used to hit foes such as Urshifu-R, Tera Grass Heatran, and most notably, Ogerpon-W, for super effective damage, while Defog is an alternative that removes entry hazards if common partners in Tornadus-T or Zapdos lack it. Tera Ground is used to change Pelipper's 4x weakness to Electric into an immunity to potentially absorb Volt Switch from Tapu Koko or Rotom-W and pivot out. Pokemon that need rain to boost their strength and Speed such as Mega Swampert, Barrsekwda, Battle Bond Greninja, and Urshifu-R are great partners for Pelipper. They particularly appreciate Pelipper being able to bring them onto the field safely and often into a winning position via a slow U-turn. Mega Swampert also serves as a bulky Electric-immune Pokemon that can check Tapu Koko for Pelipper. Other pokemons like Zapdos and Tornadus-T also benefit from the rain Pelipper sets up and can act both as excellent wallbreakers or entry hazard removers.

Knock Off provides coverage against Fairy-resistant foes such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn, annihilating them after a boost, and severely cripples Heatran. Sucker Punch makes up for Mega Mawile’s poor Speed tier, preventing it from being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Volcarona, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham. The given EV spread allows Mega Mawile to outspeed uninvested Corviknight. Intimidate is the chosen ability prior to Mega Evolving, letting Mega Mawile set up on physical attackers like Weavile and Rillaboom more easily. Mega Mawile appreciates being brought in safely via slow pivots such as Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Alomomola due to its mediocre bulk. Entry hazard support from Ferrothorn, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Landorus-T synergize well with Mega Mawile, as they wear down its checks like Heatran and Garchomp into range of a boosted Sucker Punch. Mega Mawile is prone to being revenge killed if its offensive checks aren't weakened, so it pairs well with a sturdy defensive core, such as Toxapex, Gliscor, and Rotom-W. These Pokemon also handle the Fire- and Ground-types that Mega Mawile is most susceptible to, such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Landorus-T.

It can also switch into status and Fighting-type moves and threaten an Encore or gain momentum against Pokemon such as Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Swords Dance Gliscor, as well as Zamazenta's Close Combat.

However, giving up Aura Sphere means Mega Latias has no way of threatening Ferrothorn, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar for consistent damage. Thunder Wave allows Mega Latias to severely cripple setup sweepers and offensive threats like Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Although Mega Latias has Thunder Wave to cripple most of its checks, it has issues with Dark- and Steel types that are able to take advantage of its relative passivity, such as Mega Tyranitar, Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Weavile, especially if not carrying Aura Sphere. Teammates that are able to help against these Pokemon include Toxapex, Zamazenta, and Gliscor, making them good partners. Mega Latias also struggles against Dragon- and Fairy-types that are either faster than it or immune to Thunder Wave, such as Raging Bolt, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele, so teammates that match up well against them like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, and Toxapex are good alongside it. In return, Mega Latias is able to ease the offensive pressure these Pokemon take, using Thunder Wave to cripple their checks like Heatran, Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom. Mega Latias enjoys entry hazards wearing down its checks such as Mega Scizor and Mega Tyranitar, so Pokemon that set them like Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Gliscor are good teammates.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With access to Calm Mind, Mega Latias is a threatening wincon, using its huge bulk, typing, and Spikes immunity to check and setup against Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Mega Medicham, and Zamazenta and potentially bowl over teams. Psyshock is used over other Psychic-type STAB moves due to its ability to hit Galarian Slowking harder as well as win against Pokemon that also boost their Special Defense such as Volcarona. Stored Power is another option that allows Mega Latias to boost past Unaware users such as Dondozo and Clefable while also becoming almost impossible to take on defensively after a few boosts. Aura Sphere hits Dark- and Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Ferrothorn, all of which would otherwise either completely wall it or remove it with Pursuit. Substitute is another option that allows Mega Latias to avoid status moves that would harm it greatly from the likes of Gliscor, Alomomola, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking while also taking advantage of Pokemon that are unable to touch it such as Garganacl and Rotom-W. It is recommended that Substitute is always paired with Stored Power and vice versa, as Substitute allows Mega Latias to stack more Calm Mind boosts and make Stored Power much more impending against bulkier teams. Due to Mega Latias needing multiple Calm Mind boosts to be threatening, it can be offensively exploited by Pokemon like Weavile, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant, which can prevent it from setting up by offensively pressuring it. As such, checks to them like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Zamazenta are good partners. Even with Aura Sphere, Mega Latias still struggles with Dark- and Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile. Mega Latias also has issues with prominent Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Teammates that can pressure these Pokemon like Zamazenta, bulky Volcarona, Heatran, and Zapdos are effective as such. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Gliscor and Ferrothorn also wears down these checks. In return, Mega Latias is able to take on Pokemon that are able to break through the balance teams that its teammates are found on, such as Ogerpon-W, Mega Medicham, and Zamazenta. Corviknight in particular is a very good partner for Mega Latias, as it checks Tapu Lele, Mega Scizor, and Weavile for it and removes hazards. In return, Mega Latias takes Electric- and Fire-types like Heatran, Rotom-W, and Mega Charizard Y.</p>"

Aura Sphere is important coverage to hit Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn as well as to KO chipped Mega Tyranitar. Mystical Fire hits the aforementioned Ferrothorn along with Mega Scizor and Iron Crown. Draco Meteor is a powerful nuke to threaten foes like Galarian Slowking after a Luster Purge drop while also immediately threatening other Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Mega Latias. Psychic Noise lets Mega Latios pressure checks that rely on recovery to deal with it, like Heatran and Mega Scizor, while also being a backup STAB attack with sufficient PP compared to Luster Purge. Mega Latios finds itself on many team archetypes including bulky offense and balance due to its versatility. However, it is outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Darkrai, and Weavile. Thus, teammates that can help with this like fast threats including your own Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant or defensive walls including Heatran and Clefable can help aid Mega Latios. In return, Mega Latios can pressure defensive checks like Heatran and Galarian Slowking for them. Good entry hazard control from allies like Great Tusk and Landorus-T helps, since Mega Latios is somewhat vulnerable to Stealth Rock due to its tendency to switch in and out very often.</p>"

Stored Power is Jirachi's main attacking move, nailing most foes that do not resist Psychic&amp;emdash;this also allows Jirachi to match up favorably against Toxapex and Clodsire, the two biggest setup stoppers in the tier. Aura Sphere allows Jirachi to deal with Dark- and Steel-types; these include Hisuian Samurott, Mega Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. Drain Punch is an alternative to 2HKO Blissey, which otherwise walls Jirachi, and keep itself healthy with recovery when fighting foes like Heatran. Iron Head serves as a secondary STAB move that can also flinch down foes like Galarian Slowking and Dragonite. A Naive nature should be run when using Drain Punch over Aura Sphere. Jirachi pairs well with allies that can take out its main checks, since it can only set up once and thus has to make it count. Magnezone and Heatran are stellar partners, trapping foes like Ferrothorn and Garganacl that may stand in the way of a Jirachi sweep. Offensive Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Garchomp that may struggle against Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant pair well with Jirachi, as it acts as a soft check to these foes and can use them as setup fodder. Tapu Lele is also notable for providing Psychic Terrain that blocks priority such as Sucker Punch from Hisuian Samurott and powers up Stored Power. Finally, dual screens support from Tapu Koko or Grimmsnarl is beneficial to ease Jirachi's setup, as the damage reduction affords Jirachi more opportunities to successfully use Z-Happy Hour.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Sporting its infamous Serene Grace-boosted Iron Head in conjunction with a good defensive profile, decent Speed, and a wide utility movepool, Jirachi carves itself a niche as a Choice Scarf user. Iron Head allows Jirachi to easily revenge kill Fairy- and Ice-types, such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Weavile, and has good odds to flinch down any foe that does not resist Steel, as long as they are sufficiently chipped. U-turn allows Jirachi to pivot out into teammates upon forcing out foes, allowing free points of entry for allies such as Ogerpon-W and Zapdos that capitalize on Jirachi's switch-ins in Heatran and Toxapex. Trick cripples most foes that try to switch into Iron Head; foes like Toxapex, Zapdos, Ferrothorn, and Alomomola dislike being locked into a move. Healing Wish gives weakened allies another chance to sweep, additionally curing status like burn and paralysis and offering a point of entry; it is best used on offensive Pokemon, such that they can be used more recklessly early-game and come back later to sweep. Ice Punch alternatively allows Jirachi to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Garchomp particularly hard. Jirachi is best used on offensive playstyles that appreciate its one-off heal and ability to cripple defensive switch-ins. Since Jirachi acts as a soft check to the tier's premier Fairy-types in Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele, allies like Zamazenta and Weavile that dislike them pair well with it, as they can threaten Jirachi's checks in Heatran, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Slowbro. Jirachi also struggles to revenge kill Mega Gyarados, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Scizor, especially once they set up, so allies like Ferrothorn and Corviknight are needed to act as sturdier checks. Finally, Jirachi is easily exploited by foes like Mega Charizard Y, Mega Scizor, and Garchomp, as all of them can switch into Iron Head and can ignore Trick provided the latter has a Z-Crystal. Allies that can take advantage of them such as Tapu Koko, Iron Moth, and Weavile make for good partners.</p>"

Aqua Jet gives Floatzel priority outside of rain against weakened targets such as Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny, and it bypasses Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tornadus-T and Zapdos all appreciate Floatzel's offensive capabilities, as it deals with wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Mega Diancie, Gholdengo, Zamazenta, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Valiant. Zapdos can reliably check Water-types that counter Floatzel like Slowbro and Dondozo. Tornadus-T can weaken and cripple Floatzel checks in Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Ferrothorn, as Knock Off removes Leftovers from them, making it easier for Floatzel to wallbreak. Offensive partners like Manaphy and Mega Swampert can overwhelm those same Water-resistant Pokemon as well as Dragonite.

It outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon except for Zamazenta, allowing it to pressure fast foes like Darkrai, Weavile, and Ogerpon-W. Fake Out puts many foes like Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Ogerpon-W into the range of an OHKO, and it can stop setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth after they're weakened or by sacrificing teammates to allow Mega Lopunny to use Fake Out multiple times. U-turn enables Mega Lopunny to pivot out on checks like Landorus-T, Alomomola, and Toxapex, while Quick Attack allows it to pick off weakened setup sweepers when paired with Fake Out; especially when they manage to reach a sweeping position. Teammates like Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Hisuian Samurott benefit from Mega Lopunny threatening Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Raging Bolt especially appreciates Mega Lopunny bringing it in against walls like Alomomola and Corviknight, while Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge to chip foes like Great Tusk for Mega Lopunny. Teammates with Future Sight support like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown also pair well with Mega Lopunny, making it easier to break through foes like Toxapex. Mega Lopunny can be annoyed by Rocky Helmet on Landorus-T, Static users like Zapdos, and Flame Body users like Volcarona, so Knock Off support from Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Landorus-T, as well as partners that can threaten them, like Ogerpon-W, are greatly appreciated. Mega Lopunny switches in frequently due to its role, which makes it naturally weak to entry hazards, meaning it benefits from teammates like Landorus-T and Rotom-W that can clear them. Mega Lopunny also appreciates entry hazards from its teammates like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Hisuian Samurott, since it forces many switches and can easily clean weakened foes.</p>"

Garchomp's positive matchup versus the latter three in turn allow it to set and maintain Stealth Rock very well. Additionally, Garchomp’s solid natural bulk and good typing lets it find opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, and Iron Moth. Outrage with Dragonium Z gives Garchomp a stronger option that can notably OHKO Landorus-T at +1 while also OHKOing Great Tusk and Zapdos at +2. However, the Z-Move can require prediction if the opponent has a Fairy-type lest Garchomp become trapped into Outrage and easily revenge killed by foes such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. In comparison, Stone Edge bolstered by Rockium Z provides a more consistent attack for Garchomp outside of its Z-Move while hitting foes such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight harder than its Dragon-type Z-Move counterpart. Offensive teammates who can exploit the wallbreaking capabilities of Garchomp such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Dragonite are appreciated, while teammates such as Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Ferrothorn give Garchomp a solid option to fall back on in the face of revenge killers such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p>"

Garchomp aims to punish physical attackers and force progression with entry hazards and Toxic. Dragon Tail lets Garchomp make the most of entry hazards laid by itself or teammates, being able to force foes to take damage at random if they lack Heavy-Duty Boots. Additionally, it can also be used to deny setup sweepers like Ogerpon-W, Iron Boulder, and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire lacking a Dragon-type STAB move. Garchomp can effectively lay both Stealth Rock and Spikes due to a positive matchup versus common hazard removal options such as Zapdos and Rotom-W while also dissuading Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin, as it will take serious chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Toxic is another way to avoid passivity; it can be used to wear down foes such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, Zapdos, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Tera Ghost is best used for deny Rapid Spin or to change its typing to survive other wise super effective hits such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Mega Medicham's Ice Punch. 56 Speed EVs are enough to outrun Modest Heatran. Mega Tyranitar is a solid partner, being able to remove Landorus-T and Great Tusk's Leftovers with Knock Off, which allows Garchomp to wear them down more easily with Toxic and Rough Skin in tandem with Rocky Helmet. Mega Tyranitar can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Alomomola and certain variants of Great Tusk, letting Garchomp's entry hazards rack up more damage. Garchomp really appreciates Alomomola’s Wish passing because it lacks a source of recovery. Garchomp's matchups against other Defoggers such as Corviknight, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T make it hard to keep hazards up at times, so teammates that can help with these Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos are appreciated alongside it. Galarian Slowking proves very useful to Garchomp because of its ability to check common Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, which usually force out Garchomp. Galarian Slowking also invites in many Pokémon that can give Garchomp an opportunity to get up Spikes such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Iron Boulder.</p>"

Tera Steel grants it the ability to ignore Toxic and set up on passive foes like Alomomola and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Fire gives Fire Fang a STAB boost and allows Garchomp to become immune to burn from foes like Rotom-W and Moltres. Both Tera types flip the match up against Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele, both of which can heavily threaten hyper offense teams which Loaded Dice Garchomp mostly finds itself on. Teammates like Volcarona, Raging Bolt, and Urshifu-R appreciate Garchomp threatening foes like Dragonite, Clodsire and Toxapex. Garchomp requires support to set up and sweep due to its typing and Defense drops from Scale Shot, so it is very helpful to have dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl. It also struggles against common threats like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Weavile, which makes Mega Scizor and Iron Valiant good partners with it. Landorus-T can pivot around Garchomp pretty easily, which makes Mega Scizor a good teammate since it can frequently force Landorus-T in and wear it down.

Fire Fang hits Skarmory and Corviknight and also OHKOes Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn at +2. Mega Garchomp appreciates teammates like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Landorus-T, since they can pivot and give it safe entry into foes like Toxapex and Heatran and let it take advantage of the switches it forces in order to set up Swords Dance. Dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl gives it opportunities to set up.

A Hasty nature helps Mega Garchomp take hits from Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, while Naive aids against Mega Tyranitar and Gouging Fire lacking a Dragon-type move. Mega Garchomp fits best on offensive teams that appreciate an early-game wallbreaker that can also set up hazards on switches it forces against Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking. Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Volcarona appreciate the hazards, chipping opponents into range of their attacks; they also appreciate its ability to take out specially bulky Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn.

Hippowdon can Terastallize into the Steel typing to avoid Toxic in addition to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks while maintaining its sand immunity and Stealth Rock resistance. Even beyond the simple type matchup chart changes, it allows Hippowdon to more easily check its targets such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Mega Diancie.

Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Raging Bolt love Weavile's ability to threaten Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu and force them to Terastallize so that the aforementioned Electric-types can revenge kill them. Weavile's inability to directly switch into attacks hinders it's ability to reliably break down teams, so teammates like Rotom-W and Tornadus-T that can pivot it in against the likes of Galarian Slowking, Mega Latios, and Zapdos are good partners. Weavile can't afford to lose its item because damage from entry hazards racks up quickly, so teammates such as Mega Lopunny and Mega Scizor that can absorb Knock Off are appreciated. Due to Weavile's vulnerability to fast revenge killers like Zamazenta and Tapu Koko, defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn make for good teammates. Weavile can be answered by defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, so pairing Weavile with answers to them, such as Garchomp and Volcarona, is beneficial.</p>"

Volt Switch lets Magnezone maintain momentum while eliminating foes such as Skarmory and chipping Heatran, which cannot be trapped and removed consistently. Alternatively, Tera Blast + Tera Fighting lets Magnezone remove Kingambit, potentially forcing it to Terastallize as well. Hidden Power Fire hits foes such as the aforementioned Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Ferrothorn. Toxic is another alternative that punishes switch-ins such as Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon, though it can be difficult to justify over other alternatives, as it hinders Magnezone's effectiveness as a trapper. Magnezone should only Terastallize when it can trap and eliminate Kingambit, since teammates such as Dragapult and Dragonite take advantage of Tera better. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to survive an unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana. Teammates such as Dragonite and Kartana appreciate Magnezone removing foes such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, allowing them to sweep easier. The former can also safely switch into Ground-type attacks for Magnezone, while the latter threatens troublesome Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon. Teammates such as Dragapult and Landorus-T provide pivoting support for Magnezone, granting it free entry against foes such as Skarmory and Kingambit to ease prediction. Dragapult in particular appreciates Magnezone trapping and removing Kingambit, allowing it to sweep without fear of being Pursuit trapped.</p>"

It can safely switch into and check physical threats like Mega Lopunny, Mega Swampert, Kartana, and Great Tusk as well as scout for Choice item users such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta. Knock Off provides further utility by crippling switch-ins like Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Heatran, and it hits Dragapult and Gholdengo super effectively. Hidden Power Fire pressures Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor—the former of which can use Tangrowth as setup fodder otherwise—while Hidden Power Ice dents Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Earthquake is an option to threaten Steel-types hard, including Heatran, as well as Tapu Koko and Clodsire. Stun Spore or Sleep Powder cripples foes like Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant, preventing Tangrowth from being taken advantage of by them, especially if not running the appropriate coverage move. Nature Power—if paired with Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain—immediately pressures Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Rocky Helmet chips down the physical attackers that Tangrowth checks, especially pivot attempts from the likes of Mega Swampert and Landorus-T, but Heavy-Duty Boots makes it a sturdier pivot in the face of entry hazards. Tera Steel improves Tangrowth's matchup against foes like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and non-Close Combat Mega Scizor, and it prevents it from being crippled by Toxapex, Clodsire, and Glimmora's poison. Teammates like Clodsire, Heatran, and Garganacl compensate for Tangrowth's exploitable special bulk by checking Pokemon such as Volcarona, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T, respectively; in return, Tangrowth handles the likes of Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Mega Swampert. Due to its reliance on Regenerator for longevity, non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants enjoy hazard removal support from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Great Tusk, with Tornadus-T in particular forming a sturdy Regenerator core with Tangrowth.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Tangrowth is a solid defensive pivot that checks threats such as Iron Valiant, Mega Diancie, and Kartana thanks to its typing, Regenerator, and well-rounded bulk. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona, both impairing their longevity and increasing their susceptibility to entry hazards. Earthquake hits the likes of Heatran, Iron Moth, Kingambit and Gholdengo. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used instead to hit Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele while threatening to cripple switch-ins like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Focus Blast can also be used to snipe  Kingambit, or even Rock Slide to remove unsuspecting Volcarona that try to set up on the switch—the effectiveness of both options are highly matchup dependent, however. Hidden Power Ice hits bulky Ground- and Dragon-types in Garchomp, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Gliscor, while Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. Tera Steel is preferred to turn Tangrowth's common weaknesses into resistances, helping it sponge Ice coverage from Weavile, Baxcalibur, and Mega Swampert and Hurricane from Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Moreover, it can be used in a pinch to resist Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Alternatively, Tera Water turns the tide against threats such as Weavile and Heatran while maintaining Tangrowth's ability to check rain wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert. Tangrowth fits best on bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to check Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Heatran receives strong support from Tangrowth, as Tangrowth checks threats such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp and pivots into foes with super effective coverage against Heatran, such as Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie. In return, Heatran checks Weavile, Volcarona, and Tornadus-T. Toxapex and Tornadus-T both benefit from Tangrowth's ability to pivot into threats such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W, with the former receiving the same level of support from Tangrowth as does Heatran. This trio comprises a formidable Regenerator core, with Toxapex removing Toxic Spikes and checking Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Weavile, and Tornadus-T providing valuable entry hazard removal to reinforce the longevity of the core. Tangrowth is susceptible to entry hazards, which can often put it into 2HKO range of certain attacks; therefore, it appreciates entry hazard removers like the aforementioned Tornadus-T, as well as Rotom-W. Defensive cores supported by Tangrowth can fall victim to Kyurem as a result of its lethal coverage. Volcarona and Mega Scizor are teammates that can take advantage of Kyurem with their ability to set up and reliable recovery. With Tornadus-T forcing Tangrowth out, Rotom-W and Tapu Koko make for stellar teammates with their resistance to Hurricane and ability to pivot. In return, Tangrowth forces out Gastrodon, which otherwise checks the aforementioned teammates.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Gliscor is the most potent and efficient wincon in the tier, able to outlast almost all of its checks, courtesy of its its immense bulk and its ability Poison Heal, which grants it status immunity, passive recovery, and the ability to not worry about Knock Off crippling it. These traits also allow it to check and freely set up on a myriad of Pokemon such as Toxapex, Heatran, and Mega Diancie. Facade complements Earthquake, giving Gliscor near perfect coverage, and its high PP also lets Gliscor outlast checks like Skarmory. Roost is important, as it lets Gliscor stave off stronger attacks like Tapu Koko’s Hidden Power Ice and lets Gliscor scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Kartana. Taunt can also be used over Earthquake to deny more passive checks such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn from boosting up with Iron Defense or Leech Seeding it, as well as beat opposing Swords Dance Gliscor and Taunt Heatran if it Terastallizes. However, this comes at the cost of significant special bulk due to the need to run more Speed investment, as well as the ability to instantly threaten Heatran. Swords Dance Gliscor is a frequent Tera user, as it can often be extremely difficult to revenge kill once it has Terastallized to beat any offensive check it has. Tera Fairy gives Gliscor an all-around great defensive type, letting it take neutral or resisted damage from attacks like Kyurem’s Freeze Dry and Darkrai’s Dark Pulse while still being neutral to Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type attacks. Tera Water, on the other hand, lets Gliscor resist these Water- and Ice-type attacks, completely flipping the matchup on Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Weavile. The given EVs maximise Gliscor’s Poison Heal recovery and special bulk, with the remaining EVs in Speed, but a Jolly nature with 20 Speed EVs can be used with Taunt to outspeed max Speed Modest Heatran. Swords Dance Gliscor works best on bulkier teams with solid entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Clefable to help pressure the switches it forces. Pokemon like Kartana, Iron Valiant, and Mega Tyranitar that can cripple or pressure its checks, such as Skarmory, Mega Latias, and Ferrothorn, are amazing partners as well. Other setup sweepers such as Iron Defense Zamazenta and Calm Mind Mega Latias also appreciate Gliscor’s ability to take advantage of Galarian Slowking and Toxapex. If Gliscor has not yet Terastallized, it can easily be forced out by Water- and Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Kyurem; this makes partners like Mega Scizor, Toxapex, and Corviknight that can stave off these attacks important.</p>"

These attributes also provide Gliscor with numerous opportunities to switch in and either set or remove entry hazards against passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Clefable, and Landorus-T. Toxic helps with Gliscor's passiveness and puts its offensive checks like Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Urshifu-R on a timer, letting it outlast the former two, which seek to remove its Spikes. Roost is important for Gliscor’s durability, letting it constantly stave off attacks from Pokemon like Heatran and Mega Diancie throughout the match. Knock Off is an option over Toxic to cripple Gliscor’s switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W, allowing it to further pressure them with Spikes. However, this does make Gliscor significantly more passive, making it generally inferior to Toxic unless desperately needed. Tera Fairy lets Gliscor pivot into Choice Specs Darkrai’s Dark Pulse in a pinch and check Raging Bolt consistently, while Tera Water lets Gliscor get off a Toxic or Earthquake on threats like Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R to prevent them from spiraling out of control. Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant appreciate Spikes chip damage helping to wear down their checks. Due to its susceptibility to strong Water- and Ice-type attacks, Toxapex, Kartana, and Mega Scizor are premier partners, which also also appreciate Gliscor checking Heatran, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko.</p>"

It has a good defensive typing and ability, allowing it opportunities to switch in and gain momentum against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran. Volt Switch lets Rotom-W safely pivot into the aforementioned wallbreakers despite their frailty. This pairs well with Hydro Pump, threatening Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Gliscor. Trick allows Rotom-W to cripple Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex as well as Pokemon used on stall teams like Blissey and Clodsire while also freeing up the move lock on Choice Scarf, allowing for it to ease prediction against Electric-type immune Pokemon. Thunder Wave pairs well with Choice Scarf, as it allows Rotom-W to slow down imposing wallbreakers and setup sweepers that are otherwise faster than it such as Tapu Lele, Gouging Fire, and Zamazenta. Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-W immediately threaten physical attackers such as Dragonite and Mega Scizor, making them unable to snowball out of control. However, this does come at the cost of not being able to cripple Gouging Fire and Volcarona. Pain Split gives Rotom-W a limited form of recovery after using Trick, allowing it to stay in a game much longer and check Gliscor and Heatran more consistently. The EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed Adamant Gouging Fire at +1. Tera Ghost allows it to check dangerous wincons like Ursaluna and Swords Dance Gliscor much better while also granting it a Fighting immunity against the likes of Zamazenta. However, Tera Steel can give Rotom-W a better matchup against Tapu Lele and Rillaboom so it can cripple them with status aliments. Rotom-W mainly fits on offense and bulky offense teams that lack speed control and want a fast pivot that can give opportunities for frail wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Weavile, and Tapu Lele, bringing them in on Ferrothorn, Raging Bolt, and Galarian Slowking. Weavile is an especially good teammate due to it removing Galarian Slowking and Mega Latias with Pursuit. Pokemon like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn are good stopgaps into Rotom-W’s checks like Raging Bolt and Mega Latios. Pivots like Mega Scizor and Landorus-T form VoltTurn cores with Rotom-W, racking up high amounts of chip damage and paving the way for the aforementioned wallbreakers to break through teams more easily. In return, Rotom-W provides a check to and can potentially cripple Pokemon problematic to these teammates like Gliscor, Heatran, and Zamazenta.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Rotom-W provides a unique blend of defensive utility and wallbreaking potential thanks to its great combination of typing and ability in addition to its versatile movepool. Discharge has a chance to paralyze and cripple bulky switch-ins like Serperior, Tapu Lele, and Dragonite. Substitute keeps Rotom-W safe from status moves like Toxic and generates free turns for it to set up, turning many common utility Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, and Heatran into Rotom-W's setup fodder. Volt Switch and Will-O-Wisp can be used as an alternative combination, the former helping Rotom-W keep up the momentum and the latter helping to cripple threats such as Dragonite and Garchomp. However, this combination is less effective for wallbreaking because it makes Rotom-W vulnerable to status moves and forces it to switch out if it needs to use its Electric-type STAB move, losing the boost from Nasty Plot. Tera Ghost combined with Levitate counters several popular Ground-type threats like Ursaluna, Sword Dance Gliscor, and Great Tusk, while Tera Steel and Tera Poison complement Levitate well and let Rotom-W effectively wall utility variants of Gliscor, the former improving its matchup into Tapu Lele and the latter granting it a resistance to common Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Urshifu-R. 44 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T so it can set up Substitute first and dodge Toxic, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into bulk so it can check the aforementioned physical threats better. With most Rotom-W sets being pure utility, this set can often come across as a surprise to the would-be bulky checks to it such as Clefable, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking, and it can also disrupt the opponent's pace by setting up Substitute and boost with Nasty Plot. However, both of its STAB moves are resisted by Grass-types and Dragon-types, which means it loses to the likes of Ferrothorn and Raging Bolt even after boosting. Serperior and Kyurem especially prey on this set because they both can use it as setup fodder.</p>"

Toxic is valuable on Heatran to wear down Pokemon that can either check it or set up in front of it, such as Alomomola, Rotom-W, Mega Latias, Raging Bolt and Volcarona, whereas Stealth Rock takes advantage of Heatran's ability to act as a blanket check to most special attackers in the tier. In addition, many defensive staples such as Galarian Slowking, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Tornadus-T are forced to switch out of Heatran in fear of Toxic or Magma Storm, and it can also threaten many common Defoggers such as Zapdos and Corviknight, affording it many opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Taunt is a powerful option to deny setup from the likes of Mega Latias, which could otherwise set up and eventually muscle past Heatran, while also being extremely synergistic with Heatran's other moves; in combination with Magma Storm, Heatran is able to trap pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Toxapex, and Zapdos lacking Volt Switch, denying their recovery and Galarian Slowking's Chilly Reception. Additionaly, when paired with Toxic it is able to wear down Alomomola, which is otherwise a major roadblock for Heatran, and allows Heatran to beat it in the long run. Tera Grass provides Heatran with a resistance to Water- and Ground-Type attacks, allowing Heatran to wall Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona variants lacking Bug Buzz while also checking Ogerpon-W, additionally allowing Heatran to trap Gliscor if using Taunt and an alternative spread of 252 HP / 108 SpD / 148 Spe, which allows Heatran to outspeed Gliscor. Heatran is a powerful addition to most defensive structures thanks to its ability to check many special attackers such as Volcarona, Serperior, Mega Latios, and Tapu Lele, whereas its ability to trap Galarian Slowking and Toxapex is greatly appreciated by teammates such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona. Due to lacking both reliable recovery and an immunity to Spikes, Heatran is extremely vulnerable to hazards, and is prone to being worn down during longer battles, thus Alomomola is a powerful boon to Heatran's longevity, allowing it to remain healthy throughout a prolonged match, and is also an exceptional pivot, allowing Heatran to switch in on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex that commonly switch into Alomomola, providing Heatran with more opportunities to set up Stealth Rock or wear down the opposing team with Magma Storm and Toxic. Pokemon such as Zapdos, Gliscor, and Ferrothorn are able to check Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, opposing Gliscor, and Ogerpon-W that Heatran struggles to deal with; the former two also utilize Defog to aid in Heatran's longevity, while the latter is able to set up Spikes to further capitalize on the many switches that Heatran forces.</p>"

Magma Storm is a powerful Fire-type STAB move that can wear down switch-ins, like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Alomomola, and trap and eliminate Toxapex. Earth Power gives Heatran crucial coverage to hit Pokemon resistant to Fire such as Toxapex, Gouging Fire, Garganacl, and most importantly, opposing Heatran. Taunt allows Heatran to shut down recovery from defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex and Garganacl, as well as deny setup attempts from Pokemon like Mega Latias and Gouging Fire. Hidden Power Ice allows Heatran to lure Pokemon such as Gliscor, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Dragonite to the benefit of teammates such as Volcarona, Zamazenta, and Raging Bolt. Toxic can be used to hinder common switch-ins, such as Garchomp and Rotom-W, as well as punish setup sweepers such as Volcarona, Mega Latias, and Gouging Fire. Tera Blast in conjunction with Tera Grass effectively gives Heatran a Grass-type STAB option that lets it lure in and remove Water-types, such as Alomomola and Rotom-W, for teammates such as Gouging Fire and Landorus-T. Tera Grass also turns Heatran's weaknesses to Ground and Water into resistances while retaining its immunity to Fire thanks to Flash Fire, helping it beat Pokemon like Gliscor, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona lacking Bug Buzz. Should your team's Z-Crystal slot be available, Heatran can utilize Solar Beam in the last slot with Grassium Z to weaken checks such as Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar for teammates like Darkrai, Mega Charizard Y, and Gouging Fire. Leftovers gives Heatran a source of recovery that gives it more longevity throughout a game, while Air Balloon can turn the tables on Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, as well as Pokemon that carry Ground-type coverage, such as Gouging Fire and Dragonite, while also giving it a temporary immunity to Spikes. A Modest nature is preferred to maximize Heatran's power, but a Timid nature can be used instead to outspeed tank Garchomp. Special wallbreakers like Mega Charizard Y and Darkrai appreciate Heatran's ability to remove special walls such as Toxapex and Chansey. Mega Charizard Y in particular is a great teammate for Heatran, as it can pivot into Ground- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at it while also boosting Heatran's Fire-type attacks with Drought. Other wallbreakers such as Dragonite and Rillaboom appreciate Heatran's ability to wear down Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Toxapex. Rillaboom can also get up Grassy Terrain, which gives Heatran passive recovery, weakens opposing Earthquake users, and boosts the power of Tera Blast Grass and Solar Beam, making it easier for Heatran to blow through Pokemon such as Dondozo, Garchomp, and Mega Tyranitar. On the other hand, Dragonite can check Ogerpon-W and pivot into Ground-type attacks aimed at Heatran from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gliscor. Due to Heatran's vulnerability to Ground, pivots such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W make great partners, especially since they can pivot into Heatran against their checks such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn.</p>"

With these traits, Manaphy can virtually take out any wall, breaking through even specially defensive Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Mega Latias with its very powerful Hydro Vortex while also healing off any chip damage from foes like Blissey thanks to Hydration + Rest. Hydration additionally lets Manaphy deny status from the likes of Gliscor, Toxapex, and Tera Grass Heatran. This gives rain teams a much better fat balance and stall matchups, since the only way to take it out is with offensive pressure. Psychic is used as coverage for a would-be check in Toxapex, but Energy Ball is a good alternative for hitting Dondozo and Tera Water Garganacl for super effective damage. Pelipper is a required partner for setting up rain and pivoting Manaphy in. Other partners like Ferrothorn and Archaludon are appreciated due to their ability to take on Pokemon like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt that force out Manaphy, and, in Ferrothorn's case, it can also chip said Pokemon with entry hazards while taking them on. In return, Manaphy can take out troublesome foes like Ting-Lu and Heatran for said partners. Swift Swim Pokemon like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda are appreciated for their ability to pressure more offensive teams that can deny Manaphy setup opportunities, and in return, Manaphy can break through Pokemon like Alomomola and Rotom-W. Zapdos and Raging Bolt are also great partners because they can take Grass-type attacks from Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W and hit Toxapex and Dondozo; meanwhile, Manaphy can do devastating damage to its partners' checks in Galarian Slowking and Mega Tyranitar.</p>"

Other special wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Raging Bolt, and Iron Valiant appreciate Darkrai's ability to weaken or KO special walls such as Heatran or Gliscor. Darkrai is liable to being outsped and revenge killed by Pokemon like Booster Energy Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Booster Energy Iron Boulder, Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, so a strong defensive backbone with Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Heatran is heavily recommended.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Victini is a potent revenge killer, capable of picking almost any foe to trade with using Final Gambit including Zamazenta and Landorus-T while also having the option to cripple other switch-ins with its remaining movepool. U-turn is useful to pivot out of checks that shrug off V-create like Toxapex and defensive Landorus-T, although Victini should be wary of Rocky Helmet on the latter. Trick is used to cripple tanks like Garganacl and Slowbro, reducing their longevity while receiving Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers in return. V-create's explosive power needs little Attack investment to perform effectively, still easily 2HKOing most neutral targets including defensive Volcarona and Tornadus-T. Thus, 248 HP EVs are instead used to maximize the potential of Final Gambit while minimizing damage from Stealth Rock. Tera Fire is used to fuel V-create, notably OHKOing Tornadus-T, and remove Victini’s weakness to Pursuit, but this comes at the cost of a comparably worse defensive typing against foes like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta. Victini's ability to threaten any foe allows it to very easily pivot into wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R, which appreciate having annoying defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Toxapex crippled or removed with Trick or Final Gambit. Setup sweepers also benefit greatly from Victini's presence, as it can surprise and KO defensive threats that would otherwise impede their progress; allies like Mega Medicham and Garchomp enjoy having threats like Gliscor and Landorus-T removed, and the clean field left after Victini KOes itself also affords them a free point of entry. However, Victini must be kept as healthy as possible to ensure that Final Gambit can OHKO what it needs to. Thus, allies that can soak up Water- and Ground-type moves like Gastrodon and Rotom-W make for valuable partners. Entry hazard removal from allies like Zapdos is also useful to ensure hazards do not hamper Victini’s effectiveness.</p>"
      },
      "Z-Celebrate": {
        "description": "<p>Victini is a potent user of Z-Celebrate, as its already decent natural bulk and typing greatly appreciate the defensive boosts, not to mention the offensive power gained. STAB-boosted Stored Power easily 2HKOes many defensive foes like Gliscor and even Unaware users including Clodsire and Skeledirge. Searing Shot is another STAB option to target Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast allows Victini to target pesky Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Ting-Lu along with Heatran, with its low accuracy somewhat offset by Victory Star. Victini can leverage its bulk to set up on many fast threats such as Mega Lopunny, and its buff after omniboosting lets it survive super effective moves from more passive enemies like Gliscor, making it a perfect fit on hyper offense. It is also naturally resistant to priority moves like Bullet Punch from Scizor, Vacuum Wave from Iron Valiant, and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom. Z-Celebrate Victini pairs well with entry hazard suicide leads like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as their Stealth Rock and potentially Spikes support is invaluable; with Stealth Rock, an OHKO on Tera Water Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W are near guaranteed; Stealth Rock also notably breaks Ogerpon-C’s Sturdy along with stray Focus Sashes. Victini also appreciates teammates like Close Combat Iron Valiant luring Blissey and Tera Dark Clodsire, and they also help soften up Ting-Lu for Victini. Tapu Lele is another useful ally that can boost Stored Power with its summoned Psychic Terrain, which also prevents priority including Mega Lopunny’s Fake Out and Hisuian Samurott’s Sucker Punch for a limited time. After Victini heavily weakens foes and potentially forces them to Terastallize, Tapu Lele can also clean up, since any remaining Psychic-resistant foes would be heavily chipped.</p>"

      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Victini is a pivot with a unique defensive typing, allowing it to soft check threats such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Mega Charizard Y, although its lack of recovery leaves it vulnerable over the course of a long game, even equipped with Heavy-Duty Boots. Instead, Victini makes explosive use of each opportunity it gets to blast through foes with V-create, leaving a massive dent in many defensive cores once it manages to pivot in. Bolt Strike is used for coverage, targeting Water-types like Pelipper, Alomomola, and Toxapex. U-turn allows Victini to pivot out of bad matchups like Great Tusk and Rotom-W or after using V-create, pivoting in teammates to help it wallbreak. Encore can lock greedy setup sweepers like Gliscor and Garganacl into moves like Swords Dance or Iron Defense, allowing Victini to give its ally a free switch in or simply hit something hard with V-create. Toxic is an alternative to wear down defensive threats like Ting-Lu and Landorus-T into range of Victini or an ally and also cripple other switch-ins like Garchomp and Dragonite. Tera Fire cranks up the power of V-create, turning Victini into a wallbreaker capable of scorching most neutral targets for a 2HKO, like Tera Fairy Garganacl and Ting-Lu, and also notably OHKOing Tornadus-T. However, it then loses valuable resistances to Fighting- and Psychic-type moves, leaving it unable to check Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham after Tera. Victini suits bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression both offensively and defensively. Wallbreakers like Weavile, Urshifu-R, and Mega Charizard Y all appreciate Victini's ability to give them free points of entry with U-turn, and the latter also boosts V-create with sun. However, due to its weakness to Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots have been removed, as well as its weakness to Knock Off and Pursuit in general, Victini appreciates having teammates that can beat Dark-types like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile; Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny are good partners to check them and in the latter's case also absorb Knock Off. Victini is also vulnerable to Water-type moves from the likes of Mega Swampert and Basculegion especially when they are in rain, so allies that can soak up these moves like Gastrodon and Ferrothorn are good partners. In return, Victini takes Grass- and Fire-type moves for them, respectively. Finally, Tornadus-T, Landorus-T and Gliscor can help switch into Ground-type moves from the likes of Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Garchomp, and in return Victini tanks Ice-type moves from Alolan Ninetales and Kyurem for them.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Serperior is a good cleaner due to its excellent Speed tier and the combination of Contrary and Leaf Storm. It has decent natural bulk and a useful defensive typing that helps it find opportunities to switch in and set up against foes like Gliscor and Ogerpon-W. Hidden Power Fire is its most important coverage move for foes like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Iron Crown, all of which could stop Serperior otherwise even after several boosts. Glare provides excellent utility by crippling would-be checks such as Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Volcarona with paralysis. Substitute, when paired with Glare and passive recovery from Leftovers, enables Serperior to fish for full paralysis and set up against more passive foes like Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking, and it can even stall out Heatran's Magma Storm PP. The combination of Glare and Substitute often forces faster revenge killers like Zamazenta and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele to accept paralysis if they want to break Serperior's Substitute. Leech Seed is an alternative that enables Serperior to beat threats like Heatran on its own. Tera Steel is a wonderful defensive choice that helps against the likes of Tapu Lele, Weavile, and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T, and it completely shuts down walls like Galarian Slowking alongside Substitute. 56 HP EVs make sure that Serperior can keep its Substitute from being broken by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Ferrothorn's Power Whip. Tera Blast with an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and Tera Ground can be chosen over Substitute to hit foes like Heatran and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Rock trades Serperior's ability to break past Heatran and Galarian Slowking to beat Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona as well as Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, and Flyinium Z Tornadus-T. Wallbreakers that benefits from speed control like Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham appreciate Serperior paralyzing faster foes like Darkrai, Tornadus-T, and Iron Valiant with Glare. Specially defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking can give Serperior a hard time, especially when it's unable to Terastallize, so it is very helpful to have teammates like Landorus-T that can threaten them. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile can both provide Pursuit support for Serperior to pressure Galarian Slowking and Mega Latios, and both of them can also threaten foes like Zapdos and Tornadus-T.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is a great wallbreaker that can also set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge, allowing the team to make progress easier. Razor Shell provides a strong STAB move with a nasty chance to drop the foe's Defense, while Aqua Cutter has perfect accuracy and doesn't make contact, eliminating the risk of Static versus Zapdos and Rocky Helmet versus Landorus-T. Knock Off allows Hisuian Samurott to remove items, especially Heavy-Duty Boots users like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Alomomola. Flip Turn allows for pivoting while doing decent STAB damage. Sacred Sword allows Hisuian Samurott to 2HKO Ferrothorn and OHKO Mega Lopunny, Darkrai, and Mega Tyranitar. Tera Water lets Hisuian Samurott 2HKO defensive Zapdos and OHKO Mega Medicham most of the time. Tera Dark allows Hisuian Samurott to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Tapu Lele. Tera Poison is an alternative choice, providing a resistance to Fighting-type coverage from Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Mega Lopunny, Fairy-type coverage from Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, and U-turn from foes such as Landorus-T. Wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Darkrai, and Urshifu-R appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to chip foes with Ceaseless Edge. Other Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Gliscor are able to run different moves, as Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes itself. Hisuian Samurott is very frail, and it can have trouble switching in safely, so have pivots that can help with this, such as Landorus-T, Corviknight, Tapu Koko, and Alomomola. Despite using Choice Scarf, Hisuian Samurott is outsped and OHKOed by Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder, and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, so checks to these like Heatran, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos help a lot.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Hisuian Samurott is a very threatening wallbreaker that provides invaluable utility to its team with the Spikes laid by Ceaseless Edge. Black Glasses boosts Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge and Sucker Punch to further heights, allowing it to have an easier time breaking through foes such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn with the former while also giving it an easier time dispatching of revenge killers like Kartana and Iron Moth with the latter. Protective Pads lets Hisuian Samurott avoid contact effects from Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Moltres which could otherwise stop or significantly hinder its ability to wallbreak. Tera Dark further amplifies the power of Hisuian Samurott's Dark-type STAB attacks, allowing it to OHKO targets like Mega Medicham with Sucker Punch without Black Glasses while dealing massive damage to defensive cores which could otherwise shrug off Ceaseless Edge even while boosted, such as Zapdos and Skarmory. Alternatively, Tera Poison provides a useful defensive typing that can turn the tables on foes such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, as well as deny Toxic from Alomomola and turn it into setup fodder. Offensive teams that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to punch holes in opposing defensive structures while laying Spikes to help them break such as Kartana, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele make for good teammates. Defensive teams featuring Dondozo have no trouble with taking boosted Ceaseless Edge, so Tapu Koko and Ferrothorn are good teammates to help with this weakness. These two also assist with ensuring Alomomola and Toxapex are no problem for Hisuian Samurott, since they can otherwise threaten with a potential Toxic or Scald. Additionally, opposing offensive teams can make it hard for Hisuian Samurott to find its footing due to its middling Speed stat, so Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham can assist in these matchups while appreciating the Spikes set versus more balanced styles. Teammates who effectively use Knock Off such as Tornadus-T, Weavile, and Ferrothorn are great teammates as they can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Toxapex, making them more susceptible to the Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge.</p>"

      "Sun Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>With Chlorophyll, powerful STAB options in Solar Blade and Close Combat, along with a respectable base 105 Attack stat, Hisuian Lilligant can function as a powerful sun sweeper. It pairs well with the main sun setter, Mega Charizard Y, as it can switch into and threaten Mega Charizard Y’s checks such as Hippowdon, Heatran, and Clodsire; in return, Mega Charizard Y beats its checks like Gholdengo and Mega Scizor, if Hisuian Lilligant lacks Tera Blast. Solar Blade is used for raw power, although Leaf Blade is still an option for consistency outside sun. Tera Blast Fire, especially in sun, gives Lilligant a powerful third STAB option to punish foes that can tank its original STAB combination like Gholdengo, Mega Scizor, and Tera Poison Cresselia. Sleep Powder is an option to shut down checks such as Dragapult or scout for Tera types from Pokemon like Kingambit and Dondozo, which can be used as setup fodders or opportunities to give a free switch to an ally; this also allows Hisuian Lilligant to use Tera Fighting over Tera Fire for more power. Ice Spinner is another option, granting an OHKO on Flying-types that can absorb Hisuian Lilligant's STAB options such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and most Zapdos sets. Hazard support is invaluable in allowing boosted Solar Blade to OHKO Toxapex lacking Heavy-Duty Boots and Mega Scizor, making Great Tusk and Heatran good partners that also passively benefit from the sun. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats once the sun ends, so it appreciates a sturdy defensive core to back it up; Toxapex, Heatran, and Great Tusk can tank hits from and reliably check threats such as Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny once the sun goes down, while Landorus-T and Rotom-W are examples of pivots that can help bring Hisuian Lilligant in more easily.</p>"

      "Hustle Breaker": {
        "description": "<p>Hustle coupled with Victory Dance can be used to break common defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Great Tusk, Landorus, Kingambit, and Heatran; Hisuian Lilligant also outspeeds a good portion of the metagame after a Victory Dance boost, allowing it to threaten even common Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, and Gholdengo. Its main drawback lies in the decrease in accuracy, which makes it inconsistent and potentially easy to KO. Wide Lens can be used to circumvent this, as the accuracy boost will minimize the chances of a miss. Grassium Z can allow Hisuian Lilligant to dismantle defensive cores, letting it OHKO the likes of Toxapex , Landorus-T, and defensive Tornadus-T and heavily damage Zapdos after a Victory Dance and Stealth Rock damage to potentially open up a hole for another ally like Kartana or Volcarona to clean up. Victory Dance allows it to outpace most of the metagame and fire off powerful attacks. Tera Blast Ground allows Hisuian Lilligant to snipe Gholdengo and Skeledirge for super effective damage whilst also notably beating common Poison-types like Toxapex and Sneasler. Sleep Powder can be considered to shut down foes and set up more easily. Ice Spinner is also an option to beat common Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Icium Z is an option when running this, as it allows Hisuian Lilligant to score an OHKO on Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, and defensive Garchomp whilst avoiding Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin chip from the latter two. Hisuian Lilligant has trouble setting up, as it is frail enough to be susceptible to the multitude of offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its inconsistent accuracy may also sometimes leave it open to attacks. Thus, dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko is beneficial, although it should be noted that the latter summons Electric Terrain, which nullifies Sleep Powder. Entry hazard support is important to score OHKOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Bloom Doom OHKOes Toxapex and Tornadus lacking Heavy-Duty Boots after Stealth Rock damage. As such, Garchomp and Ferrothorn are examples of good entry hazard setters. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant can still be defensively checked by Pokemon like Zapdos, if lacking Ice Spinner, Volcarona, and defensive Gholdengo; allies that can beat these checks include Volcarona and Mega Diancie.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots is the standard item for Alomomola; however if a team lacks a way to punish contact moves and has sufficient hazard removal, then Rocky Helmet should be considered. Tera Dragon allows Alomomola to check Mega Charizard Y and Tapu Koko missing Dazzling Gleam, while Tera Fairy improves its matchup against Choice Band Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny, and Tera Poison provides a Toxic immunity and checks Iron Valiant. Common Pokemon unhindered by Toxic use Alomomola as setup fodder, such as Gliscor, Substitute variants of Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor. Rocky Helmet users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory can punish the use of Flip Turn, along with Water Absorb Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W and some Clodsire variants can prevent the move from having any effect. Spikes, in conjunction with Knock Off from users like Mega Scizor, Hisuian Samurott, and Ferrothorn can also be extremely lethal to Alomomola. Knock Off can be used to cripple Pokemon that heavily rely on Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers, such as Zapdos, opposing Alomomola, Heatran, and Landorus-T, or Scald to threaten Kartana and Mega Scizor; but it should be noted that not using Toxic gives free setup turns to dangerous foes like Volcarona and Calm Mind Iron Valiant. Running a Sassy nature allows Alomomola to check Mega Diancie, while a Relaxed nature helps Alomomola pivot around Great Tusk. Teammates such as Ting-Lu and Heatran both take great advantage of Alomomola's support and can help shore up some of Alomomola's weaknesses, checking Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Volcarona, while more offensive partners like Zapdos and Gouging Fire can cover some of these weaknesses while also offsetting Alomomola's passivity, the former answering Kartana, and Zamazenta while the latter helps with Tapu Koko and Zapdos.</p>"

Leech Seed is Ferrothorn’s main form of recovery, letting it slowly wear down and pressure its switch-ins while also sustaining itself. Gyro Ball is a strong STAB option that allows Ferrothorn to put significant pressure on Tornadus-T, Dragonite, and Serperior, which can otherwise setup on it safely, and deter Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele from switching in. Thunder Wave lets Ferrothorn immediately cripple switch-ins like Volcarona, Heatran, and Kartana, while Knock Off removes items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and opposing Ferrothorn, respectively, making them more susceptible to its entry hazards. Tera Ghost lets Ferrothorn flip its matchup against Pokemon using Fighting-type moves such as Superpower Ogerpon-W, Mega Medicham, or Zamazenta in a pinch, as well as block Great Tusk’s Rapid Spin and become neutral to Fire-type moves. The given EV spread allows Ferrothorn to survive a +2 Knock Off from Mega Mawile while otherwise maximizing its special bulk in order to handle threats like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele better. Due to Ferrothorn’s limited longevity, it fits best on offensively geared teams that appreciate the constant pressure it applies to Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex with its entry hazards, making Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny fantastic partners. Due to Ferrothorn’s lack of longevity, pairing it with a sturdy defensive backbone on more balanced structures with Pokemon like Toxapex, Clefable, and Alomomola is important, with the latter especially useful due to it being able to pass Wish to keep Ferrothorn healthy. These Pokemon also check pesky Fire- and Fighting-types such as Volcarona, Mega Lopunny, and Zamazenta for Ferrothorn, while in return Ferrothorn deals with Grass- and Psychic-types such as Kartana and Tapu Lele that these Pokemon struggle with. Other Pokemon that can set entry hazards, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Heatran, work well with Ferrothorn to form a potent hazard-stacking core, significantly pressuring Defog users such as Landorus-T and Tornadus-T with Toxic, Knock Off, and Gyro Ball, maximizing the chip damage dealt.</p>"

Fire Blast complements Dark Pulse and Draco Meteor very well, hitting Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Kingambit. Flash Cannon allows Hydreigon to hit Fairy-types that would otherwise pivot into it, such as Mega Diancie and Iron Valiant, as well as hitting Mega Tyranitar moderately hard. U-turn is an alternative over the latter two moves that provides a more risk-free option to exploit Hydreigon's checks, giving Pokemon like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny free entry. Tera Dark further boosts Hydreigon’s power, allowing its Dark Pulse to reliably 2HKO the likes of Toxapex and Heatran. Hydreigon fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that have reliable options to switch it in safely. Hydreigon pairs very well with pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T, as they can switch it in against opposing defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W. Assault Vest Tornadus-T pairs particularly well with Hydreigon, as it notably checks Dragapult, as well as providing insurance against foes such as Iron Valiant. Pokemon that can exploit common switch-ins to Hydreigon such as Mega Tyranitar and Kingambit pair well with Hydreigon, meaning the likes of Great Tusk and Zamazenta are good partners.

Flame Body allows it to punish careless contact moves from Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, non-Protective Pads Meowscarada, and Mega Scizor. Tera Grass powers up Giga Drain while turning Volcarona's Water weakness into a resistance, allowing it to safely take on threats such as Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. Alternatively, Tera Ground allows Volcarona to dodge revenge killing attempts from the likes of Iron Boulder while powering up Hidden Power Ground to let it potentially OHKO Gouging Fire at +1. Due to Volcarona's high threat level, common attempts to check it involve using Terastallization on a defensive Pokemon, such as Heatran or Alomomola; as such, partners like Raging Bolt and Kyurem appreciate Volcarona forcing those Pokemon to Terastallize. Grass-types like Serperior are also great partners, as they can bait in Heatran for Volcarona while being able to switch in situationally on Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R that threaten it out. Serperior can also force progress with Glare on threats like Gouging Fire or setting up with Leaf Storm while chipping checks like Raging Bolt. Dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl are also good teammates to allow Volcarona to set up far more easily and win games quickly.</p>"

      "Bulky Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Due to its typing, ability, and the combination of Quiver Dance and Roost, Defensive Quiver Dance Volcarona is a powerful late-game sweeper and a decent pivot against Fairy- and Fighting-type moves such as Iron Valiant's Moonblast as well as Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta's Close Combat. Hidden Power Ground is an alternative to hit foes like Heatran, Garganacl, Mega Diancie, and Raging Bolt. Giga Drain can be paired with Tera Grass to provide coverage against Rock-types like Garganacl and Mega Diancie, as well as Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Alomomola, and Mega Swampert, and it helps to keep Volcarona healthy without sacking momentum to use Roost. Roost makes sure that Volcarona can check foes like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny in the long run and win the 1v1 against Tapu Lele and Darkrai without being chipped severely. Tera Grass gives Giga Drain a STAB boost and removes Volcarona's weakness to Water-types, which can be useful against offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and rain. Tera Steel allows Volcarona to turn walls relying on Toxic to make progress into its setup fodder, examples of which are Alomomola and Blissey. It also provides Volcarona with better matchups against the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Mega Diancie. The above EVs make sure that Volcarona can survive the damage from Stealth Rock twice and outspeed Zamazenta at +1. Teammates like Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W can lure in walls like Ferrothorn and provide Volcarona with great opportunities to set up. They can also handle specially defensive foes like Heatran and Galarian Slowking for Volcarona when it's not equipped with Hidden Power Ground. Since it heavily relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to prevent entry hazard damage, Volcarona appreciates teammates like Gliscor and Mega Tyranitar to absorb Knock Off from foes like Landorus-T. It also benefits from teammates like Ferrothorn and Landorus-T checking Dragonite. Great Tusk and Landorus-T can relieve Volcarona of pressure from Stealth Rock by using Rapid Spin and Defog respectively when Volcarona loses its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>A fantastic Speed tier, a diverse movepool, and Regenerator allow Tornadus-T to be one of the tier's defining pivots, switching into various fixtures such as Zamazenta, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn. Knock Off complements its STAB Hurricane exceptionally well, denting Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Zapdos and Heatran as well as other bulky pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, opening them up to entry hazard chip damage. Tornadus-T is an excellent Defogger, with positive matchups against popular entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Ting-Lu. If these talents are not needed, it can use alternative options like Heat Wave to shatter Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn while preventing Mega Mawile and Corviknight from switching in freely and Toxic to hinder the likes of Tapu Koko and Raging Bolt. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to generate momentum by bringing in wallbreaking teammates such as Tapu Lele and Weavile against passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, whereas Taunt suppresses these Pokemon by denying them opportunities to heal while crucially preventing Spikes Gliscor from beating Tornadus one-on-one with Toxic. Flyinium Z bypasses Hurricane's shaky accuracy and provides a useful damage boost to take out the likes of weakened Toxapex, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots maximizes Tornadus-T's longevity and capability to use Defog. An EV spread of 184 HP / 108 Def / 216 Spe pairs with the Z-Move to survive Zamazenta's Stone Edge after Stealth Rock while outspeeding Iron Valiant. Alternatively, 244 HP / 48 SpD / 216 Spe should be used on Heavy-Duty Boots sets to survive Iron Valiant's Choice Specs Tera Fairy Moonblast. On Heavy-Duty Boots sets, Tera Steel improves Tornadus-T's matchup against Tapu Lele and Mega Scizor and gives it an immunity to Toxic, which can aid it against Toxapex and Alomomola, whereas Tera Grass lets it keep its natural resistance to Ground and Grass while giving it resistances to Electric and Water to aid against Rotom-W and Ogerpon-W. Tornadus-T pairs fantastically with other Regenerator pivots such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking, as they form a double Regenerator core with it while pivoting into faster Pokemon that threaten it such as Mega Lopunny, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. In return, Tornadus-T checks Ground- and Grass-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Kartana. Sturdy defensive stalwarts such as Ferrothorn and Gliscor help against Pokemon Tornadus-T fails to check, such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Heatran. Offensive Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Weavile, and Tapu Lele use Tornadus-T's tendency to force in the likes of Galarian Slowking and Zapdos to find opportunities to wallbreak effectively while appreciating its consistent entry hazard removal keeping them in good condition. Tornadus-T appreciates having solid switch-ins to Mega Tyranitar and Weavile such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, which can enter the field on attempts to Pursuit trap Tornadus-T.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>With a Nasty Plot set, Tornadus-T becomes excellent against bulkier teams that lack speed control able to consistently outpace it and have a relative lack of offensive pressure, allowing it to regain its health with Regenerator to consistently wallbreak. Bleakwind Storm is an alternative to Hurricane to be more consistent with its higher accuracy, although it lacks Hurricane's power and confusion chance to properly disrupt defensive teams. Hurricane should be paired with Flyinium Z to bypass its poor accuracy with a stronger Z-Move compared to Bleakwind Storm. Focus Blast covers Mega Tyranitar, Garganacl, and Heatran, whereas Heat Wave stings Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor consistently but makes Tornadus-T completely helpless against Mega Tyranitar's Pursuit trapping. Taunt bypasses defensive counterplay such as Gliscor's Toxic, Clefable's Thunder Wave, and Ferrothorn's Leech Seed, whereas Knock Off allows Tornadus-T to wear down checks such as Rotom-W, Galarian Slowking, and Zapdos alongside entry hazard support, although a potential Static paralysis from Zapdos ruins it. Defog is an option for Tornadus-T to double as a balance-breaker and entry hazard remover with positive matchups against the likes of Landorus-T and Ferrothorn. Flyinium Z turns Hurricane into a devastating nuke without its poor accuracy to OHKO the likes of Galarian Slowking, Toxapex, and Mega Latias after a boost, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots grants Tornadus-T greater longevity to consistently pivot into the likes of Toxapex's Scald, Ferrothorn's Power Whip, and Clefable's Moonblast while using Regenerator to maintain health and PP stall these attacks when Stealth Rock is present. Tera Flying on Heavy-Duty Boots sets powers up Bleakwind Storm to OHKO Gliscor after a boost. 4 HP EVs maximize Tornadus-T's recovery from Regenerator. Tornadus-T can be a fantastic wincon on balance and bulky balance teams using Spikes, as many of its checks such as Heatran and Ting-Lu are hindered by Spikes, it can outlast these checks due to its fantastic passive longevity. As such, defensive Spikes users such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory pair fantastically with Tornadus-T to aid it while also checking faster revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Other defensive staples such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Clefable prevent other revenge killers such as Weavile, Zamazenta, and Darkrai from using Tornadus-T as an entry point to wallbreak while generally matching up positively against offense teams with Toxic Spikes, keeping Tornadus-T's teammates healthy with Wish, and supporting it with Thunder Wave, respectively. In return, Tornadus-T rips open popular defensive cores involving opposing Toxapex and Gliscor that they fail to make progress against. Other bulky progress makers such as Mega Latias and Swords Dance Gliscor make for a good pairing with Tornadus-T, as one can weaken or impair the likes of Galarian Slowking, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos for the other to wallbreak.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Tornadus-T acts as a soft check to many special attackers, such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona, safely switching in and out of these threats thanks to Regenerator. It can use its Speed and respectable power to outspeed and threaten out foes like the aforementioned Pokemon, allowing it to either bring teammates in safely with U-turn, deal free damage to a switch-in, or cripple the switch-in with Knock Off. Knock Off allows Tornadus-T to remove crucial items from switch-ins, like Leftovers from Heatran and Heavy-Duty Boots from Zapdos. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to threaten Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Tera Steel lets Tornadus-T flip its matchup against foes like Iron Boulder and Tapu Koko and crucially resist Stealth Rock instead of being weak to it. Tera Fighting with Superpower over Heat Wave is an option to easily beat Darkrai and lure Mega Tyranitar. The given Speed EVs allow Tornadus-T to outspeed Iron Valiant, 244 HP maximizes Regenerator recovery, and the remainder is dumped into Special Defense. Tornadus-T works best on offensive teams that have the firepower to make use of the free switches that it forces. Packing wallbreakers like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant to come in on Tornadus-T's checks like Blissey, Heatran, and Raging Bolt is required to make full use of its pivoting. Carrying Assault Vest means that Tornadus-T lacks Heavy-Duty Boots and cannot use Defog, meaning that it requires heavy support in clearing entry hazards, especially since it is weak to Stealth Rock. Therefore, hazard removers like Landorus-T and Rotom-W are good allies; they also cover its weaknesses to Electric and Ice, respectively. Both of these examples have ways to deal with scary physical attackers, with Intimidate on Landorus-T and Will-O-Wisp on Rotom-W. Knock Off absorbers like Mega Scizor and Gliscor are also good teammates, as Tornadus-T does not appreciate losing its item to foes like Landorus-T and opposing Tornadus-T. Finally, other allies to cover its weaknesses to common foes like Raging Bolt, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar are appreciated, making Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Alomomola good teammates; Ferrothorn sets hazards, which is synergistic with Tornadus-T removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Zapdos and Skeledirge, while the last two along with Landorus-T and Rotom-W are also notable for being fellow pivots, forming a simple pivoting core with Tornadus-T.</p>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Landorus-T is the quintessential defensive pivot for many offense and balance teams, combining a unique blend of defensive prowess and utility to perform as a stellar support Pokemon. Intimidate gives Landorus-T the ability to pivot into many of the tier's physical attackers like Gouging Fire, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham, and while it may fear Ice Punch from the latter two, they will still be left with reduced Attack allowing teammates to have an easier time pivoting around them. Additionally, a crucial immunity to both Ground- and Electric-type attacks provides valuable role compression for offensive teams, helping deter the likes of Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Landorus-T from freely attacking. Leftovers provides passive recovery and longevity, but Rocky Helmet can be used instead on more aggressive teams that appreciate its ability to chip down threats like Mega Lopunny and Zamazenta. Toxic gives Landorus-T the ability to put a timer on foes such as Zapdos and opposing Landorus-T as well as setup sweepers like Dragonite, while common Pokemon immune to Toxic such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking fear taking an Earthquake, rendering them unable to safely absorb it. Due to Landorus-T's ability to hit the field plenty of times over the course of a game, it is the single most effective and splashable Stealth Rock setter in the metagame. Defog is also within its wheelhouse due to naturally positive matchups versus common Stealth Rock users like Heatran and Garganacl as well as the more niche Ting-Lu. Taunt is an alternative option to prevent Defog from opposing Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos, and should be used with 76 Speed EVs to outspeed the latter two. Although Taunt is generally preferred on Stealth Rock sets, it can be used on Defog variants as well due to its ability to prevent both Toxic and additional hazards from opposing Landorus-T and Gliscor. Tera Water grants Landorus-T the ability to flip its weaknesses to Water- and Ice-type attacks from the likes of Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Weavile while pivoting out and dealing large damage to the latter two with U-turn. Furthermore, it provides a temporary backbone for its team versus physical wallbreakers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda found on rain teams, which could otherwise run over the offensive structures Landorus-T is typically found on. Teammates that appreciate Landorus-T pivoting into Ground-, Fighting-, and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Garchomp, Zamazenta, and Tapu Koko while maintaining momentum for its team, such as Galarian Slowking, Darkrai, and Tornadus-T, make for great teammates. Defensively, foes capable of absorbing the combination of Earthquake and Toxic like Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight prove to be difficult for Landorus-T to make progress against; however, with U-turn it can pivot out of these Pokemon and create opportunities for teammates such as Ogerpon-W, Volcarona, and Tapu Koko. Taunt variants, on the other hand, struggle to significantly threaten Ground-immune foes, often inviting in dangerous threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W; teammates that check these like Dragonite, Tapu Koko, and Ferrothorn are appreciated. Offensively, teams relying on Landorus-T as a physically defensive backbone may struggle with Ogerpon-W, Weavile, and Iron Defense Zamazenta; these weaknesses can be supported by pairing it with Dragonite, Mega Scizor, Volcarona, and Tapu Lele. The aforementioned Mega Scizor also helps by absorbing Knock Off from Kartana and Mega Tyranitar that would otherwise impair Landorus-T’s longevity, which is usually only supplemented by Leftovers.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {},
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a great choice of role compression with various utilities such as a Ground- and Electric-type immunity, a soft check into Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham, speed control, and sometimes even a late-game cleaner. Thanks to Intimidate and a powerful Earthquake, Landorus-T has plentiful opportunities to pivot on forced switches with U-turn against threats like Iron Boulder and Galarian Slowking. Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Zapdos, Moltres, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T as well as Volcarona. Defog is very effective since most entry hazard setters like Heatran, Mega Diancie, and Garganacl don't like being hit by Earthquake, which prevents them from staying in against Landorus-T and gives it easy opportunities to Defog. Explosion as an alternative allows Landorus-T to trade with threats like Ogerpon-W, Darkrai, and Mega Lopunny as well as weakened checks like Gliscor, especially when Landorus-T is low HP. Tera Water removes Landorus-T's weakness against Water-types like Urshifu-R, Mega Swampert, and Hisuian Samurott, as well as common Ice-type moves like Ice Beam from Darkrai and Ice Shard from Weavile, and also gives Landorus-T a chance to revenge kill Volcarona. The given EVs make sure that Landorus-T outspeeds Zamazenta and survives a Choice Specs Moonblast from Iron Valiant and two Zen Headbutt from Mega Medicham after Stealth Rock. Teammates like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Darkrai appreciate Landorus-T for bringing them in safely via U-turn. In return, they can threaten walls like Alomomola and Gliscor for Landorus-T. Landorus-T can be worn down quickly due to Stealth Rock and its lack of recovery, so teammates like Alomomola and Ferrothorn are helpful to protect it from being overwhelmed too quickly by foes like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny, both of which can also check Water-types like Mega Swampert for Landorus-T. Additionally, Alomomola can heal Landorus-T with Wish and form a pivoting core with it. Other pivots like Rotom-W and Iron Crown bring in Landorus-T safely and form VoltTurn cores with it.</p>"

Explosion lets Landorus-T deal massive damage once its job is done, being able to take a good chunk of damage out of almost any foe while also denying hazard removal from the aforementioned Defoggers and Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Tera Ghost prevents any hazards on the field from being removed by Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk if it's unable to safely use Explosion on it. Ogerpon-W is great offensive partner, as it’s able to come in on Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R which threatens Landorus-T. Volcarona is another solid teammate that’s able to switch into Weavile’s Triple Axel and has a chance to burn it in the process.</p>"}

Substitute lets it take advantage of Pokemon that cannot heavily damage it, like Toxapex and Rotom-W, as well as Pokemon it scares out like Gliscor and Gastrodon while also making itself safer against revenge killers like Iron Valiant and Mega Lopunny, forcing them to get rid of its Substitute before being able to threaten it out. Tera Water and Tera Fairy are Kyurem's main Tera types, as these let it change its defensive matchups behind Substitute making it harder for the likes of Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Garganacl to remove its Substitute. Tera Ground is another alternative to give Kyurem STAB on Earth Power, notably dealing more damage against Steel-types that aren't weak to Ground, like Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. The EV Spread lets Kyurem hit 405 HP, meaning that its Substitute takes two Seismic Toss to remove. Teammates that struggle with the Flying-, Water-, and Ground-types that Kyurem preys on like Ogerpon-W, Gliscor, and Tapu Koko make for excellent teammates, as they appreciate its ability to deal with the Pokemon they can't. Resilient defensive partners like Alomomola, Clefable, and Galarian Slowking help switch into revenge killers like Iron Boulder and Zamazenta that force Kyurem out.

Choice Scarf users and other fast Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Hawlucha greatly appreciate Kyurem's breaking prowess, as they can sweep teams much more easily after it has wreaked havoc on the opposing team. Dual screens support from teammates like Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl are also incredible alongside Kyurem, giving it more opportunites to set up as well as hindering revenge killing attemps from the likes of Mega Medicham and Mega Scizor. Bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Alomomola are able to withstand Kyurem's attacks even after a boost, making wallbreakers like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant good teammates, as they can use them for opportunities to switch in, or weaken them down so Kyurem can take them out. Consistent entry hazard removal is also much appreciated thanks to its weakness to hazards, making partners like Great Tusk and Landorus-T fantastic.</p>"

Substitute is the premier choice, as it enables Hawlucha to take advantage of passive foes like Ferrothorn, Alomomola, and Landorus-T and punish the foes it forces to switch out by setting up. Encore is an alternative option that turns setup sweepers like Swords Dance Gliscor into setup fodder and locks defensive pieces like Alomomola and Corviknight into status moves. Tera Flying removes Hawlucha's weakness to Psychic- and Fairy-type foes like Iron Crown, Clefable, and Iron Valiant and makes Acrobatics a terrifying STAB move that OHKOes Zamazenta with Dauntless Shield active and Landorus-T after Stealth Rock at +2. Tera Electric, on the other hand, makes Hawlucha resist Electric-type moves, notably Thunderclap from Raging Bolt, and it also allows Hawlucha to ignore Static from Zapdos and benefit from Terrain effects. The given EVs can allow Hawlucha to take a Moonblast from Clefable and outspeed Excadrill in sand. A good Terrain setter like Tapu Koko, Rillaboom, or Tapu Lele is necessary for Hawlucha to sweep. Tapu Koko can either set up dual screens to help Hawlucha set up or threaten Water- and Flying-types like Alomomola, Corviknight, and Tornadus-T for it. Rillaboom also helps with aforementioned Water-types and Landorus-T for Hawlucha. Both of them can pressure Dondozo for Hawlucha and pivot it in. Tapu Lele, on the other hand, enables an even more offensive playstyle with teammates like Armarouge, Iron Crown, and Polteageist for Hawlucha, which tears the opponent's defensive core in a pinch with powerful special attacks and appreciates Hawlucha threatening Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Hawlucha dislikes foes that punish contact moves, such as Rocky Helmet Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Volcarona, which makes Knock Off support from the likes of Rillaboom and Iron Valiant greatly appreciated. Due to its mediocre offensive stats, it also benefits from wallbreakers with immediate power like Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Hawlucha is prone to priority move users like Raging Bolt and Weavile before Terastallizing, so it is useful to have teammates like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele to threaten them.</p>"

Diamond Storm is used over Power Gem to dent common defensive checks harder like Galarian Slowking and Tera Grass Heatran. Moonblast is an amazing STAB move that crushes Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Mega Tyranitar while doing very considerable damage to Landorus-T. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types that Mega Diancie would be checked by, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight. If a hazard setter is already present, Earth Power can be used alongside Mystical Fire to pressure Pokemon like Heatran, Toxapex, and Iron Crown. Other niche options like Encore and Protect are also usable, with the former allowing Mega Diancie to lock Pokemon like Raging Bolt and Gliscor into setup moves and the latter letting it scout foes like Landorus-T and Mega Medicham. 28 Attack EVs let Mega Diancie 2HKO Galarian Slowking with Diamond Storm. A Naive nature lets Mega Diancie stave off physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Mega Tyranitar more, while a Hasty nature improves its matchup against special attackers like Tornadus-T and Darkrai. While Mega Diancie is an amazing offensive Pokemon, it often lacks opportunities to wallbreak due to its frailty. Defensive pivots like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking can deal with revenge killers to Mega Diancie like Mega Lopunny, Rillaboom, and Iron Valiant, respectively. In return, Mega Diancie can stack entry hazards in tandem with the aforementioned pivots, forming a good balance core that wears down teams with ease. Offensive Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Darkrai appreciate Mega Diancie dealing with foes like Raging Bolt and Mega Tyranitar; said offensive Pokemon can also mess with common checks to Mega Diancie like Toxapex and Iron Crown.</p>"

Its typing in particular allows it to check common Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Mega Lopunny, Zamazenta, and Urshifu-R while its utility moves like Knock Off and Toxic let it cripple them to benefit teammates. Scald can cripple physical attackers like Garchomp and Mega Medicham, discouraging them from directly switching in to take advantage of Toxapex. Scald’s damage output reduces Toxapex's passivity and is also just enough to threaten Water-weak foes like Landorus-T, Iron Boulder, and Mega Diancie; this allows Toxapex to use Recover or Toxic with general safety. Knock Off allows Toxapex to remove valuable items like Choice items, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Leftovers from switch-ins like Tapu Lele, Zapdos, and Ferrothorn. Toxic Spikes allows Toxapex to pressure offensive teams, forcing them to give up momentum to clear it lest they get poisoned. Haze prevents setup sweepers like Gouging Fire and Iron Valiant from exploiting Toxapex, forcing them to attack, and disrupts wincons like IronPress Zamazenta and Volcarona. An EV spread of 248 HP / 212 Def / 48 SpD with a Bold nature allows Toxapex to maximize its physical bulk while surviving two Scorching Sands from Mega Charizard Y. On the other hand, 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature simply maximizes special bulk. 248 HP EVs are important as it reduces entry hazard damage while benefiting more from Regenerator. Tera Dragon is useful to check Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, the latter of which is especially important on specially defensive sets, Tera Fairy helps versus Raging Bolt and Garchomp, and Tera Steel lets it check Serperior and Tapu Lele. The former two are also notable for removing Toxapex’s Ground weakness versus the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Toxapex, by nature of being a fat wall with little offensive presence, fits like a glove on stall and balance playstyles, sapping momentum but providing valuable utility. Allies on balance that can take advantage of Toxapex through double switches, like Ogerpon-W, Urshifu-R, and Mega Tyranitar, benefit from Toxapex baiting in Ground- and Psychic-types; by using Toxapex as a mid-ground, they can enter the field safely as the opponent switches to a Toxapex check like Gliscor and Choice item Tapu Lele. Teammates that help with the Ground and Psychic weaknesses on the defensive side, such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, are useful as well; in return, Toxapex tanks hits from Ice- and Fighting-types like Weavile, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny for them.</p>"

      "Clangorous Booster": {
        "description": "<p>Kommo-o is a fearsome wallbreaker with its capability to omniboost as soon as it gets an opportunity with Clangorous Soul. Its ability to set up on common Pokemon like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Volcarona and to potentially use Tera Steel to ignore Toxic from defensive Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex allows it to start wallbreaking very early with its powerful coverage. Throat Spray grants an extra Special Attack boost when using Clangorous Soul, whereas Kommonium Z gives it Clangorous Soulblaze, which allows it to deal heavy damage while boosting its stats. Boomburst lets Kommo-o neutrally hit much of the metagame for large damage, which, when coupled with STAB Clanging Scales and Flamethrower as coverage for Steel-types, can easily break cores featuring the likes of Great Tusk, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and more. Bulletproof along with Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to wall Choice Scarf Tapu Lele looking to revenge kill it as well as set up in front of Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult. Tera Normal gives Kommo-o a stronger Boomburst, while Tera Steel gives it a Toxic immunity and useful resistances to all of its weaknesses, allowing Kommo-o to take would-be checks, such as Dragapult, Tapu Lele, Baxcalibur, and Iron Valiant, by surprise and set up in front of them. However, Kommo-o likes to use its Tera and thus denies its teammates this option, and it can be checked by a well-timed Tera from Pokemon such as Tera Steel Garchomp and subsequently be revenge killed. It is also walled by the likes of Heatran, Garganacl, and Clodsire, which can tank its coverage options even without Terastallizing and cripple it with Toxic or Salt Cure or simply force it out and deny future setup opportunities. Finally, due to the nature of Kommo-o’s setup, it can only reasonably do so once per game, making Kommo-o more suited for offensive teams. Thus, having allies that can take care of Kommo-o’s defensive checks before it sets up can allow it to do its job much more effectively; physical attackers like Iron Valiant, offensive Landorus-T, and Samurott-H can pressure and remove checks for Kommo-o to break and potentially sweep. Hazard support is also valuable in preventing opponents from switching back and forth between Pokemon in a Regenerator core; in particular, Assault Vest Tornadus + Toxapex; Pokemon like Great Tusk and Garchomp can set up Stealth Rock to pressure switches.</p>"
      },
      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>With Belly Drum, Kommo-o becomes a fearsome sweeper capable of wiping unprepared teams with relative ease. The HP cuts from Substitute and Belly Drum will immediately activate Salac Berry, giving Kommo-o maximum Attack along with increased Speed to sweep offensive and defensive teams alike. Substitute also allows Kommo-o to dodge status moves like Ferrothorn’s Leech Seed, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Landorus-T's Toxic, and Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp that could potentially ruin Kommo-o’s sweep, instead giving it a free set up opportunity. Drain Punch is chosen over heavier hitting moves like Close Combat, as the extra damage is not needed, and Drain Punch can heal off the HP lost through Belly Drum and Substitute, making Kommo-o harder to revenge kill. Thunder Punch is used to dent and possibly KO common defensive tanks that can survive Drain Punch, like Skarmory, Toxapex, Tera Water Garganacl, Gholdengo, and Tera Flying Kingambit. Bulletproof stacked on top of Tera Steel allows Kommo-o to surprise opponents like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Specs Dragapult looking to revenge kill it. Although Soundproof blocks moves such as Roar from defensive Garchomp and Bug Buzz from Volcarona, it is generally not preferred due to the lack of relevant sound-based moves in comparison to the bevy of aforementioned qualities gained from Bulletproof. Tera Electric can power up Thunder Punch with STAB to score KOs on the likes of Gholdengo, Tapu Lele, and Tera Fairy Kingambit, while Tera Steel gives it useful resistances that may allow it to reach Salac Berry range without Substitute by tanking a resisted hit from the likes of Tapu Lele or Mega Diancie. Belly Drum Kommo-o fits on hyper offensive teams that appreciate its ability to sweep or clean up teams once its checks are removed. Therefore, it appreciates partners that can lure and remove Pokemon like Clodsire, Tera Grass Heatran, Gliscor, and Landorus-T that check it; Tapu Koko in particular is good, as it can run Hidden Power Ice to bait and KO the latter two and badly chip the former two potentially into Kommo-o’s range while also boosting the power of its Thunder Punch by setting Electric Terrain. Belly Drum Kommo-o also has trouble setting up, as it mainly uses the element of surprise to get up a Substitute —namely, it exploits the opponent's fear of Clangorous Soulblaze and thus forces them to switch. Thus, it appreciates dual screens support from the likes of Grimmsnarl in order to more consistently set up Belly Drum.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great Speed, power-boosting ability in Electric Terrain, and access to both U-turn and Volt Switch, Tapu Koko functions as a great offensive pivot. It often utilizes its ability to force out slower foes like Mega Charizard Y, Alomomola, and Hisuian Samurott to safely pivot in wallbreakers that take advantage of Electric Terrain like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and Iron Moth in safely via U-turn or Volt Switch. U-turn is usually favored for its consistency against Ground-types like Gliscor and Clodsire and ability to deal more chip damage to Grass-type Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Serperior; alternatively, Volt Switch has higher damage output and avoids contact punishment from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Volcarona, but being blocked by Ground-type Pokemon makes it less reliable. Hidden Power Ice targets popular Ground-type such as Landorus-T and Gliscor and is the preferred option over Dazzling Gleam. Heavy-Duty Boots complements Tapu Koko's frequent pivoting by negating entry hazard damage, while Electrium Z lets it pick off weakened foes such as Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Volcarona. Due to its typing and mediocre Special Attack stat, Tapu Koko struggles with bulky Ground-type Pokemon like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, as well as sturdy walls like Galarian Slowking, Garganacl, and Ferrothorn; therefore, it needs powerful teammates like Mega Medicham, Iron Valiant, and Hawlucha to break through them. Those teammates also appreciate Tapu Koko checking faster offensive threats such as Tornadus-T, pressuring walls such as Toxapex, and generating momentum for them to make use of. Tapu Koko also has great synergy with the likes of Iron Crown, Landorus-T, and Iron Moth, forming the infamous VoltTurn combo. In the case of Iron Moth and Iron Crown, Tapu Koko’s Electric Surge activates Quark Drive for them. In return, they take care of Tapu Koko’s checks such as Ferrothorn and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Since Tapu Koko is commonly seen as a mere Terrain setter and pivot, it can catch opponents off guard with Choice Specs, luring in Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor and heavily denting them with Hidden Power Ice. Once Ground-types are eliminated, Tapu Koko can also start spamming Volt Switch to overwhelm foes, dealing large amounts of chip damage to facilitate a sweep from allies like Iron Valiant. Additionally, its high Speed and Electric Surge allow it to function as a fast pivot that enables Quark Drive Pokemon such as the aforementioned Iron Valiant and Iron Moth. Dazzling Gleam is a secondary STAB move that can be used as a safe mid-ground option to hit Ground-types for decent damage when using Hidden Power Ice is risky, and it also hits foes like Mega Latias and Zamazenta harder than Tapu Koko's other moves. Tera Electric allows Tapu Koko to clean up with Thunderbolt once Electric-immune foes are defeated, but Tapu Koko should still primarily be used as an enabler for allies like Iron Valiant and Iron Crown and thus should generally not waste Tera. Choice Specs Tapu Koko should be paired with allies that benefit from Landorus-T's and Gliscor's absences. For example, Iron Crown has a much easier time setting up without worrying about a stray Earthquake, Iron Moth has trouble with Gliscor and benefits from its absence as well as the presence of Electric Terrain, Hawlucha becomes a deadly sweeper with one of its biggest checks removed, and Iron Valiant's Swords Dance variants become very potent without Landorus-T to stop them. There are a few defensive Pokemon, such as Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn, that can stop Tapu Koko easily; therefore, teammates that can threaten these foes such as Weavile and Iron Moth are useful. Finally, entry hazards are useful to whittle down Gliscor into KO range of Hidden Power Ice, so Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Iron Treads, and Landorus-T are useful.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Access to Light Screen and Reflect alongside an excellent Speed tier allows Tapu Koko to function as an effective dual screens setter in hyper offense teams. Taunt is a powerful tool on Tapu Koko, allowing it to prevent the use of Defog from the likes of Tornadus-T and Corviknight, deny setup from Pokemon such as Volcarona, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt, and prevent opposing leads, such as Landorus-T and Ribombee, from setting up entry hazards. Tera Ghost is used solely for blocking Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, whereas Tera Flying allows Tapu Koko to safely set up dual screens in front of Ground-type Pokemon such as Gliscor and Landorus-T, though it should be noted that Tapu Koko rarely Terastallizes. Tapu Koko's Electric Surge is a powerful tool, allowing Hawlucha to reliably activate Unburden while also activating Quark Drive from the likes of Iron Valiant, Iron Crown, and Iron Boulder. Setup sweepers such as Volcarona, Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor appreciate Tapu Koko's dual screens, which allow for easier setup. Defog is able to remove Tapu Koko's dual screens and Electric Terrain, making Serperior, Encore variants of Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W, and Taunt from Hisuan Samurott and Landorus-T solid options to use alongside Tapu Koko, as they can punish Defog users. Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Iron Moth are able to outspeed and threaten to KO Tapu Koko, making teammates that can take advantage of them, such as Iron Valiant, Mega Gyarados, and Dragonite, excellent partners.</p>"

Additionally, Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves like Mega Lopunny's Fake Out and Weavile's Ice Shard, which is useful for Tapu Lele itself and teammates that aim for a sweep such as Hawlucha and Volcarona. Focus Blast lets Tapu Lele hit common Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Psyshock allows Tapu Lele to hit foes with weaker Defense stats like Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Volcarona, along with shutting down Calm Mind Tera Poison Cresselia. Future Sight can be used to hit in tandem with teammates such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta, threatening Toxapex and Zapdos looking to switch into their attacks. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire nails Mega Scizor along with hitting Ferrothorn more consistently than Focus Blast. Tera Psychic is the premier Tera option, as it boosts Tapu Lele's Psychic STAB attacks to ludicrous heights, smashing through most neutral targets such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko. Tera Fairy is a niche alternative, boosting Moonblast to powerful levels while minimizing the threat of Pursuit from Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Despite having Focus Blast, Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn are still effective checks to Tapu Lele, so teammates such as Gliscor and Mega Lopunny can be used to mitigate this. Hawlucha can both utilize Psychic Terrain to activate Unburden while helping break through Mega Scizor, allowing Tapu Lele to clean up with ease late-game.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Tapu Lele is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the tier, having no commonly used consistent defensive checks. Hidden Power Fire can OHKO most Mega Scizor and deal heavy damage to Ferrothorn without the chance of missing, unlike Focus Blast. Focus Blast hits Heatran and Ferrothorn and OHKOes Mega Tyranitar. Psyshock can hit Galarian Slowking, 2HKO Chansey, and OHKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Future Sight can help teammates like Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny wallbreak, as it deals good damage to switch-ins like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Landorus-T. Late-game cleaners like Mega Lopunny, Volcarona, Urshifu-R, and Bulk Up Great Tusk really appreciate Tapu Lele's ability to force damage onto would-be checks such as Corviknight and Heatran. However, Tapu Lele is very prediction reliant and can often invite in Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Iron Crown, and Mega Scizor. Additionally, it struggles against common revenge killers such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny. Therefore, a strong defensive core is recommended when building around Tapu Lele to minimize the impact of these offensive threats, especially having a switch-in to the aforementioned Steel-types that may come in on a Psychic or Moonblast. Good switch-ins to these include Heatran and Alomomola, with the latter serving as a pivot with Flip Turn to safely get Tapu Lele on the field against passive foes like Toxapex and Gliscor.</p>"

Although Tapu Lele is a fearsome wallbreaker, it requires a Calm Mind boost to heavily damage the majority of the metagame, so Pokemon that can provide it a setup opportunity via pivoting such as Urshifu-R, Gliscor, and Alomomola are beneficial. Tapu Lele is also very prone to getting revenge killed by physical attackers that can bypass Tapu Lele's Special Defense boosts, such as Zamazenta, Kartana, and Weavile, so teammates such as Zapdos, Moltres, and Toxapex are appreciated.</p>"}

It also provides Grassy Terrain for its team, giving passive recovery to teammates like Heatran and Toxapex, making them even harder to deal with. Close Combat hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Kingambit and Stone Edge threaten Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Dragonite while letting Tapu Bulu beat Volcarona. Rockium Z gives Tapu Bulu a strong nuke, allowing it to break through Zapdos more reliably while also OHKOing would-be checks like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y on the switch-in. Fightinium Z, on the other hand, helps it break through Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor and KOes Heatran after luring it in. Leftovers gives Tapu Bulu more passive recovery, allowing it to set up multiple times against more balanced teams. The given EV spread ensures Tapu Bulu outspeeds Magnezone and Mega Tyranitar while optimizing its bulk. Tera Water retains Tapu Bulu's utility against rain while making it resist Ice-types moves from Pokemon like Weavile and Fire-type moves from Heatran and Volcarona, while Tera Steel avoids Toxic, grants a helpful Flying resistance against the lieks of Tornadus-T and Zados, and synergizes well with Grassy Terrain, as it weakens Earthquake. Both options also let it resist Make It Rain from Gholdengo, allowing Tapu Bulu to win against it thanks to Horn Leech's recovery. Tapu Bulu fits best on offense and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its strong wallbreaking capability. Heatran checks Fire-types like Volcarona and Skeledirge, Flying-types like Tornadus-T, and appreciates Grassy Terrain weakening Earthquake. In return, Tapu Bulu can check Rotom-W and Urshifu-R, using them as setup fodder. Kartana synergizes well with Tapu Bulu, as Tapu Bulu can break through most of Kartana's checks thanks to Z-Moves and boosts its Leaf Blade with Grassy Terrain, letting Kartana clean with its Choice Scarf set. In the same vein, Mega Scizor works well with Tapu Bulu, as together they can overwhelm their common checks, like Zapdos and Heatran.</p>"

It can outspeed and revenge kill foes like Mega Lopunny, Dragapult, Garchomp, and Iron Valiant while using its typing and remarkable bulk to switch into Pokemon like Heatran, Weavile, and Urshifu-R. Other than shutting down problematic setup sweepers like Volcarona, Trick + Taunt improves Tapu Fini's matchup against defensive Pokemon by crippling and shutting down switch-ins such as Ferrothorn, Clodsire, and Toxapex, especially with Misty Terrain to protect it and its teammates against theirs and the likes of Rotom-W, Heatran, and Gastrodon's status moves. If the team lacks an entry hazard remover, Tapu Fini can run Defog if necessary, as it matches up well against entry hazard setters like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. However, its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards and lack of longevity make it a poor candidate to do it consistently. Ice Beam can be run to potentially 2HKO offensive Tornadus-T and OHKO Landorus-T, while Nature's Madness is an option to dent its checks hard—especially ones that lack reliable recovery—such as Ferrothorn, Galarian Slowking, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. However, forgoing Taunt or Defog loses out on Tapu Fini's utility, which makes shutting down walls and supporting its team needlessly more difficult. Tera Steel allows Tapu Fini to emergency check threats like Tapu Lele and Nasty Plot Tornadus-T; it also provides a better defensive typing against walls like Toxapex and Ferrothorn, which is more useful if using Taunt. The Speed EVs allow Tapu Fini to outspeed +1 Mega Gyarados, while the Special Attack EVs allow it to KO Urshifu-R after Stealth Rock. Gholdengo, Tornadus-T, and Ferrothorn are great teammates to deal with faster threats like boosted Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf users such as Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T; Ferrothorn also provides Spikes to chip down foes like Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Garganacl into Tapu Fini's KO range, compensating for its middling damage output. Offensive teammates like Volcarona, Kartana, and Weavile love its Misty Terrain to protect them against debilitating status from walls like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Skeledirge, letting them set up and attack more safely; Volcarona also enjoys Tapu Fini luring in and crippling their shared checks like Toxapex and Clodsire with Trick, while Choice Band Weavile appreciates Tapu Fini removing Stealth Rock with Defog.</p>"

Bulk Up accumulates boosts alongside Pokemon such as Howl Zamazenta, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and defensive Mega Scizor, meaning they cannot overwhelm Buzzwole. Toxic is a niche alternative if Buzzwole's team wishes to play more proactively, as it cripples the likes of Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge that would otherwise take advantage of Buzzwole. Heavy-Duty Boots ignores entry hazards, letting Buzzwole consistently switch into the Pokemon it gets tasked to counter without being worn down. Tera Water gives Buzzwole a Water resistance, allowing it to wall Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Floatzel, and Barraskewda in rain. The given EV spread maximizes Buzzwole's physical bulk while ensuring it always outspeeds Kingambit. Buzzwole fits best on defensive teams, which appreciate it as a fallback measure against the myriad of physical wallbreakers while not caring for its relative passivity. Pokemon such as Clodsire and Hippowdon can shore up Buzzwole's weakness to common special attackers such as Mega Diancie, Dragapult, and Tapu Koko.

Fightinium Z allows unboosted Kartana to OHKO Heatran and Ferrothorn along with Mega Scizor, Mega Mawile, Corviknight, and Raging Bolt after a boost.

Knock Off lets Kartana remove items from defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Skarmory, which makes them more susceptible to entry hazards from its teammates, and it also hits Galarian Slowking hard. Sacred Sword targets Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and opposing Kartana. Smart Strike is Kartana's strongest Steel-type STAB attack for dealing with Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Dragonite. Defog can be used over Smart Strike to guarantee an emergency Defog for teammates like Mega Charizard-Y, which can be used when predicting a switch or while sacrificing Kartana. Tera Grass elevates Leaf Blade's power to incredible levels, which allows Kartana to snowball with greater ease against weakened teams. Tera Dark can be used instead to give Kartana STAB on Knock Off, which becomes extremely spammable against most netural targets.

Heatran can also set up Stealth Rock for Kartana, which synergizes well with Knock Off's removal of Heavy-Duty Boots from Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Kartana also struggles to break through Mega Latias because of its bulk and ability to tank most of Kartana's attacks as well as Zapdos because of its typing and ability to OHKO Kartana with Hurricane. Thus, Pursuit support from the likes of Mega Tyranitar and Choice Band Weavile can help in this regard.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Kartana serves as a good check to Pokemon like Garchomp, Mega Tyranitar, and Ogerpon-W lacking Superpower, while packing good utility with Defog. Its great matchup versus the former two, along with Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn exacerbate this, being particularly one of the most effective Defoggers in the metagame. With Grassium Z, Kartana is even more effective at removing entry hazards, being able to deal a massive blow to Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, KOing even the latter two with minor chip. Knock Off is Kartana's coverage move of choice, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Volcarona while giving it an avenue to make meaningful progress against Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Galarian Slowking. The given EV spread lets Bloom Doom OHKO offensive Garchomp, which could otherwise comfortably tank Leaf Blade and KO Kartana with its +2 Earthquake. Due to Kartana's ability to often lure Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp with its Bloom Doom, Tapu Koko makes for an excellent teammate, also appreciating Kartana's ability to keep Ferrothorn's entry hazards off the field; in return, Tapu Koko can check Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T for Kartana. Teammates that benefit from Kartana’s entry hazard removal like Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y form a nice core with it as well, allowing them to stay healthy and hit the field to help break down Kartana’s checks like Zapdos and Heatran. Kartana is not without flaw as a Defogger; it is most notably helpless against Stealth Rock Heatran, so teammates that assist with Heatran such as Gliscor and Hisuian Samurott work well, being able to often trade entry hazards to help mitigate Kartana's inability to safely clear them in the face of Heatran. Furthermore, Kartana’s terrible Special Defense renders it unable to check Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko effectively unlike other Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran, so teammates like Galarian Slowking, Weavile, and Landorus-T can ease these matchups.</p>"

Wood Hammer is an even stronger STAB move, allowing Rillaboom to dispatch defensive stopgaps like Toxapex and Landorus-T; its recoil is also partially offset by Grassy Terrain recovery. Knock Off lets Rillaboom force progress on its rather limited defensive answers like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos by removing their Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots and making them more prone to being worn down by repeated hits or entry hazards, while Superpower shellacks supposed switch-ins like Heatran and Ferrothorn. U-turn lets Rillaboom pivot itself out from unfavorable matchups against the aforementioned Corviknight, as well as against Dragonite and Mega Scizor, letting it form a pivoting core with teammates like Urshifu-R or switch into threatening teammates like Volcarona and Heatran. Hawlucha in particular greatly benefits from being able to activate Unburden through Grassy Seed, giving it a Defense boost and letting it sweep weakened teams. In return, it threatens the Steel-types that wall Rillaboom, like Ferrothorn and Heatran. Dragon-types like Raging Bolt and Gouging Fire can be massive headaches for Rillaboom, so teammates that can threaten them, like Weavile, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele, are great partners for Rillaboom. On the flip side, teammates like Gouging Fire and Mega Scizor can struggle to break through bulky Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex, a job well-suited for Rillaboom. In return, those teammates appreciate Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain halving the power of miscellaneous uses of Earthquake, while they break through troublesome Steel- and Poison-types like Heatran and Galarian Slowking.</p>"

These traits along with its typing let Cinderace act as a soft check to Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Kartana, and Mega Scizor, which is useful on offense and bulky offense teams. Will-O-Wisp cripples physically offensive Pokemon like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Mega Mawile. Court Change helps temporarily keep off entry hazards, especially from the likes of Ferrothorn, while High Jump Kick OHKOes Mega Tyranitar and deals heavy damage to Heatran and Mega Diancie. The given EV spread allows Cinderace to outspeed Iron Valiant and 2HKO maximum HP Galarian Slowking with Pyro Ball. Tera Fire bolsters Pyro Ball's damage, letting it OHKO offensive Volcarona and 2HKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Cinderace can form a VoltTurn core with other pivots like Tapu Koko and Meowscarada, as they can take advantage of its checks like Toxapex, Alomomola, and Rotom-W. In return, Cinderace can pivot in to help deal with their checks like Ferrothorn and Heatran. Cinderace struggles to damage defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk, making offensive teammates like Iron Boulder, Meowscarada, and Urshifu-R good options to help weaken or outright OHKO them. Teammates like Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko can benefit from Cinderace's ability to often burn Ground-types like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Garchomp, making it much easier to chip them down while reducing the power of their Ground-type STAB.</p>"

Brave Bird allows Corviknight to not be completely useless against Pokemon like Volcarona, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W. Body Press hits Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Ferrothorn for meaningful damage, preventing them from consistently getting hazards up against Corviknight. U-turn is a vital tool, allowing Corviknight to preserve momentum against Pokemon that counter it, such as Raging Bolt and Heatran. Iron Defense can be used over Defog if a team already has hazard removal, and it allows Corviknight to boost alongside Pokemon that could otherwise set up on it like Mega Mawile and Mega Scizor while also boosting the damage output of Body Press to monstrous levels. Iron Defense can also be used over U-turn on stall teams that don’t mind the momentum sink and appreciate Corviknight compressing multiple roles, such as being a check to Mega Gyarados, Mega Mawile, and Tapu Lele; as a Defogger; and as a good wincon. Rocky Helmet is used to punish contact moves from Weavile, Urshifu-R, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom, but Leftovers or Covert Cloak can be used for passive healing or ignoring secondary effects from moves like Tapu Lele’s Psychic and Toxapex’s Scald. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Corviknight to pivot more safely without fearing chip damage from Stealth Rock and more reliably switch in and remove hazards with Defog. Tera Dragon allows Corviknight to gain resistances to Fire- and Electric-type attacks from Mega Charizard Y and Zapdos while also allowing it to check Ogerpon-W and rain sweepers like Barraskewda and Mega Swampert. The first EV spread allows Corviknight to survive a Swords Dance-boosted Continental Crush from Landorus-T, with the remaining EVs dumped into Special Defense to let Corviknight take on Tapu Lele and Mega Latios a bit better. The second EV spread should be used on Iron Defense variants to outspeed uninvested Heatran. Corviknight mainly fits on balance teams, where Pokemon like Toxapex and Mega Tyranitar appreciate its ability to switch into devastating wallbreakers like the aforementioned Tapu Lele, Garchomp, and Rillaboom. Wallbreakers like Iron Valiant and Weavile appreciate Corviknight pivoting them in safely against Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Garchomp because of their frailty. A good defensive backbone that can check Pokemon that threaten Corviknight offensively like Volcarona, Heatran, and Raging Bolt is much appreciated, usually consisting of teammates like Gliscor and Toxapex. Corviknight can also fit on stall teams, which contain teammates like Clodsire and Dondozo that help check Tapu Koko and Gouging Fire are found.</p>"

      "Bulk Up + Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>Substitute + Bulk Up Corviknight is a formidable wincon on balance teams, utilizing its elite bulk in combination with Pressure to PP stall would-be checks like Heatran, Zapdos, and Toxapex while still being a consistent check to Tapu Lele and Calm Mind Iron Valiant. Bulk Up is important for Corviknight to attempt a sweep in the later stages of the game as well as still be a functional check to the likes of Mega Scizor and Swords Dance Gliscor. Substitute lets Corviknight rack up boosts safely on more passive Pokemon like Clefable, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking; it also prevents it from having its Leftovers removed from Knock Off and avoid status while also letting it waste more PP from Heatran's and Zapdos’s attacks. Tera Dragon is extremely important for Corviknight, as it lets it flip the matchup on Fire- and Electric-types like Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-W, turning the latter two into setup fodder. The given EV spread allows Corviknight to live a boosted Continental Crush from Garchomp and outspeed uninvested Mega Scizor, with the rest maximizing its special bulk. Entry hazard support is crucial for Corviknight to sweep, as it needs to waste as much recovery PP as it can from its checks to sweep in the later stages of the game, making Clefable and Gliscor important teammates. Both of these also switch into Toxapex safely, while the latter can also pivot and take advantage of Heatran. Knock Off support further supplements Corviknight by crippling Zapdos, Toxapex, and Rotom-W, making Mega Tyranitar and Weavile good partners. Corviknight can often be worn down easily and forced to waste Roost PP early on if it is the sole defensive pivot, making it inefficient at sweeping, so pairing it up with a sturdy defensive backbone, for example Toxapex + Mega Latias, can help spread the load. Prior to Terastallizing, Corviknight can be forced out by strong Electric- and Fire-types like Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Raging Bolt, so having strong checks to these Pokemon such as the aforementioned Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Draco Meteor Mega Latias is important.</p>"

With Swift Swim, Barraskewda outspeeds nearly the entire metagame, including boosted foes like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and Hawlucha. Liquidation's chance to drop Defense potentially lets Barraskewda beat Pokemon it normally can't on the switch in like Latias and Rotom-W. Aqua Jet allows it to finish off dangerous foes outside of rain like Volcarona and Iron Boulder. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to pivot out on Pokemon like Toxapex and Dondozo while also chipping them and giving a free switch to its teammates like Mega Swampert. Close Combat KOes Ferrothorn and Archaludon after Stealth Rock and can chip Ogerpon-W on the switch. Psychic Fangs is a niche move that allows it to beat Pokemon that it would otherwise struggle against like Toxapex, but it doesn't do much else. Tera Water allows Barraskewda to significantly dent checks like Mega Latias and Rotom-W, as well as potentially breaking Toxapex after Defense drops. Pelipper is necessary teammate to set up rain, remove entry hazards, or pivot out with U-turn and let Barraskewda in safely due to its extreme frailty. Mega Swampert is an important teammate thanks to its immunity to Electric-type attacks from Raging Bolt and Rotom-W; it also threatens Toxapex and can wear down foes like Rotom-W and Ferrothorn so Barraskewda has an easier time muscling past them. Barraskewda is easily revenge killed by Rillaboom and Raging Bolt so defensive teammates like Iron Treads and Ferrothorn are necessary; they can also set up hazards that will wear down Barraskewda's checks like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. Iron Treads in particular is a good partner because it pivots in Barraskewda with Volt Switch and removes hazards so Barraskewda can break through teams more often. In return, Barraskewda forces out Fighting- and Fire-types that check Iron Treads and Ferrothorn such as Mega Lopunny, Iron Valiant, and Volcarona. While it has a great Attack stat, Barraskewda struggles to beat defensive foes that resist Water-type attacks like Dondozo, Alomomola, Dragonite, and Tera Dragon Zapdos, so Archaludon is a good partner to threaten these foes. In return, Barraskewda threatens Ground- and Fire-types that check Archaludon such as Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Volcarona.</p>"

Healing Wish gives Hatterene the ability to fully heal one of its teammates, giving wallbreakers and setup Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Kingambit another chance to break through the opposing team. Mystical Fire is generally preferred over Dazzling Gleam to hit Gholdengo, Ferrothorn, and Kingambit on the switch, but Dazzling Gleam can be used to threaten Dragonite, Garchomp, and Dragapult. Nuzzle provides Hatterene with a way to punish Pokemon that would safely pivot into it otherwise, such as Heatran and Tornadus-T. Eject Button gives Hatterene the ability to take a hit and pivot into a teammate, letting frail wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y and Weavile come onto the field. Tera Steel removes Hatterene's weaknesses to Ghost and Steel, letting it pass a Healing Wish or cripple an opposing Pokemon such as Dragapult and Gholdengo while retaining its advantage against Dragon-types, though typically you would want to Terastallize a teammate for more offensive pressure. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex while maximizing its ability to pivot into physical attacks. Hatterene greatly benefits teams that rely on keeping entry hazards off the field, such as sun teams and some offense teams. As such, Mega Charizard Y is a fantastic partner, as it appreciates Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field and walling Toxapex; in return, it is able to pressure Pokemon Hatterene brings in, such as Gholdengo and Kingambit. Focus Sash users such as Polteageist and Cloyster also make for good teammates thanks to Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards. Similarly, pivots such as Tapu Lele and Dragapult appreciate Hatterene's ability to keep off hazards and give them a second chance with Healing Wish, letting them come in safely and consistently. Hatterene's lack of longevity means that it usually cannot act as the sole form of hazard control. As such, Rapid Spin Great Tusk is a good partner alongside Hatterene for keeping hazards off of the field while also being able to support Mega Charizard Y on sun teams.</p>"

Psyshock lets Hatterene beat opposing Calm Mind and Quiver Dance sweepers like Iron Valiant and Volcarona, while Stored Power lets it bypass Skeledirge with enough Calm Mind boosts. Mystical Fire hits Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Ferrothorn super effectively. Draining Kiss acts as a form of recovery for Hatterene. Tera Water gives Hatterene a solid defensive typing while removing its weakness to Steel-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Mega Scizor. The given EV spread lets Hatterene outspeed Garganacl and Toxapex, letting Hatterene take out Toxapex with an attack before having its boosts removed by Haze. Hatterene works well when paired with Pokemon that dislike entry hazards, such as defensive Pokemon without Heavy-Duty Boots. These include partners like Toxapex and Garganacl, which can check other offensive and defensive Pokemon, giving Hatterene the leeway for a late-game sweep. Flyinium Z Tornadus-T appreciates Hatterene being able to Terastallize to force opposing Gholdengo to Terastallize, as well as keeping hazards off the field for it. Kingambit and Garganacl are great partners for their ability to reliably check Ghost-types like Dragapult and Gholdengo, with Kingambit even being able to Pursuit trap them. Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Mega Scizor can check Kingambit for Hatterene as well. Hatterene's lack of longevity outside of Draining Kiss means that it appreciates a secondary form of entry hazard removal from teammates such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, Great Tusk, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Hatterene enjoys pairing up with Spikes users such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as they pressure the opponent into using Defog, alleviating Hatterene's need to block entry hazards, as well as wearing down Hatterene's answers such as Heatran and Gholdengo.</p>"

Foul Play requires no Attack EVs to function, allowing Grimmsnarl to OHKO several Attack-boosting Pokemon that try to set up on it such as Ogerpon-W and offensive Garchomp. Parting Shot is sometimes used to pivot and force out Mega Diancie, while Thunder Wave is also an option to cripple fast threats. Tera Steel allows Grimmsnarl to resist Fairy attacks from Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant, although using Tera on it is typically not ideal. 140 Special Defense EVs let Grimmsnarl survive two Moonblasts from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele behind Light Screen while the rest of its EVs are dumped into Defense, as most priority moves from Pokemon that can outspeed its Prankster dual screens are physical, such as Fake Out from Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, with Mega Medicham occasionally using Bullet Punch as well. Teammates that benefit from Grimmsnarl's utility are mainly setup sweepers that can blow through most teams if allowed multiple turns of setup, such as Iron Crown, Mega Gyarados, Gouging Fire, Volcarona, and Dragonite, and hard hitting wallbreakers such as Ursaluna, and Mega Mawile that can beat almost anything one-on-one with dual screens up. Strong Fairy-type attackers such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele can often leave Grimmsnarl severely chipped despite Light Screen, hurting its ability to set dual screens later on in the game. Additionally, entry hazard setters who ignore Taunt such as Mega Diancie and Mega Tyranitar give Grimmsnarl and the hyper offense teams it is found on trouble. Teammates like Iron Crown and Mega Mawile can turn these offensive Fairy-types into setup fodder, while teammates such as Urshifu-R can turn Mega Tyranitar and other Dark-types, like Weavile and Hisuian Samurott capable of ignoring Prankster into setup fodder.</p>"

Trailblaze is the recommended move for the last slot as it allows Urshifu-R to avoid revenge killing from naturally fast Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Thunder Punch is an alternative that threatens Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Alomomola. Tera Steel is advised for preventing revenge killing from the likes of Tornadus-T, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, while granting a Toxic immunity allowing it to use Alomomola as setup fodder. If using Thunder Punch, however, Tera Electric is recommended to meaningfully threaten Toxapex and Slowbro notably letting Urshifu-R OHKO Toxapex with Tera Electric Thunder Punch after a boost. Protective Pads is recommended to ignore problematic abilities like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, Static, and Flame Body, from Pokemon like Garchomp, Ferrothorn, Zapdos, and Moltres. Urshifu-R has a hard time sweeping without Trailblaze, so defensive options to fall back on like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Garganacl, and Zapdos are appreciated.

Aqua Jet allows Urshifu-R to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as chipped Mega Diancie and Volcarona. Thunder Punch can deal considerable damage to the likes of Toxapex and Slowbro. Urshifu-R makes use of Tera Water to deal massive damage with Surging Strikes and force its typical checks like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Galarian Slowking to switch out. It appreciates teammates like Galarian Slowking due to its ability to set Future Sight to break past Toxapex and Alomomola and Mega Scizor, which can also cover Urshifu-R's bad matchup against Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Both Galarian Slowking and Mega Scizor are able to pivot, bringing Urshifu-R in safely against Pokemon such as Heatran and Mega Tyranitar.

Addtionally, Surging Strikes allows Urshifu-R to OHKO Focus Sash users like Glimmora and Landorus-T while also improving its matchup against Zamazenta, bypassing its Dauntless Shield Defense boost. U-turn provides Urshifu-R the utility to gain momentum from its checks like Alomomola, Slowbro, Toxapex, and Corviknight. Aqua Jet can serve as a backup plan to revenge kill faster setup sweepers like Volcarona, while Thunder Punch can hit bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Slowbro as well as Corviknight. Tera Water enables Urshifu-R to achieve valuable OHKOes versus the likes of Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Mega Lopunny, while also strengthening Aqua Jet to better combat setup sweepers like Iron Boulder. Teammates like Raging Bolt and Tapu Lele appreciate Urshifu-R's ability to bring them in against bulky defensive walls like Corviknight, Alomomola, and Toxapex. Tapu Lele can also set strong Future Sight for Urshifu-R to abuse and break through Toxapex. However, it is recommended to not to use Aqua Jet when Urshifu-R is paired with Tapu Lele due to its Psychic Surge.

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Enamorus is a potent wallbreaker, utilizing its strong Moonblast alongside colorful coverage to punch severe holes into defensive cores. Earth Power and Mystical Fire complement its STAB Moonblast well, with the former hitting Toxapex, Clodsire, Gholdengo, and Heatran, while the latter OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Focus Blast grants Enamorus its strongest attack to hit Garganacl and Mega Tyranitar, which could otherwise survive Earth Power and Moonblast, respectively, while Psychic provides a safer middle ground option for Toxapex  Clodsire, and Mega Venusaur, which staves off its attacks otherwise. Tera Fairy grants Enamorus a power boost to Moonblast, notably allowing it to secure OHKOs against the likes of Landorus-T and Rotom-W, which would barely survive it otherwise. Enamorus fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its wallbreaking power while being able to support it adequately. Pivots such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T grant Enamorus free switch in opportunities against Great Tusk, opposing Landorus-T, and Rotom-W. The latter two pivots and Great Tusk, also provide entry hazard removal, which aids Enamorus given its Stealth Rock weakness. Enamorus works well with fast cleaners such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Scarf Kartana, as they appreciate Enamorus punching holes into the likes of Gholdengo and Mega Scizor for the latter two to clean up weakened defensive cores.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Enamorus serve as a solid wallbreaker, using forced switches from the likes of Great Tusk and Garchomp to set up. It is incredibly difficult to switch into after a boost given its strong Moonblast alongside coverage options in Earth Power and Mystical Fire to hit Fairy-resistant foes such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, respectively. Alternatively, Enamorus can forgo Mystical Fire for Substitute to take advantage of pivoting attempts as well as sponge attacks from revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Iron Valiant, although it makes it less effective at hitting Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. If using Substitute, Enamorus can opt for Leftovers instead of the standard Heavy-Duty Boots to potentially set up more Substitutes. Tera Ground boosts the power of Earth Power, allowing it to KO most Toxapex and Gholdengo sets after a boost, as well as giving it an immunity to Tapu Koko and Rotom-W's Electric-type attacks. Enamorus fits best on bulky offense and offense teams that appreciate its use as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker while granting it sufficient opportunities to enter the field. Therefore, pivots such as Mega Lopunny and Landorus-T pair well with it, bringing Enamorus in on physical walls it can exploit such as Great Tusk, Buzzwole, and Skarmory. Additionally, Pursuit trappers such as Mega Tyranitar and Weavile eliminate special walls such as Clodsire and Gholdengo that can serve as a roadblock to Enamorus. Fast late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Scarf Kartana appreciate Enamorus, as they capitalize on it weakening or removing Steel-types for them to clean up.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Enamorus functions as an interesting revenge killer, being able to KO a range of setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Mega Gyarados, Baxcalibur, and even a weakened Volcarona courtesy of its great speed tier. Additionally, it can serve as a late-game cleaner once its checks such as Toxapex, Gholdengo, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T have been weakened by its teammates. However, its Stealth Rock weakness and relative frailty mean Enamorus struggles to withstand repeated switches as well as priority moves from the likes of Urshifu-R and Mega Lopunny. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Moonblast, notably allowing it to 2HKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. Aside from coverage to hit Steel-types in Mystical Fire and Earth Power, Healing Wish can bring back a weakened teammate in a pinch, potentially being able to change the tide of a game. Therefore, Enamorus fits best on offense teams that appreciate its utility in Healing Wish while providing a positive matchup against opposing offensive teams. Powerful wallbreakers such as Baxcalibur and Volcarona appreciate Enamorus's Healing Wish, giving them a second lease on life, while Enamorus in turn capitalizes on them weakening the likes of Toxapex and Mega Scizor to clean late-game. Enamorus also greatly enjoys entry hazard removal support from Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, or Great Tusk, as it minimalizes its Stealth Rock weakness so it can switch in more effectively mid-game. Enamorus struggles with special wall such as Clodsire and Gholdengo, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Great Tusk make for good partners that can take advantage of them.</p>"

Triple Axel helps against Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T, and it can OHKO Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Toxic Spikes, when paired with Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T that pressure Toxic Spikes absorbers such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, can be hard to deal with and put setup sweepers like Iron Boulder on a timer. Spikes can be used to chip down foes like Ferrothorn and Toxapex after they have had their Heavy-Duty Boots removed. U-turn pivots out Meowscarda from its checks like Toxapex and Ferrothorn and brings in wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Zamazenta against them. Protective Pads protects Meowscarada from the abilities of Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and Rocky Helmet Pokemon like on Landorus-T, while Heavy-Duty Boots lets it avoid getting worn down by entry hazards. Tera Grass can help Meowscarada survive moves like Moonblast from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R, if Protean has changed its type. Entry hazard setters like Garganacl, Landorus-T, and Gliscor appreciate having Meowscarada as a teammate, as it can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex and Zapdos, making their hazards more potent. Meowscarada's mediocre defenses and weaknesses to Fighting-, Fire-, and Flying-type attacks mean it appreciates defensive teammates like Clefable, Alomomola, and Ferrothorn that resist or are neutral to those attacks. Meowscarada can pair well with other pivots like Landrous-T and Iron Crown, forming a VoltTurn core to help it deal with its checks like Toxapex. Meowscarada also pairs well with wallbreakers like Urshifu-R and Zamazenta, which can help break through checks like Ferrothorn.</p>"

Torch Song is a fantastic signature move that turns Skeledirge into a potent wincon. Torch Song also bypasses Substitute, punishing users of the move like Serperior, Kyurem, and Zamazenta. Will-O-Wisp lets Skeledirge hinder physical atackers like Zamazenta, Dragonite, and Mega Lopunny. Slack Off is required in order to take on the Pokemon it can check reliably. Hex is a strong STAB move that pairs well alongside Will-O-Wisp. Hex is also great when paired with Pokemon that have an easy time spreading status like Clefable and Toxapex, and it hits Gliscor for huge damage as well. Earth Power lets Skeledirge punish Heatran predicting a Torch Song or Will-O-Wisp while also hitting Gouging Fire, Mega Tyranitar, and Garganacl much harder. Specially defensive Skeledirge is a well-rounded tank, capable of taking on Volcarona, Iron Valiant lacking Shadow Ball, and Iron Crown. Physically defensive Skeledirge focuses purely on its physical walling capabilities, most notably against the likes of Zamazenta, Dragonite, physical variants of Iron Valiant, and Mega Lopunny. Tera Fairy provides an appreciated resistance to Dark and Immunity to Dragon, allowing specially defensive variants to handle the likes of Darkrai and Raging Bolt, while physically defensive variants are able to beat Mega Tyranitar and Weavile. Tera Water lets Skeledirge play more effectively against rain sweepers like Mega Swampert and Barraskewda and hinder them with Will-O-Wisp. It can also tackle Urshifu-R and Hisuian Samurott, all while having a great defensive typing in Water. Skeledirge is a good pick for certain balance and stall teams that appreciate its unique traits. Due to its vulnerability to Knock Off, Skeledirge really appreciates Pokemon that can absorb the move for it, so Pokemon like Gliscor, Clefable, and Mega Tyranitar are solid partners for it. Pokemon that resist Water like Toxapex and Alomomola are welcomed editions, and the latter appreciates Skeledirge's ability to handle Grass-types. Checks to Darkrai and Weavile like Mega Tyranitar and Zamazenta also help Skeledirge greatly, and in return, it's able to beat some of their answers, such as opposing Zamazenta and Clefable. Mega Lopunny in particular synergizes greatly with Skeledirge; it provides solid speed control and can switch into Knock Off, while Skeledirge provides a burn immunity and serves as a defensive backbone, which helps against the likes of Zamazenta and Mega Scizor that Mega Lopunny can otherwise struggle with.</p>"

Unfortunately, it is extremely reliant on Tera to be a consistent check to the aforementioned Pokemon due to its pure Rock typing being a liability defensively. Iron Defense allows Garganacl to outscale other physical setup sweepers like Dragonite, Gouging Fire, and Gliscor and beat them. Body Press turns into a powerful move after a few Iron Defenses, letting Garganacl be immediately threatening and pressuring opponents who try to stall out Salt Cure via dual Regenerator or Poison Heal Pokemon. Salt Cure is a mainstay on Garganacl, letting it make consistent progress against almost every Pokemon in the tier, especially pressuring Toxapex, which threatens to take away its boosts with Haze, and Dondonzo and Skeledirge, which ignore its boosted Body Press. Leftovers is crucial on Garganacl to prevent it from being worn down by chip damage and allow it to use its Recovers sparingly. Garganacl is extremely reliant on Terastallization, and every Tera option changes what it is able and unable to check. Tera Fairy is an all-around stellar Tera type defensively, giving Garganacl only two uncommon weaknesses and flipping the script on Fighting-types like Mega Medicham and Zamazenta. Tera Water allows Garganacl to perform exceptionally against rain, walling Barraskewda, Mega Swampert, and Urshifu-R while still being an overall solid defensive Tera type. Tera Dragon lets Garganacl keep the Water and Fire resistances that Tera Water provides while also making it resist Grass, letting it wall Ogerpon-W. However, being weak to Fairy means Garganacl can be easily forced out by Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Iron Defense Garganacl fits best on bulkier teams that appreciate its unique defensive profile and the potential for it to be a wincon. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Gliscor is crucial for putting more pressure on the Pokemon that try to dance around Garganacl's Salt Cure. In order to not be too reliant on Tera, additional defensive pieces surrounding Garganacl are important, making options like Toxapex and Mega Latias great partners. These teammates also deal with the Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon that pressure Garganacl. Lastly, Leftovers is important for Garganacl to function as a setup sweeper, so Knock Off absorbers like the aforementioned Toxapex and Mega Scizor are needed. Partners like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Urshifu-R that appreciate Garganacl pressuring Steel-, Flying-, and Water-types like Ferrothorn and Toxapex also work well with it.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Garganacl is a practical Stealth Rock setter due to its high bulk, amazing ability, and access to Salt Cure. Garganacl can safely set up Stealth Rock against common pivots like Ferrothorn, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking. Common Defog users like Zapdos, Corviknight, and Moltres can barely threaten Garganacl and take dangerous passive damage from Salt Cure. Other entry hazard removal Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk also dislike Salt Cure as they rely on Leftovers for passive recovery. Protect is crucial for Garganacl for passive recovery from Leftovers and to exacerbate chip damage from Salt Cure. It can also help to scout moves from Choice item users like Tapu Lele and Rillaboom, as well as stalling weather turns against rain and sun teams. However, it is important not to rely on Protect too much to the point where Garganacl can be exploited by opponents. Garganacl has a variety of good Tera types; Tera Water turns the tables versus Pokemon like Urshifu-Rapid-Strike and Mega Scizor and performs better against rain and sun, but leaves it vulernable to opposing Garganacl and Electric-types like Raging Bolt and Tapu Koko. Tera Dragon has most of the advantages of Tera Water in addition to checking Ogerpon-W and Mega Charizard Y, but it makes Garganacl weak to Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele. Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost both help Garganacl to check Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Mega Lopunny. Teammates like Ogerpon-W and Mega Lopunny appreciate Garganacl's ability to threaten Water- and Flying-types. Garganacl also benefits from them dealing with offensive targets like Tapu Lele and opposing Ogerpon-W. Garganacl's main way to gain momentum is via Salt Cure, so foes with Abilities like Regenerator and Poison Heal can nullify its chip damage. It is therefore very helpful to have teammates like Weavile, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko to spam Knock Off or threaten common Regenerator pivots.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<p>Curse Garganacl is a solid wincon that can turn games around in the blink of an eye. Curse in conjunction with Terastallization lets it take hits from common physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T, and its ability prevents it from getting Toxic poisoned, a major roadblock to slow setup sweepers. Salt Cure allows Garganacl to chip foes and is complemented by Attack boosts from Curse; it also discourages common threats to Garganacl like Iron Crown and Urshifu-R from switching in directly. Earthquake hits almost all foes for decent damage with enough boosts, threatening Steel- and Electric-types like Iron Crown, Raging Bolt, Galarian Slowking, and Tapu Koko for particularly high damage; Salt Cure covers Flying-types that Earthquake cannot reach. Heavy Slam deals immediate damage to Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Clefable, which threaten to deal massive damage with their STAB moves or are immune to Salt Cure's passive damage in the latter's case. Tera Water allows Garganacl to beat common Water-types like Manaphy, Urshifu-R, and Mega Swampert, giving its team a positive matchup against rain teams. Tera Fairy allows Garganacl to resist Fighting-type moves from Urshifu-R, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny, especially when unboosted, as Garganacl gets several free turns to set up after surprising these foes. Garganacl is a fat momentum sapper that lends itself well to balance teams, as they are able to compensate for its lack of immediate power with their ability to withstand heavy damage; Alomomola, a commonly seen Pokemon on these archetypes, is a great ally that can heal up Garganacl, allowing it to be used more recklessly with Salt Cure to offset the passivity of other allies. Garganacl is extremely hampered by Taunt and Knock Off users, as they prevent it from setting up and healing and prevent Leftovers passive recovery. It is best to wait for such foes to be eliminated before trying to set up. Therefore, Knock Off absorbers like Mega Scizor and Gliscor are good teammates to threaten Knock Off users including Hisuian Samurott and Ferrothorn. Garganacl performs best when used with Terastallization, as its base typing gives it nasty weaknesses to common foes like Zamazenta and Landorus-T; thus, allies should try not to expend Terastallization early-game. This means that a solid defensive core, such as Alomomola and Heatran, should be used to help with the longevity of the team and can chip down foes until it is safe to set up.</p>"

Close Combat is a good coverage option, letting Ceruledge dent bulky Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar; alternatively, Shadow Sneak offers a form of priority that can pick off unsuspecting revenge killers like Iron Boulder. Focus Sash allows Ceruledge to usually guarantee an oppotunity to set up one Swords Dance, while Ghostium Z turns Poltergeist into a nuke that can eviscerate even the bulkiest of Pokemon, OHKOing even Alomomola and Toxapex at +2. Tera Ghost allows Poltergeist to be boosted to ludicrous power levels without having to invest in Ghostium Z, letting Ceruledge OHKO offensive Great Tusk and Gliscor after a boost. Bulky Dark-types, like the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar, can force Ceruledge out - therefore, Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Zamazenta as well as Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant are great partners for it. In return, all of them appreciate Ceruledge being able to threaten bulky Pokemon that might try to take their attacks, such as Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, Toxapex, and Heatran. Revenge killers like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Samurott-H also limit Ceruledge's ability to impact the game beyond potentially grabbing one KO, so teammates that can deal with them, such as Mega Scizor and Dragonite, are highly appreciated. Water-types like the aforementioned Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W are also effective teammates for Ceruledge, as they can come in on Water-type attacks from opposing Urshifu-R and Samurott-H while being able to rely on Ceruledge to break through troublesome Grass-types like Ferrothorn.</p>"

Curse turns Dondozo into an intimidating win condition in the later stages of the game, able to set up on the likes of Mega Mawile and Gouging Fire, while Body Press allows Dondozo to hit Water-resistant foes like Ferrothorn and Ogerpon-W. Tera Dragon flips the matchup on Pokemon which would normally threaten it, such as Kartana, Rillaboom, and especially Ogerpon-W. Due to its passive nature, Dondozo is found mainly on bulky teams, partnering well with Pokemon like Gliscor and Ting-Lu, which can handle Dondozo checks like Toxapex, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias, while Dondozo can check the Water-types that would threaten them, like Urshifu-R or Hisuian Samurott. Dondozo usually carries Heavy-Duty Boots as its item to ensure it can switch in safely when it is used on teams with less reliable entry hazard removal, though if paired with a reliable hazard remover like Tornadus-T, Dondozo can opt for Leftovers to shore up its poor recovery, allowing it to 1v1 threats such as Mega Scizor and Zamazenta more reliably.</p>"

Spikes are preferred on Clodsire, as the move has more limited distribution and Clodsire enters the field commonly enough to have the opportunity to use the move. However, Stealth Rock can be used if Clodsire's team requires it. Toxic is used to cripple common switch-ins to Clodsire, such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Great Tusk. Poison Jab can be used to poison post-Tera Gholdengo attempting to remove its Ground weakness, and it forces damage on Tornadus-T faster. Heavy-Duty Boots are preferred on Clodsire to negate its weakness to opposing Spikes teams, although Leftovers are also viable to increase Clodsire's longevity. Unaware is preferred over Water Absorb to negate Clodsire's passivity against setup sweepers, and Water Absorb does little to help against the likes of Mega Swampert and Gastrodon. Tera Dark grants Clodsire a Ghost resistance, which helps against Choice Specs Dragapult and Gholdengo, especially if using Poison Jab against the latter.

As Clodsire is weak to most physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Dragonite, teammates that can cover them, such as Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Buzzwole, make for good partners. In return, Clodsire can switch into Electric-type attacks for the former, and powerful special attackers such as Dragapult for the latter two.

In return, Clodsire appreciates these teammates being able to make more immediate progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Tornadus-T as well as Weavile and Mega Scizor pair well with Clodsire, crippling Heavy-Duty Boots users such as opposing Clodsire and Toxapex, giving Clodsire's entry hazards support a greater impact.</p>"

First Impression clears Pokemon such as Kartana while also denting Bug-resistant Pokemon such as Dragapult and Mega Lopunny. U-turn lets Slither Wing obtain momentum while also chipping switch-ins like Tornadus-T and Landorus-T. Flare Blitz tears through Gholdengo and is Slither Wing's strongest attack against Landorus-T and Gliscor, while Earthquake hits Pokemon like Toxapex and Skeledirge while still threatening Gholdengo as well. Tera Bug bolsters First Impression's power to high levels, maximizing Slither Wing's revenge killing potential and enabling it to spread much more chip damage with U-turn; however, it gains a Stealth Rock weakness. Slither Wing pairs well with Mega Charizard Y, as it enables Protosynthesis, which lets Slither Wing threaten the opposition more often. It also boosts Flare Blitz, letting it dent Landorus-T and Gliscor better. In return, Mega Charizard Y threatens Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Gholdengo. Special wallbreakers that wear down Slither Wing checks such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko pair well with it; they also benefit from Slither Wing breaking their checks. Slither Wing lures in Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite, so Pokemon such as Weavile and Tapu Koko pair well with it, both notably forcing Dragonite to Terastallize into the Normal-type and making it prone to First Impression.</p>"

Due to its amazing bulk, Iron Hands is able to setup Swords Dance reliably to punch holes through foes more easily. Ice Punch allows Iron Hands to hit Gliscor, Landorus-T and Garchomp super effectively, complementing its STAB moves nicely. Iron Hands can use Tera Water to take otherwise super effective hits from the likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Great Tusk, alongside gaining a resistance to Water-type moves, allowing Iron Hands to answer common rain abusers including Mega Swampert and Barraskewda, while Tera Flying makes Iron Hands immune to Ground-type moves from the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp. The given EV spread allows Iron Hands to survive an unboosted Tapu Lele Psychic from full HP, while the Speed investment lets Iron Hands outspeed Clefable. Because of Iron Hands's poor Speed but fantastic bulk, it's more suited to bulky offense and balance teams as opposed to hyper offensive team structures. Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor and Tornadus-T are fantastic teammates because they can switch into the strong Ground-type moves that threaten Iron Hands such as Great Tusk's Headlong Rush; in addition, they can all remove entry hazards, which is appreciated by Tera Flying variants, and the former two are also able to set hazards, helping Iron Hands break through teams more easily. Rillaboom can setup Grassy Terrain, weakening opposing Earthquake and giving Iron Hands more passive recovery alongside Leftovers while weakening the defensive Ground-types that could stop Iron Hands, although it should be noted Tera Flying variants will not benefit from the terrain. Defensive Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Iron Crown are good teammates because they can come in on the Psychic- and Fairy- types that Iron Hands dislikes, such as Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and Mega Latios. Alomomola boosts Iron Hands's longevity with Wish while being a good answer to Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Garchomp. Strong special attackers such as Mega Diancie, Serperior, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona appreciate Iron Hands breaking through common special walls like Galarian Slowking, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor, and in return they break through physically defensive walls like Landorus-T and Dondozo. Thunder Wave users such as Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn slow down foes such as Corviknight and Skarmory for Iron Hands to outspeed afterwards, so that it can hit them with boosted attacks before they can setup against it with Iron Defense.</p>"

Tapu Koko in particular is an astounding partner, as it enables Quark Drive for Iron Jugulis, which lets it outspeed Pokemon like Dragapult and Mega Lopunny. Slowbro also provides Future Sight to pressure Toxapex and Clodsire. Pokemon that can wear down checks to Iron Jugulis such as Assault Vest Tornadus-T and Ting-Lu with entry hazards like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran are appreciated.

The potential Special Attack boost from Fiery Dance makes scouting the set of Iron Moth extremely dangerous. Energy Ball is for Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Water-types like Alomomola, Dondozo, and Urshifu-R. Dazzling Gleam threatens foes like Zamazenta and Garchomp with an OHKO at +1. Tera Blast with Tera Ground allows Iron Moth to OHKO Heatran, 2HKO Galarian Slowking or OHKO it at +1 with minor chip damage, and 2HKO Garganacl, meanwhile providing Iron Moth with a valuable immunity to Thunder Wave from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Ferrothorn. Tera Grass, on the other hand, gives Energy Ball a STAB boost, which can guarantee it OHKOes foes like Mega Diancie and Urshifu-R without a Fiery Dance boost. It also flips Iron Moth's weakness to Water- and Ground-types, easing the matchup versus Ogerpon-W and Garchomp. The Special Attack and Speed EVs give Iron Moth a Speed boost with Quark Drive, and the remainder goes to Defense instead of HP in order to better take priority moves like Fake Out from Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham, Extreme Speed from Dragonite, Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile, and Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R after Terastallizing. Iron Moth appreciates teammates like Ogerpon-W and Landorus-T to pressure its common checks like Heatran and Galarian Slowking when not running Tera Ground. Additionally, Ogerpon-W can break Multiscale on Dragonite to give Iron Moth an easier clean. Landorus-T and Great Tusk can provide entry hazard control with Defog and Rapid Spin respectively to cover Iron Moth's weakness to Stealth Rock. Tapu Lele is also a great partner of Iron Moth since its Psychic Surge can protect Iron Moth from revenge killers like Mega Mawile, and the two of them can wear down their common checks like Galarian Slowking and Heatran for each other.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With decent offensive stats, unique typing and wide movepool, Heavy-Duty Boots Iron Moth is a great offensive threat that is capable of checking popular threats such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Mega Scizor and keeps momentum up if needed. Fiery Dance is favored over other Fire-type moves because with its boost, Iron Moth is able to break through lesser sturdy checks like Gliscor. Energy Ball paired with Tera Grass is usually the first choice to reverse its matchup against Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon such as Alomomola, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. Dazzling Gleam boosted by Tera Fairy allows it to blow up Zamazenta, Dragon-type Pokemon like Garchomp and Raging Bolt that it otherwise struggles against. Tera Blast combined with Tera Ground lets it OHKO its biggest predator, Heatran, as well as hit popular special walls like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex for super effective damage. All three coverage moves also help Iron Moth beat Mega Tyranitar after it switches into entry hazards multiple times. The last slot is usually reserved for utility. U-turn takes advantage of Iron Moth's ability to lure in checks such as Galarian Slowking and Clodsire and pivots wallbreaker teammates like Mega Tyranitar and Mega Medicham in, aiding a more offensive playstyle; Morning Sun boosts Iron Moth's longevity, enabling it to stay healthy and check opposing Mega Scizor and Iron Valiant throughout the game. Because of its mediocre Base Power moves, Iron Moth often struggles with bulky walls; therefore, it appreciates hazard support from teammates like Gliscor, Hisuian Samurott, and Ferrothorn to chip at checks such as Heatran and Garganacl, while powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile improve its matchup against sturdy walls that ignore hazard chip damage like Galarian Slowking, Toxapex, and Blissey. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile especially help in chipping and even eliminating those walls with Pursuit support, which often relieves the urgency for Iron Moth to use Tera as well. In return, Iron Moth can pressure and threaten physical walls like Slowbro and Great Tusk that its teammates have trouble with. Iron Moth also appreciates slow pivots that can bring it safely onto the field, such as Galarian Slowking and Alomomola.</p>"

It notably performs well against strong offensive threats like Raging Bolt and Darkrai. Ruination deals noteworthy to damage Pokemon that would otherwise exploit Ting-Lu consistently like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Zamazenta. Spikes can be used over Stealth Rock to pressure grounded Pokemon that threaten Ting-Lu like the aforementioned Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Whirlwind is essential to check and phaze setup sweepers like Volcarona, Tornadus-T, and Gouging Fire while complementing Ting-Lu's tendency to stack entry hazards, letting it chip other foes on the opposing side throughout a game. Alternative options on Ting-Lu such as Stone Edge are usable over Ruination to threaten foes like Mega Charizard Y, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona. Tera Ghost lets Ting-Lu check Fighting-type Pokemon it would otherwise have problems facing, like Zamazenta and Great Tusk, notably spinblocking the latter, though it leaves Ting-Lu Pursuit weak against the likes of Mega Tyranitar. Tera Poison gives Ting-Lu a Toxic immunity and lets it wall Iron Valiant and Serperior. 8 Defense EVs let Ting-Lu survive Tera Normal Facade from Ursaluna at maximum HP. Offensive Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W and Iron Valiant appreciate Ting-Lu providing entry hazards to weaken checks to them like Ferrothorn and Iron Crown; it also checks Raging Bolt for Ogerpon-W and Galarian Slowking for Iron Valiant. Bulky Pokemon like Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Alomomola appreciate Ting-Lu checking Pokemon like Mega Latios, Zapdos, and Iron Crown for them. In return, they deal with threats that Ting-Lu would not be able to fend off, such as Weavile and Urshifu-R. Alomomola is a notable partner, as it checks the aforementioned and provides Ting-Lu HP via wishpassing. Hazard removal options such as Corviknight and Tornadus-T support Ting-Lu by providing hazard removal along with sponging Knock Off from Pokemon like Weavile and Ferrothorn, respectively, helping Ting-Lu have as much longevity as possible.</p>"

Furthermore, its great natural Speed stat allows it to force out numerous threats in the tier such as Mega Medicham and Urshifu-R. Thunderbolt nails Toxapex, while also hitting Corviknight and Volcarona without risking a miss. Shadow Ball lets Iron Valiant pressure Galarian Slowking, while being generally risk-free due to its lack of sturdy resists. Trick is an option to cripple passive checks like Toxapex and Clodsire, heavily impeding their ability to act as an effective defensive piece. Tera Fairy boosts Iron Valiant’s Moonblast to impressive levels, denting even sturdy resists like Mega Scizor hard, while Tera Ghost makes Shadow Ball as spammable as its STAB moves and is extremely effective due to the lack of common Pokemon resistant or immune to Ghost; however, this does make it prone to being Pursuit trapped by Weavile and Mega Tyranitar. Iron Valiant appreciates pivoting support from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko to constantly bring it in on foes like opposing Landorus-T and Raging Bolt. Tapu Koko’s Electric Surge also activates Quark Drive, making it significantly harder to revenge kill Iron Valiant with otherwise dangerous revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Choice Scarf Kartana. Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Galarian Slowking are also good partners, as they can remove or pressure Iron Valiant’s biggest checks in opposing Galarian Slowking and Toxapex. Entry hazard support from Ferrothorn, Hisuian Samurott, and Garchomp is also important, as they can wear down Iron Valiant’s less sturdy checks such as Heatran, opposing Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor very quickly. Lastly, offensive teammates like Ogerpon-W, Mega Latios, and Raging Bolt work really well with Iron Valiant as they can easily overload their shared checks like Ferrothorn, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran together.</p>"

Its high Speed combined with Booster Energy allows it to outspeed +1 setup sweepers like Mega Gyarados, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona, as well as naturally fast targets like Mega Lopunny and Darkrai. The popularity of specially offensive Iron Valiant can allow this set to catch opponents off guard and give it a free opportunity to use Swords Dance against foes like Galarian Slowking. Swords Dance boosts Iron Valiant's power to dangerous levels, enabling it to OHKO foes neutral to Fighting like Corviknight and Alomomola with a favorable roll or minor chip damage. Knock Off provides valuable coverage for Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown, and it can also take down walls like Ferrothorn and Garganacl after they use Tera Ghost. Encore can lock physically defensive walls like Alomomola and Landorus-T into recovery moves or status moves like Defog, which can give Iron Valiant a good chance to set up. Ice Punch is an alternative to Encore for Landorus-T and Dragonite. Tera Dark gives Knock Off a STAB boost, allowing it to do more damage to foes like Galarian Slowking and Zapdos. Tera Steel, on the other hand, provides Iron Valiant with resistances to common priority moves like Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor, Ice Shard from Weavile, and Extreme Speed from Dragonite, which can prevent it from being revenge killed. Tera Steel can also be paired with Encore to take advantage of Sludge Bomb from Galarian Slowking and Toxic from foes like Alomomola. Iron Valiant pairs well with teammates like Iron Boulder, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt, since they can pressure common checks for it, such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Dondozo. Iron Valiant is very fragile to priority moves due to its low bulk and the side effects of Close Combat, so Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge can protect it from priority moves and allow it to safely sweep. In addition, Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant can take care of each other's checks. Iron Valiant can break Galarian Slowking and Heatran, while Tapu Lele gives physical walls like Dondozo a hard time. Iron Valiant also appreciates other Knock Off users on its team to help wear down Unaware users like Dondozo and Skeledirge by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers.</p>"

Moonblast is its most spammable STAB move, since most Steel-types are threatened by Focus Blast, leaving Galarian Slowking as one of its few reliable checks. Thunderbolt provides valuable coverage against Water-types like Alomomola and Toxapex, while Shadow Ball hits Galarian Slowking super effectively. Focus Blast is Iron Valiant's strongest STAB move, OHKOing common Steel-type walls at +1 such as Mega Scizor after a decent amount of chip damage, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Encore prevents sweeps from setup Pokemon like Volcarona and lets Iron Valiant set up against Pokemon like Alomomola and Toxapex. Tera Electric makes Iron Valiant immune to paralysis from walls like Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking while allowing Thunderbolt to OHKO Alomomola and specially defensive Toxapex after minimal chip at +1. Tera Ghost grants Iron Valiant a resistance to Poison-type moves and gives Shadow Ball a STAB boost, allowing it to better take advantage of its coverage and 2HKO Galarian Slowking with minimal chip or at +1. Tera Steel is a good defensive type that helps Iron Valiant set up on the likes of Alomomola and Choice-locked Tapu Lele and provides a resistance to priority moves such as Bullet Punch, Ice Shard, and Extreme Speed. It can also be paired with Encore to turn Galarian Slowking into setup fodder by locking it into Sludge Bomb. Iron Valiant appreciates teammates like Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Mega Scizor that overwhelm common special walls in Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Blissey, letting it sweep. Knock Off support from the likes of Mega Scizor and Tyranitar is also appreciated, as removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Toxapex and Leftovers from Heatran and Ferrothorn can help position Iron Valiant to sweep.</p>"

Close Combat is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move over Aura Sphere or Focus Blast because it can do more damage to foes like Heatran and Iron Boulder while maintaining strength and accuracy. Knock Off is an excellent way of making progress, as it can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers on common walls like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Landorus-T, and it can provide valuable coverage for Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown. Trick is fantastic against more passive teams and can cripple switch-ins like Toxapex and Alomomola. It can also lock setup sweepers like Volcarona into one move, making them much easier to deal with. Destiny Bond, on the other hand, can be used as an emergency plan to trade with foes like Ogerpon-W and Gouging Fire, especially after they acquire several boosts. Tera Fairy can increase the power of Moonblast, guaranteeing a 2HKO against utility Tornadus-T and Zapdos and an OHKO against Zamazenta. Teammates like Hisuian Samurott and Ogerpon-W pair well with Iron Valiant, since they can pressure foes like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola. In addition, Hisuian Samurott can also stack Spikes via Ceaseless Edge, which greatly helps Iron Valiant with its lack of power, as it can often remove Heavy-Duty Boots from key targets such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking with Knock Off or Trick. Iron Valiant appreciates teammates like Mega Scizor and Zapdos to help it deal with Iron Boulder and Hawlucha, which are capable of outspeeding it.</p>"

Ogerpon’s unique Speed boost upon Terastallizing and ability to hold an item give it more potential to clean through a weakened team while outrunning common revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Kartana. However, Ogerpon faces stiff competition from other offensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana, as well as the other Ogerpon formes that possess a beneficial dual typing and an automatic 1.2x boost to their attacks. Superpower allows Ogerpon to wreak havoc on defensive cores using Ferrothorn and Heatran as Grass-type switch-ins, scoring a clean OHKO on Heatran and heavily denting physically defensive Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance. Meadow Plate is the item of choice, OHKOing Gliscor after Swords Dance with Stealth Rock chip, as well as potentially OHKOing Toxapex after Tera Grass and Swords Dance. Knock Off is Ogerpon's strongest option to hit Tornadus-T, Moltres, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking. Additionally, Defiant leverages Landorus-T's Intimidate against it; however, its poor matchup versus Defog users such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight render it unable to effectively switch in on Defog attempts and activate Defiant. Teammates that match up effectively into these aforementioned Defog users, such as Ting Lu, Mega Tyranitar, and Gliscor, serve as quality teammates, with Mega Tyranitar in particular being able to chip these foes into range of Ogerpon's attacks.

Swords Dance amps up Ogerpon-W's power to dangerous levels, most notably OHKOing standard Ferrothorn with Superpower and 2HKOing defensive Zapdos and Toxapex with Ivy Cudgel and Power Whip, respectively. Power Whip is a more threatening STAB option thanks to its high Base Power, but Horn Leech lets Ogerpon-W offset any Toxic damage from Toxapex and Alomomola, letting it set up on the pair. Superpower hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Archaludon, OHKOing them at +2. Alternatively, Encore lets Ogerpon-W gain setup opportunities against passive foes like Ferrothorn and Toxapex using status moves. With Tera Water, Ogerpon-W not only gets a huge boost to Ivy Cudgel's power, but also gains a Special Defense boost, which can help stave off revenge killing attempts from threats like Tornadus-T and Iron Valiant. Ogerpon-W can struggle with Grass-types like Kartana and Ferrothorn, especially if lacking Superpower, so teammates like Heatran and Tornadus-T are greatly appreciated. Heatran also sets Stealth Rock to help Ogerpon-W defeat its answers that lack recovery, like Raging Bolt and Archaludon if Ogerpon-W lacks Superpower, over a longer period of time if it cannot brute-force its way through them. Tornadus-T, meanwhile, can remove entry hazards to improve Ogerpon-W's longevity as well as remove crucial items like Leftovers from defensive stops like Toxapex and Raging Bolt. Its Nasty Plot set also appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to take advantage of specially defensive walls like Ting-Lu and Chansey. Offensive teammates like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar can deal with Dragon-types like the aforementioned Raging Bolt and Dragonite; Weavile and Mega Tyranitar in particular can Pursuit trap said Dragon-types, opening Ogerpon-W up to sweeping. Despite having a good Speed tier, Ogerpon-W is vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats like Iron Boulder and Mega Lopunny; as such, teammates that can switch into these threats, like Landorus-T and Gliscor, are highly appreciated.

However, Ogerpon-C should be mindful about using its Tera, as this removes its Sturdy for an arguably worse +1 Defense. Power Whip is used for its higher Base Power, which reduces Ogerpon-C's reliance on Swords Dance for immediate power, while Horn Leech trades damage for healing and reliability. Superpower allows Ogerpon-C to hit Ferrothorn, although this breaks Sturdy, along with Tera Steel foes like Iron Valiant. Ogerpon-C's main weakness lies in its reliance on Sturdy to set up against more powerful foes and its lack of immediate power before setting up. Thus, it is better off being saved as a cleaner for the later stages of a game. Entry hazard support, in particular Spikes, is highly valued to allow Ogerpon-C to KO many more threats; it can capitalize on hazard chip, for instance KOing even bulky foes like defensive Great Tusk unboosted once they are chipped. Thus, allies that can set hazards early-game like Hisuian Samurott and Garchomp are good partners. Ogerpon-C is also held back by its middling Speed tier, which leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by Mega Lopunny, as it is capable of bypassing Sturdy, along with many other foes like Iron Valiant if Ogerpon-C has already lost Sturdy.

      "Rain Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great typing, good bulk, and signature move Electro Shot, Archaludon is born to be an excellent wallbreaker on rain teams. The dual STAB moves and Electro Shot are must-haves for Archaludon as a rain wallbreaker; the last slot, however, is a bit flexible. Body Press and Aura Sphere both complement Archaludon's coverage to break through Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. The former receives a boost from Stamina and deals with Heatran and Ting-Lu better, while the latter is more consistent with Electro Shot boosts in rain and avoids chip damage from Iron Barbs. Stealth Rock can be used as an alternative choice on non-Assault Vest sets to allow teammates like Mega Swampert to run coverage moves like Ice Punch and Ferrothorn to run Spikes. Archaludon can threaten premier entry hazard removers such as Tornadus-T and Landorus-T, ensuring Stealth Rock stays up. Depending on the pacing of the team, different items and EV spreads are available for Archaludon. Leftovers is used to increase its longevity, which helps long-term. Eject Pack can be favored to keep the momentum up by preventing Archaludon from being stuck on the field against pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Assault Vest Iron Crown after its Special Attack is lowered by Draco Meteor. Assault Vest makes up for Archaludon's weak Special Defense and often lets it trade with one or more offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Iron Moth. To pair with Assault Vest, a bulky spread of 248 HP EVs is used, while 56 Speed EVs still allow Archaludon to outspeed Landorus-T. Tera Flying provides an immunity to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp and a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Zamazenta. Tera Fairy also grants a resistance to Fighting-type moves and is a better defensive type overall due to only having a few weaknesses as well as not being weak to Stealth Rock. Pelipper is a necessary teammate, as its Drizzle enables Archaludon to take advantage of Electro Shot. Other Water-type wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert and Ogerpon-W are also appreciated for their ability to break through bulky Ground-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Gliscor. In return, those Water-type wallbreakers appreciate Archaludon's ability to beat opposing Ogerpon-W.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gouging Fire is a devastating wallbreaker and setup sweeper alike that can tear through teams easily. Earthquake allows Gouging Fire to break past Toxapex and Heatran, which would otherwise be able to wall it. Morning Sun gives Gouging Fire the ability to heal off any chip damage from priority or Rocky Helmet, making it even more difficult to take down for defensive teams. Outrage can be used as a nuke with Dragonium Z, letting Gouging Fire muscle past walls such as Dondozo through its sheer strength alone. Tera Ground can be used to power up Gouging Fire's Earthquake while allowing it to remove its weaknesses to revenge killers such as Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Great Tusk, allowing it to potentially win on the spot. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Gouging Fire to come in many times and attempt to set up, while Booster Energy gives Gouging Fire a one-time Attack boost that can be crucial in breaking past foes such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T while still allowing Gouging Fire to Terastallize. Teammates that struggle with Steel-types, like Tapu Lele and Pecharunt, appreciate Gouging Fire breaking through those Steel-types. In return, they dispatch the physical walls that trouble Gouging Fire, such as Dondozo. Gouging Fire is often prone to getting revenge killed by Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, so teammates that can deal with the aforementioned threats, like Mega Scizor and Landorus-T, are appreciated.</p>"

Flare Blitz is reliable STAB into Pokemon like Zamazenta and Great Tusk; however, Heat Crash can be used for its lack of recoil, though its variable Base Power makes it harder to break through the aforementioned Pokemon. Earthquake lets Gouging Fire hit Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Toxapex. Morning Sun provides reliable recovery, letting Gouging Fire maintain a sweep, check Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and Iron Valiant long term, and offset Flare Blitz recoil. The given EV spread lets Gouging Fire take Scorching Sands twice at full HP from Mega Charizard Y and outspeed Tornadus-T at +1. Tera Steel turns would-be checks to Gouging Fire like Alomomola and Raging Bolt into setup fodder while also providing a Toxic immunity. Teammates like Ogerpon-W and Tapu Lele that struggle against Steel-types like Kartana and Mega Scizor appreciate Gouging Fire checking and setting up on them. Gouging Fire also provides a good matchup into sun teams, which offensive teammates like Mega Lopunny and Kartana appreciate as well. In return, the latter threatens Water-types like Alomomola and other Pokemon that check Gouging Fire like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Gouging Fire is a potent wallbreaker and cleaner commonly found on sun teams. Under sun, Tera Fire makes Heat Crash a very powerful and spammable move. Flare Blitz allows Gouging Fire to hit heavier Pokemon that Gouging Fire can't hit as hard with Heat Crash, like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Raging Fury is an alternative option to this, as it is not a contact move and does not deal recoil damage. 168 Attack EVs and a Jolly Nature allow it to gain a Speed boost under sun with Protosynthesis. Even with this combination, Gouging Fire is still stopped by heavier foes that are also very physically bulky, such as Garganacl, Great Tusk and Dondozo. Choice Band Gouging Fire is also very prone to entry hazard chip, as it does not hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Because of these reasons, Gouging Fire largely appreciates hazard removal options like Great Tusk and Iron Treads that also synergize well with sun setters, which are Torkoal and Mega Charizard Y. Great Tusk is great under sun as it can be a good wallbreaking partner with an Attack Protosynthesis boost. Great Tusk is also able to help wallbreak against some other Fire-resistant foes, such as Garganacl, chipped Alomomola, and opposing Great Tusk. Iron Treads , on the other hand, has Volt Switch to bring Gouging Fire in safely. Gouging Fire also greatly appreciates Pokemon that can threaten Alomomola and Dondozo on their weaker Special Defense side, like Raging Bolt and Mega Charizard Y. Raging Bolt can threaten Gouging Fire's common switch-ins like Dondozo and Alomomola with powerful Special attacks and super effective STAB moves and also use Volt Switch to bring Gouging Fire in very easily. Gouging Fire also supports Raging Bolt by threatening the Ground-types and Electric-resistant foes that can switch into it, such as Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T. Mega Charizard Y is one of Gouging Fire's best partners, as it sets up sun with Drought, allowing Gouging Fire to boost its Speed with Protosynthesis, and can also break holes into opposing teams with Solar Beam and powerful Fire-type moves.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With access to Calm Mind and a stellar base 137 Special Attack, Raging Bolt is able to act as an excellent bulky setup sweeper. Raging Bolt’s good typing allows it to break through defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Toxapex, and Rotom-W while also checking threats like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Kartana. Thunderclap offsets Raging Bolt’s subpar Speed stat, allowing it to revenge kill offensive threats such as Urshifu-R, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny as well as weakened setup sweepers like Iron Boulder, Volcarona, and Swords Dance Kartana, while Thunderbolt gives Raging Bolt a consistent damaging attack that doesn’t rely on prediction like Thunderclap and has significantly higher PP, allowing Raging Bolt to use its Electric-type moves in longer games. Substitute is an alternative to nullify passive Pokémon that can’t touch Raging Bolt such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos and give it more opportunities to set up, while Taunt can be used to deny setup from Garganacl and Mega Scizor but at the cost of a worse matchup against Galarian Slowking. Draco Meteor in tandem with Dragonium Z lets it break through Electric-immune Pokemon such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu as well as other specially bulky Pokémon that can take on Raging Bolt such as Mega Tyranitar and Galarian Slowking. Alternatively, Leftovers is also an option on Substitute sets to passively heal the chip taken from Substitute and give Raging Bolt some form of recovery. Tera Flying grants Raging Bolt a Ground immunity while giving a Fighting resistance that helps against Great Tusk and Zamazenta while also avoiding any Ground-type coverage from Serperior. Tera Fairy gives this same Fighting resistance while giving Raging Bolt an immunity to Dragon-type moves from the likes of Garchomp and Gouging Fire. The given EV spread allows Raging Bolt to live a +2 Superpower from Ogerpon-W after Stealth Rock, as well as outspeeding uninvested Landorus-T. Raging Bolt struggles against fast Ground- and Fairy-types like Garchomp, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Great Tusk, Tapu Koko, Iron Valiant, and especially Tapu Lele; Tapu Lele in particular can give Raging Bolt some trouble as well, as its Psychic Surge renders Thunderclap useless. Teammates like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Galarian Slowking help beat these checks. Since Raging Bolt has no reliable recovery, Alomomola is a good partner to pass huge HP wishes to it and pivot it in. Other pivots like Tornadus-T, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T also help bring Raging Bolt in safely. Teammates like Great Tusk and Zamazenta appreciate Raging Bolt taking care of Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos as well as bulky Waters like Rotom-W and Alomomola. In return, they help check Ferrothorn and Weavile. Great Tusk is another good partner, because it helps remove entry hazards, which harm Raging Bolt greatly, particularly Spikes.</p>"

It has access to a strong STAB move in Mighty Cleave that bypasses Protect, which can be useful against a weakened Gliscor. Close Combat has great coverage alongside Mighty Cleave and hits Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Garganacl, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Tyranitar for massive damage, being able to OHKO all of them at +2 Attack with Tera Fighting. Zen Headbutt hits Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Urshifu-R. Substitute allows Iron Boulder to scout for switches, as well as become immune to certain status moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp. Iron Boulder can use Tera Flying to become immune to Earthquake that would otherwise OHKO it from Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. If your team has Tapu Koko to provide Electric Terrain, one option is to use Rockium Z over Booster Energy to power up Mighty Cleave to insane levels, OHKOing Gliscor and all but the bulkiest Landorus-T with Stealth Rock support after a Swords Dance. However, this option does make Iron Boulder dependent on Electric Terrain to retain its boosted Speed. Tapu Koko can also set up Reflect and Light Screen to help facilitate a sweep. Iron Boulder fits best on highly offensive teams, and functions as a late-game cleaner as well as a emergency check to speedy threats including Dragon Dance users like Gouging Fire and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Fighting-types like Great Tusk, Mega Lopunny, and Urshifu-R benefit from having Iron Boulder on the team, as Iron Boulder can take advantage of and switch into Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T that such allies are weak to. Teammates such as Hawlucha, Kartana and Iron Valiant can appreciate Rockium Z Iron Boulder's massive damage onto Landorus-T and Gliscor. Non-Rockium Z Iron Boulder can struggle with Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Great Tusk. Because of this, having a switch-in like your own Landorus-T or Gliscor is very helpful. Additionally, Iron Boulder can be revenge killed by Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, so having answers to it like Volcarona and Gouging Fire is important. Iron Boulder appreciates hazard support from Pokemon like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Glimmora, as it can chip checks that would otherwise just fall short of a KO. Furthermore, physical wallbreakers such as Kartana and Mega Lopunny that can put Landorus-T and Gliscor in range of a +2 Mighty Cleave are also appreciated, especially since Gliscor can’t use Protect to heal with Poison Heal against Mighty Cleave, and Landorus-T doesn't have any reliable recovery. Finally, Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Volcarona that can break through foes like Alomomola, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor are also greatly appreciated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With an Assault Vest, Iron Crown becomes a nearly impenetrable special tank, capable of stomaching attacks from the tier's strongest wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant, Tapu Lele, and Mega Diancie. However, its lack of longevity means it can be worn down very quickly by Spikes damage, making it only suitable for highly aggressive offense teams. Volt Switch complements such teams, bringing Iron Crown's wallbreaking teammates in safely against passive switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking. Psychic Noise punishes passive Pokemon which attempt to absorb Iron Crown's Volt Switch such as Gliscor and Ferrothorn by preventing them from healing, whereas Tachyon Cutter threatens less specially bulky Volt Switch blockers such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Future Sight combined with Volt Switch helps teammates such as Zamazenta and Urshifu-R. Alternatively, Focus Blast lets Iron Crown be more individually threatening, scaring Ferrothorn and Heatran, and dealing slightly more damage to Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar compared to Tachyon Cutter. The given EV spread maximizes Iron Crown's special bulk while allowing it to receive a Special Attack boost in Electric Terrain via Quark Drive, permitting it to be more threatening on offensive teams. A Calm nature and maximum Special Defense investment can be used instead to bolster Iron Crown's special bulk, especially if it forgoes Assault Vest for the increased longevity Heavy-Duty Boots provides. Tera Fairy is Iron Crown's preferred Tera type to invert its Dark weakness against Darkrai, Mega Tyranitar, and Hisuian Samurott; as another option Tera Water provides a Water resistance in a pinch against aggressive rain teams. Iron Crown fits best on offensive teams that appreciate a non-passive defensive backbone against special attackers that can provide support via pivoting and Future Sight. Landorus-T is its best partner, as it functions similarly as a pivot with access to Stealth Rock and U-Turn, complementing Iron Crown by checking physical attackers such as Garchomp and Gouging Fire. It also provides an Electric immunity, which Iron Crown appreciates as it fails to prevent Raging Bolt and Zapdos from freely setting up Calm Mind or pivoting with Volt Switch, respectively. In the same vein, Alomomola forms a potent defensive core alongside Iron Crown, pivoting into physical attackers and increasing Iron Crown's longevity via Wish support. Iron Crown's usage of Psychic Noise is bolstered by entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Heatran, as Psychic Noise ensures entry hazard damage sticks by disabling foes' passive Leftovers recovery. Iron Crown pairs well with Pokemon that pressure Ground-types such as Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R, as they prevent Gliscor and Ting-Lu from hindering its functions as a pivot. Alternatively, Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Ursaluna can utilize Iron Crown pivoting out against walls such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking to find opportunites to wallbreak. Additionally, Iron Crown finds a role on Electric Terrain teams fueled by Tapu Koko, with a Quark Drive boost making it more threatening or even bulkier. In return, Iron Crown indirectly supports Tapu Koko by helping fellow teammates on Electric Terrain teams such as Hawlucha and Iron Valiant wallbreak, with Future Sight pressuring checks such as Toxapex and Zapdos.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Iron Crown is a potent setup sweeper in the tier. With decent bulk and useful resistance, it is able to set up on some offensive Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T as well as ignore Toxic from passive Pokemon like Alomomola. Maximum Speed investment with just 172 Special Attack EVs ensures Iron Crown gets a Speed boost from Quark Drive, allowing it to outspeed many popular threats in the tier such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Zamazenta alongside common Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R, so it can set up first against the former foes and not be revenge killed by the latter. Focus Blast is a powerful coverage move that hits Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Hisuian Samurott, which are immune to Stored Power, for super effective damage. Iron Defense complements Calm Mind to turn Iron Crown into a nigh-indestructible powerhouse and provides a boost to Stored Power, while Tachyon Cutter can be used for its immediate damage output against Fairy-types and Garganacl or to better deal with opposing Psychic-type Pokemon such as Iron Boulder and Mega Latias better. Tera Fighting makes Focus Blast a STAB move, allowing it to OHKO Heatran unboosted and Ferrothorn at +1, as well as giving Iron Crown a resistance to Dark-type moves from Darkrai and Tyranitar that it would be weak to otherwise. Tera Flying provides an immunity to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp and a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Zamazenta, and is a better defensive type overall due to it only having a few weaknesses. Calm Mind Iron Crown only becomes dangerous after a few boosts, therefore, dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Tapu Koko are exceptional partners, as their screens provide more opportunities for Iron Crown to start setting up. Iron Crown also has great synergy with Tapu Lele, which provides Psychic Terrain to prevent it from being revenge killed by priority moves like Thunder Clap from Raging Bolt and Sucker Punch from Hisuian Samurott and Mega Mawile, as well as increase the damage of Stored Power.</p>"

Nasty Plot is the key to success, offsetting its natural passivity to make it a threat to Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Gliscor. Maligant Chain is a great STAB attack that cripples checks like Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar with its fifty percent chance to badly poison, and further disrupt them with confusion due to its ability. Shadow Ball in tandem with Ghostium Z lets Pecharunt annihilate common switch ins like Gliscor, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn once boosted while providing a nuclear attack for Pecharunt in general. Recover lets Pecharunt have longevity against Pokemon it would use as fodder such as the aformentioned Gliscor and Ferrothorn, while letting it reliably check Zamazenta and Rillaboom. 168 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Modest Heatran. While Pecharunt has a great defensive typing, it often can be worn down by switching into strong physical attackers like Zamazenta, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny often and because of how prone it is to entry hazards. Hazard removal options like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Corviknight fix said entry hazard problems for Pecharunt while also checking the aforementioned physical attackers. In return, Pecharunt's ability to dismantle balance teams is very appreciated by Pokemon like Corviknight and Mega Scizor. Offensive teammates like Ogerpon-W and Mega Lopunny complement Pecharunt well due to their sheer strength that can be further exacerbated by Pecharunt fishing for poison against foes with Malignant Chain; Pecharunt also helps them against revenge killers like Zamazenta and Choice Scarf Kartana. While Ghostium Z helps Pecharunt break through Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex, it doesn't appreciate facing them in general. Teammates that check the aforementioned like Gliscor and Iron Crown can help fend them off for Pecharunt to reliably set up and sweep.</p>"
