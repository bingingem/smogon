Hisuian Arcanine greatly struggles with being revenge killed by faster threats like Roaring Moon, Chien-Pao, and Zamazenta, so it appreciates defensive teammates like Corviknight and Manaphy. Slow pivots like the aforementioned Corviknight and Manaphy can help give Hisuian Arcanine more opportunities to wallbreak. Hisuian Arcanine can struggle with Well-Baked Body Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Skarmory, so teammates like Sandy Shocks and Zamazenta can help by breaking through them.</p>"

Knock Off, on top of dealing solid damage, is a fantastic disruption tool, debilitating Choice item users like Primarina and opposing RegenVest users like Manaphy. Poison Fang allows Alolan Muk to spread deadly poison against potential switch-ins like Great Tusk; Rock Slide hits Zapdos, Iron Moth, and Volcarona hard; and Ice Punch provides a strong hit against Dragonite and Sandy Shocks. Thunderbolt is an option over Ice Punch, allowing Alolan Muk to do some semblance of damage to Corviknight and Skarmory. Physical walls are ideal teammates for Alolan Muk, with options like Great Tusk and Corviknight primed to deal with physical attackers like Zamazenta, Ceruledge, and Kingambit that seek to prey on its mediocre physical bulk; they can also remove entry hazards, allowing it to make the most out of Regenerator. Using Alolan Muk means that you aren't taking advantage of an alternate RegenVest user with pivoting like Manaphy or Swampert, relegating it entirely to bulky teams that can take advantage of its unique traits while compensating for its weak points. Alolan Muk is a significant momentum sink and often needs additional support for powerful boosted threats like Sandy Shocks and Primarina; specially bulky pivots like Earth Eater Empoleon make great teammates to fill in these gaps.</p>"

Skill Swap also reliably forces out and generates a free turn against any Pokemon slower than Gengar such as Sandy Shocks and Beads of Ruin Walking Wake, as they will be unable to hit it through Normalize. This makes Gengar one of the most reliable Toxic Spikes setters, as it threatens most common removal options like Corviknight and Great Tusk. Gengar is an excellent teammate for fast special cleaners like Azelf, Deoxys-S, and Iron Moth, as they benefit tremendously from opposing special walls being removed or weakened with Toxic Spikes. Gengar struggles against teams with fast Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao, as it cannot meaningfully damage them and is immensely threatened by them, making Pokemon like Fluffy Corviknight and physically defensive Manaphy great partners; they can also provide a slow pivot to get Gengar in safely. Weather Ball from Pokemon with Primordial Sea or Desolate Land bypasses Normalize, meaning Gengar cannot reliably force out common users like Walking Wake and Volcanion, so sturdy checks to them like RegenVest Swampert and Blissey make solid teammates.</p>"

Frail offensive Pokemon like Azelf, Chien-Pao, and Barraskewda benefit from Swampert, as its slow pivoting lets them come in more safely, and they can also take advantage of its Knock Off removing items from their common checks such as Deoxys-D and Corviknight. Swampert maintains much of its special bulk through its Assault Vest, so it's vital to have Knock Off absorbers such as Corviknight and Great Tusk for Swampert to more reliably check special attackers. Grass-resistant Pokemon like Heatran and Well-Baked Body Gholdengo are also good teammates for Swampert, as special attackers such as Iron Moth and Deoxys-S frequently run Grass-type coverage predominantly for it.</p>"

Adaptability Luster Purge consistently OHKOes common slower offensive Pokemon like Zapdos without dropping Latios's Special Attack, but Trick can cripple an opposing Chansey or Deoxys-D or disrupt a setup sweeper like Cresselia. Adaptability provides the most overall power to the set, letting it reliably 2HKO common RegenVest pivots like Swampert and Manaphy with Psyshock, while Tinted Lens lets it 2HKO Meloetta and Empoleon with Psyshock and have a good chance to OHKO Corviknight and Gholdengo with Draco Meteor. Latios pairs well with fast cleaners like Deoxys-S and Hisuian Electrode, as they can readily take advantage of the opposing RegenVest user being removed from the match. Strong physical wallbreakers like Iron Boulder and the Ogerpon formes appreciate Latios bringing them in safely with Flip Turn and even chunking their checks like Corviknight that may try to eat a predicted Psyshock. Latios invites in powerful Dark-type revenge killers like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao, making robust checks to these such as Fluffy Corviknight and Regenerator Primarina mandatory. Latios functions best with frequent entry to the field, making entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk excellent partners.

Adaptability is more consistent, as it is always active and does not announce itself, while Hadron Engine can support Electric-types and Surge Surfer users, disrupt opposing terrain from the likes of Azelf and Deoxys-S, and let Latios OHKO Corviknight with Thunderbolt. Trick is an option in the last slot to shut down bulky setup sweepers like Cresselia and cripple walls like Deoxys-D. Latios works best with slow pivots like Corviknight and Swampert that can get it onto the field in advantageous positions; similarly, Latios often provides easy entry to slow, wallbreaking teammates like Galarian Zapdos and Ceruledge with Flip Turn. Latios is heavily threatened by Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon, as they discourage it from using its Psychic-type moves and can even threaten it thanks to priority moves and Choice Scarf, respectively.

Calm Mind allows Latios to set up against passive foes such as Corviknight and Skarmory. Soul Dew notably makes Adaptability Draco Meteor a guaranteed 2HKO on Corviknight after a Calm Mind, but Leftovers is an option to give Latios more longevity. Adaptability is the preferred ability for consistent high damage, allowing Latios to reliably 2HKO Blissey and RegenVest Swampert with Psyshock, while Tinted Lens is an option to threaten an OHKO on Corviknight and Gholdengo with Draco Meteor after a Calm Mind and 2HKO Heatran and Hisuian Goodra with Psyshock after a boost. Latios works fantastically with other powerful special attackers such as Iron Moth, Zapdos, and Azelf, as they all appreciate RegenVest users and Blissey being weakened. Latios also appreciates slow, physically bulky pivots such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and physically defensive Manaphy, who which can both pivot it in safely and effectively check the offensive Dark-types that threaten Latios such as Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao.

Many of the best physical walls such as Corviknight and Manaphy survive by barely avoiding 2HKOs, which they fail to when switching into Future Sight as well, while others like Iron Hands, Great Tusk, and Pecharunt take far too much damage from Future Sight anyway. Doom Desire is an alternative with no immunities that also hits Scream Tail harder but otherwise has worse coverage against relevant targets. Psychic Noise denies recovery to Empoleon and Corviknight and punishes aggressive Iron Moth and Great Tusk switch ins. The last moveslot is extremely flexible; Thunderbolt for Corviknight, Iron Head for Scream Tail, Ice Punch for Dragonite, and Body Slam to fish for paralysis are some of the most notable options. Jirachi should be paired with physical wallbreakers on more offensive teams, as they best take advantage of its combination of slow pivoting and Future Sight. Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Zamazenta, Ceruledge, and the Ogerpon formes are excellent teammates that also appreciate Jirachi switching into fast Psychic-types like Deoxys-S and Azelf attempting to revenge kill them. Jirachi is weak to several common special attackers, most notably primal weather users like Iron Moth and Primarina, and Ghost-types such as Gengar and Gholdengo, so teammates that can offensively check them like other primal weather users and Roaring Moon are greatly appreciated.

Ice Beam is used to hit Ground- and Dragon-types hard, such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon. Energy Ball can be used to beat Swampert while also pressuring Water- and Ground-types instead of being forced to predict. Superpower acts as Deoxys-S's main physical attack, being able to hit specially defensive walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Blissey, and Meloetta. Knock Off helps Deoxys-S and its teammates by crippling RegenVest users to be taken on better later in the game. Entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes let Deoxys-S potentially weaken defensive checks for itself and its teammates. Life Orb is used to more easily use Deoxys-S's mixed potential but can reduce how many times how many times its able to switch in.

Cresselia also appreciates teammates such as Mandibuzz, Blissey, and RegenVest Hisuian Goodra that can switch into Ghost-types.</p>"}},

Scald's burn chance looms over physical attackers looking to take advantage of Manaphy's lower physical bulk. Knock Off is used to remove key items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Assault Vest from potential switch-ins like Swampert, Corviknight, and Desolate Land Iron Moth. Ice Beam dissuades Roaring Moon and Dragonite from setting up on Manaphy. Energy Ball is optionally usable to hit Swampert and opposing Manaphy. Manaphy is excellent at switching into attacks from Heatran, Gholdengo, and Primarina, utilizing a slow U-turn to bring in strong but frail wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Iron Boulder. Great Tusk is a good partner, being immune to the Electric-type attacks Manaphy is weak to, doubling as a top tier entry hazard remover, switching into Knock Off attempts from the likes of Roaring Moon and Mandibuzz. Manaphy should be aware of Knock Off, as it is heavily reliant on Assault Vest to provide defensive value. Manaphy can be overwhelmed by teams with multiple special wallbreakers like Deoxys-S, Hisuian Electrode, Azelf, and Latios, so it should be run either with a secondary special wall or on more offensive teams that limit opposing wallbreakers. Investing in Defense is also an option, allowing Manaphy to switch into threats like Chien-Pao, Barraskewda, and Cinderace and pivot out while using Assault Vest to function as a mixed wall.</p>"

Scald is used as its main STAB move but can be substituted for Weather Ball on Primordial Sea sets as a stronger STAB move and a way to hit incoming Desolate Land Pokemon like Ceruledge and Heatran. Ice Beam helps deal with Dragon-types like Latios, Roaring Moon, and Dragonite. Energy Ball helps with taking on Water-types likes Swampert, Primarina, and opposing Manaphy. Finally, Tail Glow-boosted Psychic OHKOes Iron Moth and Toxapex and 2HKOes Desolate Land Ceruledge. Manaphy appreciates pivots such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Deoxys-D that have the ability to safely get it onto the field to let it clean up games much easier and help it get through its sweep by providing entry hazard control. Manaphy is also able to help these pivots by providing offensive pressure and being able to end games for them. Manaphy struggles to deal with specially bulky walls such as Blissey, Hisuian Goodra, and Unaware Deoxys-D, so it partners up well with Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Roaring Moon, and Latios to help deal with them and pressure them into more unfavorable positions. Manaphy also works well on hyper offense teams if using Protosynthesis due to Booster Energy being single-use; on these teams, it likes to be supported by other special wallbreakers such as Latios, Gholdengo, and Azelf that can help to wear down specially bulky checks for Manaphy like Blissey, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge.</p>"

Ceaseless Edge is a versatile move that deals good damage to foes while also setting up Spikes, helping Hisuian Samurott's teammates or even itself to pick off chipped foes later in the game. Knock Off provides utility by removing items from switch-ins such as Corviknight and Quaquaval. Sucker Punch is a good priority move that lets Hisuian Samurott deal heavy damage to faster foes such as Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Zapdos. Brick Break can be used instead to deal with dual screens leads such as Corviknight and Mew. Hisuian Samurott's ability to set up Spikes and pester defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Scream Tail by removing their items is appreciated by various offensive teammates such as Chien-Pao and Galarian Zapdos that can take advantage of chipped foes. Fluffy and Intimidate Quaquaval wall Hisuian Samurott very easily, so spinblockers such as Desolate Land Skeledirge and Ceruledge are good partners as they can pressure Quaquaval and block it from removing Spikes set by Hisuian Samurott.

Black Glasses is the item of choice, boosting its Dark-type moves without the recoil of Life Orb. Pokemon like Thundurus and Iron Moth are very useful teammates, as they compensate for Hisuian Samurott's average Speed tier and can heavily damage physical walls that counter Hisuian Samurott like Quaquaval and Zamazenta-C. In return, Hisuian Samurott wears down special walls with its ability to set up a layer of Spikes.

Psychic is an alternative option that dents Iron Hands, Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Iron Moth. Sheer Force lets Hisuian Zoroark hit harder to achieve feats such as 2HKOing non-Unaware Mandibuzz. A Timid nature should be used on sets with Nasty Plot, as a higher Attack is not needed. Teammates such as Iron Moth and Azelf appreciate Hisuian Zoroark's ability to force chip damage on special walls such as RegenVest Manaphy and Meloetta. Hisuian Zoroark is very frail, leaving it prone to revenge killing attempts from revenge killers like Roaring Moon and Azelf, so it appreciates slow pivots like Corviknight and Manaphy that can help it switch in safely.

Will-O-Wisp further weakens these special walls, forcing them to be worn down over time and notably enabling Hisuian Zoroark's Hex to break past them; it also cripples physical threats like Great Tusk and Iron Hands. U-turn allows Hisuian Zoroark to generate free momentum for its team while forcing its switch-ins to take chip damage from entry hazards as it pivots out, whereas Taunt denies Blissey and Empoleon recovery. Hisuian Zoroark should be paired with offensive entry hazard setters like Sandy Shocks, Pixilate Scream Tail, and Galvanize Kommo-o that can keep up the pressure on hazard removers to maximize its ability to wear the opposing team down over time. Sturdy checks to offensive threats that force Hisuian Zoroark out like Roaring Moon, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and Azelf are needed, so good teammates that can stave them off like Great Tusk and Empoleon are recommended.</p>"

Defog allows Mandibuzz to act as an excellent hazard control option that is appreciated by wallbreakers and pivots like Chien-Pao, Roaring Moon, and Azelf, while Knock Off can cripple other switch-ins like Corviknight, Magic Guard Quaquaval, and Galarian Zapdos. Unaware allows Mandibuzz to better check setup threats like Bulk Up Great Tusk, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Swords Dance Ceruledge, while Well-Baked Body allows it to check Cinderace and Ogerpon-H while still checking the aforementioned Swords Dance Ceruledge, and Fluffy allows it to have an easier time checking wallbreakers like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Barraskewda, and Galarian Zapdos. Mandibuzz has a poor matchup against certain wallbreakers like Chien-Pao and Iron Boulder; thus, a secondary physical wall like Intimidate Corviknight is appreciated.

Foul Play allows Mandibuzz to beat physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Ceruledge, while Knock Off can limit the longevity of defensive walls and remove Assault Vests, enabling special attacking teammates like Primarina, Latios, and Azelf. Toxic can cripple walls such as Swampert and Scream Tail and shuts down bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Scream Tail and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Defog provides valuable entry hazard control, especially for Stealth Rock-weak wallbreakers Chien-Pao, Ceruledge, and Ogerpon-H, which Mandibuzz can also slow pivot in with U-turn alongside 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature. Leftovers provides passive healing that can't be mitigated by indirect damage, while Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves, most notably U-turn from Corviknight and Roaring Moon. Mandibuzz naturally loses to many of the tier's common physical attackers, including Chien-Pao and Ogerpon-C, exacerbated by the fact that it lacks a true defensive ability or immunity; other physically defensive walls such as Corviknight and Toxapex help shore up these weaknesses. Although Mandibuzz can be an emergency switch-in to Psychic-types like Azelf, Deoxys-S, and Latios, it should generally not be relied on due to its uninvested special bulk and their various super effective coverage moves.

With U-turn, Landorus-T can switch out of bad matchups against the likes of Dragonite, Well-Baked Body Skarmory, and Primordial Sea Zapdos and bring in Pokemon like Azelf, Iron Hands, and Iron Boulder to check them. Thanks to Desolate Land, Landorus-T is able to successfully wall Empoleon, Barraskewda, and non-Ice Beam Swampert, as well as prevent them from pivoting. Landorus-T helps strong physical attackers such as Roaring Moon and Zamazenta, since they have some trouble breaking through physically defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Fluffy Mandibuzz. Landorus-T also helps special attackers such as Gengar and Latios that have difficulty breaking through specially defensive Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon, which also don't like the hazard chip damage it provides. However, Landorus-T struggles against Dragonite and Well-Baked Body Pokemon such as Skarmory and Chesnaught; Corviknight and Deoxys-D can be used to check Dragonite, while Zapdos and Primarina are options for beating Skarmory and Chesnaught. Landorus-T also tends to struggle against mixed walls such as Manaphy and Ting-Lu; therefore, Iron Hands and Hisuian Electrode make for good partners.</p>"

Taunt prevents the setting of entry hazards by Skarmory and Ting-Lu and the use of Roost and Defog by Corviknight and Mandibuzz. Stealth Rock allows Landorus-T to wear down a great deal of Pokemon, but it typically chips Choice-item Pokemon such as Azelf, Roaring Moon, and Latios. Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, as it allows Landorus-T to chip down U-turn Pokemon like Corviknight and non-Magic Guard Roaring Moon, but Leftovers can also be used to increase its longevity. 8 Speed EVs allow Landorus-T to outpace maximum Speed Modest Primarina, while the rest are poured into HP and Attack to increase its overall bulk and offense. Knock Off users like Roaring Moon and Manaphy make great partners for Landorus-T as they are able to remove Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Corviknight, and Great Tusk, allowing it and its teammates to make progress faster. Landorus-T struggles against physical attackers like Chien-Pao and Barraskewda, so physical walls like Corviknight and Manaphy make good partners. Stealth Rock quickly wears down Landorus-T, especially Rocky Helmet variants, so hazard removal options like Corviknight and Great Tusk are mandatory.</p>"

Chesnaught mostly finds its home on stall teams, where it can find plenty of teammates to switch into its common weaknesses, especially Fire and Psychic, and can find multiple switch-in opportunities to try and activate Flame Body, which is one of the few ways for stall teams to punish pivoting. Chesnaught is especially horrified of Fire-types like Ceruledge and Cinderace, as they can obliterate it without fear of a burn, and it cannot touch Ghost-types like Gengar and Hisuian Zoroark without Knock Off, so teammates like Well-Baked Body Mandibuzz are strongly recommended.</p>"

Hisuian Goodra has many options to fill the last two moveslots based on its team's needs: Earthquake hits Ceruledge, Heatran, and opposing Hisuian Goodra, while Flamethrower hits Corviknight and does more damage to non-Well Baked Body Gholdengo than Knock Off when its item has been removed already. Thunderbolt hits non-Volt Absorb Corviknight and Manaphy, Ice Beam threatens Great Tusk and Dragonite, and Draco Meteor is a strong STAB move that can OHKO Latios and does significant damage to Roaring Moon. Hisuian Goodra lacks pivoting unlike other RegenVest users such as Manaphy and Meloetta, so it finds its place on bulkier teams that can afford hard switching. Hisuian Goodra pairs well with strong but frail offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos, wearing down the opponent's team and giving these threats the opportunity to clean up. Entry hazard removers such as Corviknight are great partners for Hisuian Goodra, allowing it to make full use of Regenerator. It also pairs well with hazard setters such as Deoxys-S thanks to Knock Off's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes and Dragon Tail's phazing. Hisuian Goodra heavily relies on its item to function, so it dislikes being hit by Knock Off from Roaring Moon and Manaphy; it also struggles against physical attackers such as Iron Boulder and Galarian Zapdos, so physically defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Deoxys-D are great partners, as they can take hits for it, with the former also being able to absorb Knock Off.</p>"

With Defog, Corviknight can help control entry hazards, and with the help of its abilities, it can clear them in front of hazard setters such as Desolate Land Landorus and Heatran with Well-Baked Body or Sandy Shocks and Archaludon with Volt Absorb. Corviknight will most often run Leftovers for extra healing, though it can also run Eject Button with Well-Baked Body to safely bring in a teammate once and be a better check to Ceruledge. With an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD, Corviknight can better check Pokemon like Roaring Moon as well as Cinderace with Well-Baked Body, while with an alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD, it can reliably check Pokemon like Latios as well as Zapdos with Volt Absorb; it should also be noted that Well-Baked Body sets prefer to be physically defensive, while Volt Absorb sets prefer to be specially defensive.

Polteageist also cannot hurt most Dark-types in a meaningful way, so it enjoys having teammates like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Hands, which can help remove most of them. Even though Polteageist can outspeed most unboosted Pokemon after a Shell Smash boost, it still struggles with Deoxys-S and most Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Azelf, Roaring Moon, and Latios because they can easily outspeed it and KO it, so having speed control support from either Sticky Web or priority users like Dragonite is appreciated. Finally, Polteageist only works on offensive teams, as it's unable to provide much outside of setting up once and attempting to sweep, so supporting that sweep with teammates that provide either entry hazards, like Deoxys-S and Smeargle, or dual screens, like Corviknight and Regieleki, is a great boon to Polteageist.</p>"

Rapid Spin is used as not only entry hazard removal for Quaquaval and its teammates but also a way to let it outspeed and threaten foes like Hisuian Electrode, Galarian Zapdos, and Iron Boulder. Knock Off can be used to both remove items from Pokemon like Corviknight, Deoxys-D, and Mandibuzz, as well as hit Ghost-types such as Ceruledge and Gholdengo. U-turn is a less prominent option to be able to pivot on checks like Corviknight and Manaphy. Roost is used to keep Quaquaval healthy potentially allowing it to outlast its checks, while Swords Dance can be used as a way to let it end games by blasting through its checks like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and physically defensive Manaphy. Offensive Psychic-types such as Azelf, Iron Boulder, and Deoxys-S appreciate Quaquaval's presence, as it's able to take on Dark- and Steel-types such as Roaring Moon, Chien-Pao, and Gholdengo for them. Quaquaval is slow, and struggles to deal with faster foes such as Deoxys-S, Dragonite, and Latios, so it benefits from having teammates like Swampert, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz to help with checking them defensively and bringing it in safely.</p>"

Stealth Rock lets Garganacl support its teammates by providing entry hazards, while with Iron Defense or Curse, Garganacl can set up on and more easily check Pokemon like Iron Hands, Ceruledge, and Dragonite, and boost Body Press or Earthquake, depending on the set. When using Body Press, Garganacl can more efficiently take on Chien-Pao as well as a majority of other Pokemon, while with Earthquake, it can deal with Iron Boulder and Pecharunt. Protect lets Garganacl deal extra damage with Salt Cure active as well as gain some extra Leftovers recovery. Garganacl can either use Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots, the former letting it gain more recovery through Protect and the latter helping Garganacl switch in more often. Garganacl provides great defensive support to frail offensive Pokemon, like Iron Moth, Gengar, and Galarian Zapdos, as a to check faster Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Iron Boulder. Garganacl can struggle against special attackers, such as Deoxys-S, Azelf, and offensive Gholdengo, so having specially defensive teammates, like Hisuian Goodra, Manaphy, and Blissey, can help. Garganacl enjoys being on more defensive teams for having teammates that can take on physical attackers with it, such as Pecharunt, Mandibuzz, and Primarina, as it struggles to reliably check Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Zamazenta, and Barraskewda.</p>"

An Adamant nature helps Ceruledge secure certain KOs, most notably OHKOing Swampert with Poltergeist, but Jolly allows it to outspeed Gholdengo and neutral-natured Great Tusk. Ceruledge requires slow pivots like Primarina, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz to get it onto the field, with the former covering Latios and the latter two providing valuable Defog support while also checking dangerous revenge killers like Roaring Moon and Dragonite. Ceruledge also pairs well with offensive pivots like Azelf and Zapdos, both of which require help to break past RegenVest users such as Manaphy and Swampert; in return, they give it more opportunities to come in to wallbreak. However, Ceruledge cannot be paired with Knock Off as this nullifies Poltergeist, limiting its synergy with the aforementioned RegenVests users and common Choice Scarf users like Roaring Moon and Meowscarada.

Body Press, when coupled with maximum Defense investment, deals consistent damage to Corviknight, while Ice Spinner can be used to hit Flying-type switch-ins like both Zapdos formes and Dragonite. Knock Off debilitates switch-ins like Corviknight and Zapdos by removing their Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots, respectively. Alternatively, Great Tusk can use Stealth Rock if none of its teammates are capable of setting it. Bulk Up can also be considered to increase Great Tusk's offensive presence, but is typically less preferred than other utility options. Scrappy notably prevents Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Pecharunt from spinblocking Great Tusk. Alternatively, Regenerator provides Great Tusk with reliable recovery it otherwise lacks, while Fluffy allows it to better check attackers such as Roaring Moon and allows a teammate like Swampert to use Regenerator instead. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Great Tusk can more reliably remove entry hazards by avoiding chip damage from them, while Leftovers provides recovery for non-Regenerator sets, and Rocky Helmet can be used to punish attackers that make contact. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards off the field such as Azelf and Chien-Pao pair well with Great Tusk's Rapid Spin support. Due to its poor special bulk, Great Tusk appreciates specially bulky Pokemon, such as Heatran, Empoleon, and if not using Regenerator, RegenVest Pokemon such as Manaphy and Swampert.

Pivots such as Roaring Moon and Galarian Zapdos are also great partners, as they can bait in Pokemon that Iron Hands can easily take advantage of to set up, such as Primarina and Corviknight.</p>"

Well-Baked Body allows Gholdengo to wall Pokemon reliant on Fire-type moves to beat it, such as Iron Moth, Cinderace, and Ogerpon-H lacking Knock Off. Similarly, Earth Eater handles opposing Ground-types such as non-Scrappy Great Tusk. Bulletproof is used to negate Shadow Ball from Gengar, Hisuian Zoroark, and opposing Gholdengo. Gholdengo's natural typing allows it to use nearly any immunity ability effectively, so options like Water Absorb and Volt Absorb can also be used depending on the needs of its team, although these are generally less effective. 28 Speed EVs are used to outspeed minimally invested Great Tusk, with the remaining EVs being used to maximize Gholdengo's physical bulk to better check physical attackers. Gholdengo is particularly vulnerable to Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao, and many Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Ogerpon-C run Dark-type coverage specifically to hit all variants of it. Thus, Pokemon that can take hits from Dark-type attackers such as Corviknight and Great Tusk make good partners. Gholdengo cannot check most special attackers, so it appreciates having special walls such as Swampert and Manaphy as teammates.

Recover, while it doesn't seem as though it would fit on a Choice Scarf Pokemon, is the preferred option in the fourth moveslot, as it greatly improves Gholdengo's longevity and becomes quite usable after it uses Trick.

A Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed maximum Speed Great Tusk, Chien-Pao, and non-Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, but Choice Specs is an alternative option that allows Gholdengo to 2HKO specially defensive RegenVest Manaphy and Jirachi and pressure RegenVest users harder. Gholdengo pairs well with strong wallbreakers like Deoxys-S and Primarina, as they are able to break down bulky walls like Hisuian Goodra and Swampert, allowing Gholdengo to clean up. Gholdengo also pairs well with entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Garchomp, as the Spikes they set up can quickly wear down RegenVest Pokemon. While being a niche set, Surge Surfer Iron Hands pairs incredibly with Gholdengo, as it requires Electric Terrain to be up for it to function as a cleaner. Gholdengo struggles to find opportunities to safely switch in, so slow pivots such as Corviknight, Manaphy, and Swampert are appreciated. Hazard removers like Great Tusk and Corviknight are necessary to prevent Gholdengo from being worn down by Spikes, especially if it's not running Recover.

  "Iron Boulder": {
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Iron Boulder is one of the best single-button clickers imaginable; honestly, the other moves are mostly decorative. Sharpness- and Choice Band-boosted Mighty Cleave has excellent power and coverage, notably 2HKOing Unaware Deoxys-D and OHKOing most slower offensive Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Roaring Moon. Psycho Cut covers important targets like Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Swampert, while Throat Chop reliably beats Gholdengo, and Sacred Sword beats Iron Treads and Hisuian Goodra. Iron Boulder has an awful defensive typing and greatly appreciates being brought in by slow pivots like Manaphy and Corviknight; thanks to its great Speed tier, it can usually force out the wallbreakers that come in on them in return. Iron Boulder also pairs well with other physically offensive threats like Barraskewda and Garchomp that can wear down opposing walls like Intimidate Corviknight with it. Fluffy walls such as Corviknight and Deoxys-D are extremely difficult for Iron Boulder to break past, so a strong Fire-type like Iron Moth or Ceruledge makes an excellent teammate.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With an amazing Speed stat and great STAB moves, Iron Boulder stands out as one of the tier's strongest wallbreakers. Swords Dance lets it tear through some of the tier's most common physical walls including Great Tusk, Deoxys-D, and non-Fluffy Corviknight. Iron Boulder has plenty of options as a last move: Sacred Sword helps deal with Steel-types like Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit, and Iron Treads, as well as Regenerator Ting-Lu; Throat Chop notably hits Gholdengo; and Earthquake acts as a midground option, hitting the aformentioned Sacred Sword targets and non-Earth Eater Gholdengo at the cost of not getting boosted by Sharpness. Iron Boulder appreciates offensive pivots like Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, as they're able to clean up after it has weakened the physical walls. Iron Boulder also appreciates defensive pivots like Corviknight and Swampert, as they can bring it in safely. Despite its amazing Speed stat, it's still prone to getting revenge killed by faster targets like Chien-Pao, Hisuian Electrode, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, making defensive walls like Corviknight, Meloetta, and Great Tusk necessary. Iron Boulder lacks damage without a boost from Swords Dance, so entry hazard setters like Deoxys-D, Sandy Shocks, and Skarmory are greatly appreciated, as they help chip foes into its KO range.</p>"

  "Iron Crown": {
    "sets": {
      "Double Dance": {
        "description": "<p>The combination of Calm Mind and Agility, which lets Iron Crown outspeed almost the entire metagame after just one use, gives it the potential to be a deadly setup sweeper. Stored Power gives Iron Crown scaling damage, letting it 2HKO offensive threats like Iron Moth and Zamazenta after one Agility and OHKO them after one Calm Mind with some chip damage. Additionally, it lets Iron Crown 2HKO specially defensive Garchomp and RegenVest Iron Hands at +4, which can be easily achieved by letting its Weakness Policy activate. Furthermore, with one Agility boost and after Weakness Policy has activated or Calm Mind has been used twice, it lets Iron Crown OHKO even Psychic-resistant Pokemon like Corviknight and Gholdengo and 2HKO most RegenVest users, like Manaphy and Swampert. Iron Crown is heavily reliant on setup moves to perform its role, so it is easily shut down by Taunt, can be stopped by dedicated special walls like Blissey and Chansey, and needs teammates like Chien-Pao and Ogerpon-H that can handle them. A dual screens setter like Corviknight or Deoxys-S is appreciated to help Iron Crown with both activating its Weakness Policy and setting up safely. Bulky Dark-types like Mandibuzz and Kingambit give Iron Crown a lot of trouble, so teammates like Galvanize Kommo-o and Iron Hands are needed to remove them.</p>"

  "Pecharunt": {
    "sets": {
      "Prankster": {
        "description": "<p>Pecharunt uses its tremendous physical bulk, useful slate of resistances, and Prankster Parting Shot + Destiny Bond to anchor defensive cores, pivot to dangerous attackers, and eliminate opposing wincons in an emergency. Prominent physical attackers like Zamazenta, Iron Hands, and the Ogerpon formes struggle to break through it. Prankster Destiny Bond allows Pecharunt to trade itself for an opposing setup sweeper or cleaner that its team cannot handle, especially since it can alternate between Destiny Bond and its attacking move to keep the effect active. Malignant Chain is the preferred attack for its wonderful poison chance, but Shadow Ball is an option for its higher PP and ability to touch Corviknight. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred option to maximize Pecharunt's ability to pivot freely without the need to recover, especially since Pecharunt's removal of Toxic Spikes lets it support teams without strong entry hazard removal, but Black Sludge is an option on teams with very reliable entry hazard control. Colbur Berry is a niche item to better check Roaring Moon. Pecharunt struggles mightily against Roaring Moon, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao, as it cannot even pivot against them, so sturdy checks to them like Corviknight, Skarmory, and physically defensive Manaphy are strongly recommended. Pecharunt is petrified of Ceruledge, so teammates like Well-Baked Body Mandibuzz and Eject Button Garchomp are appreciated. Offensive teammates like Deoxys-S, Latios, and Roaring Moon love the free switches in Pecharunt generates with Parting Shot and its ability to switch into their revenge killers.</p>"

      "Physical Wall": {
        "description": "<p>Pecharunt is a solid physical wall with a massive Defense stat and valuable Ghost typing that allows it to handle the tier's many strong Fighting-type wallbreakers like Iron Hands, Galarian Zapdos, and Slither Wing. Toxic is mandatory on Corrosion sets and has more consistency and PP than Malignant Chain, but Malignant Chain provides a secondary STAB option that immediately threatens Ogerpon-W and Ogerpon-H. Hex pairs nicely with Toxic and should always be used on Corrosion sets, but Shadow Ball grants a stronger immediate hit, especially against Steel-types like Corviknight and Empoleon. Pecharunt can safely pivot in frail offensive teammates like Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-C, and Sandy Shocks with Parting Shot, while also being a great switch-in to dangerous revenge killers like Barraskewda and Zamazenta that threaten them. Well-Baked Body allows Pecharunt to shut down Fire-type wallbreakers like Cinderace and Ogerpon-H, while Intimidate pushes its already tremendous walling capabilities even further, letting it act as a hard counter to the aforementioned Fighting-types. Earth Eater is another option that allows Pecharunt to handle Garchomp and Great Tusk, as well as letting it safely block the latter's Rapid Spin. Black Sludge provides passive healing, while itemless lets it wall Ceruledge with Well-Baked Body and take less damage from Knock Off Roaring Moon. Pecharunt is weak to some of the tier's common physical attackers, including Iron Boulder, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao, so it appreciates support from other physically defensive walls like Corviknight and Skarmory. Pecharunt's middling special bulk means that it struggles against the tier's special attackers, most notably Iron Moth, which it struggles to do meaningful damage against; RegenVest users such as Hisuian Goodra, Swampert, and Manaphy help cover these weaknesses.</p>"
