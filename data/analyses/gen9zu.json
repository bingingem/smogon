    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charizard has Dragon Dance and Swords Dance in its arsenal for setting up without sacrificing half of its HP, but Charizard's Attack isn't amazing without multiple boosts, so Charizard needs teams to be significantly worn down before it can sweep. Solar Power makes Charizard a capable sun attacker, though Charizard is worn down quickly by Stealth Rock and the ability's recoil, and it faces competition from Scovillain as a sun sweeper. All-out attacker Charizard can run Focus Blast for greater damage against Rock-types, Snorlax, and Porygon2, but Scorching Sands has reliable accuracy and lets Charizard fish for burns on these targets. Belly Drum Charizard can run Tera Ground to turn the tables on Rock-types and Electric-types, and the boost in power to Earthquake lets Charizard reliably OHKO Regirock and Naclstack. Tera Dark on Belly Drum Charizard can protect Charizard from moves affected by Prankster coming from foes like Grafaiai and Sableye.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Jolteon requires little chip damage to revenge kill Charizard, and Choice Specs Jolteon can OHKO Charizard outright. Choice Scarf users like Qwilfish, Magneton, and Rotom-C also have super effective STAB moves to revenge kill Charizard with less chip damage, and they also gain momentum against it with their pivot moves. Grafaiai, Sneasel, and Mismagius are strong attackers faster than Charizard, but few revenge killers can switch into it safely or repeatedly. Floatzel is unique as a fast physical revenge killer that doesn't fear burns thanks to Water Veil.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Regirock is quite difficult for Charizard to break on its own, and still threatens Charizard even when it is burned. Sturdy on Hisuian Avalugg can help it survive even a +6 Earthquake from Belly Drum Charizard and retaliate with a strong Mountain Gale or Rock Blast, but its low special bulk leaves it very vulnerable to all-out attacker Charizard. Naclstack is an excellent wall to all-out attacker Charizard thanks to Recover, Purifying Salt shielding it from burns, and great bulk with Eviolite, but Belly Drum Charizard can OHKO it with a +6 Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Snorlax can use all-out attacker Charizard as an opportunity to set up, and Porygon2 walls it. Snorlax doesn't mind damage or burns thanks to Rest. Muk dislikes burns but can take repeated hits from Charizard and wear it down with Poison Jab and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Lanturn only minds burns cutting into its passive recovery, and it can gain momentum from Charizard with Volt Switch, threaten to spread burns with Scald, and heal away damage with Rest.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Charizard's high Speed, great Special Attack, and unique offensive and defensive typing make it a great all-out attacker, checking many common Grass-types like Whimsicott and Shaymin. Charizard's Hurricane is one of its strongest attacks and has few common resistances. Flamethrower has more reliable accuracy than Hurricane, destroys Steel-types like Magneton and Orthworm that can otherwise handle Hurricane, and melts Ice-types like Glastrier. Scorching Sands covers Regirock and Lanturn, lets Charizard fish for burns, and is a more accurate move than Hurricane against foes like Typhlosion. Will-O-Wisp punishes physical attackers like Snorlax and Regirock that would otherwise try to take advantage of Charizard. Tera Ground stops fast Electric-types like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton from taking advantage of Charizard with Volt Switch and flips its major 4x Rock weakness into a resistance to better handle Regirock and Sandaconda. Offensively, Tera Ground gives Charizard great odds to 2HKO Lanturn and always 3HKO defensive Muk after Stealth Rock chip.</p> <p>Charizard appreciates pivots like Jolteon and Whimsicott bringing it in safely on Pokemon that check them like Orthworm and Magneton; Charizard also benefits from these teammates checking Water-types like Floatzel, Lanturn, and Clawitzer that it otherwise struggles with. Regirock is a great teammate for Charizard, as it can check special walls like Snorlax and Porygon2 for Charizard and is an even sturdier wall to the threats Charizard burns with Will-O-Wisp. Grass-type partners like Virizion, Rotom-C, and Dipplin cover Charizard's weaknesses and are complemented by Charizard handling Whimsicott. Charizard is a great check to Palossand, one of the toughest walls for Hisuian Sneasel and Passimian, so they benefit from having Charizard as a partner while they threaten one of Charizard's biggest checks in Regirock.</p>"

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>After a Belly Drum, Charizard becomes a deadly sweeper capable of OHKOing most Pokemon that don't resist Acrobatics. Even physical walls like Weezing and Palossand are KOed by +6 Acrobatics after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake wrecks bulky Pokemon that resist Acrobatics like Magneton, and at +6, Charizard's Earthquake OHKOes even Regirock after Stealth Rock damage and Naclstack. Earthquake has a small perk of avoiding negative contact effects such as Rocky Helmet damage from Qwilfish. Flame Charge makes Charizard harder to revenge kill by fast Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Rotom, and at +6, it is likely to OHKO Orthworm after Stealth Rock damage. Sitrus Berry restores some of Charizard's health given that Stealth Rock and Belly Drum both take 50% of its HP, and it easily allows Charizard to consume its item and maximize damage from Acrobatics. Tera Flying boosts Acrobatics, allowing Charizard to reliably OHKO physical walls like Sandaconda and Palossand and take neutral damage from Aqua Jet users like Qwilfish and Veluza that can revenge kill it.</p> <p>Belly Drum Charizard usually has just one chance to sweep, so it primarily features on hyper offensive teams built around fast-paced setup sweepers. Charizard benefits immensely from teammates that set entry hazards, enabling it to OHKO foes like Palossand and Regirock, all of which could otherwise survive its onslaught; offensive teammates like Hisuian Avalugg and Primeape can reliably set Stealth Rock, and Qwilfish and Hisuian Qwilfish can set Spikes for Charizard. Sandslash is an excellent partner for Charizard, as it can set up hazards, remove hazards with Rapid Spin, and check Rock- and Electric-types for Charizard. Parting Shot users like Grafaiai and Alolan Persian can weaken foes and ease Charizard's time setting up. Memento users like Mismagius and Whimsicott can put Charizard in a good position to sweep by debuffing foes. Offensive pivots like Mesprit and Whimsicott can bring Charizard into favorable matchups against Pokemon they lure in like Orthworm and Articuno. Other physical attackers like Brute Bonnet, Glastrier, and Qwilfish can break holes in teams so that Charizard can clean up afterwards, and they all appreciate its great Speed and potential to sweep.</p>"

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>Magneton secures itself a place in the ZU metagame by virtue of its excellent power, a typing that is useful both offensively and defensively, and its ability to reliably pivot against many teams. Magneton's Steel typing is very rare in ZU, and it can hold Eviolite to shore up its mediocre bulk. This gives it a unique niche as a bulky pivot that provides a rare form of defensive utility while still hitting quite hard. Alternatively, Choice item sets are effective offensive threats thanks to Magneton's excellent STAB combination and great ability in Analytic, which can situationally boost its already good power even further. Magneton's Steel-type STAB moves are very threatening to most of the tier's Ground-types, which allows all sets to pivot reliably against many teams. However, Magneton's bulk is very poor, which prevents Choice item sets from providing much defensive utility, and Eviolite sets are simply not as threatening as their Choice item counterparts. Magneton's Steel typing also saddles it with unsavory weaknesses to Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks; the first two are especially problematic, as Magneton is slower than most of the tier's Fire- and Fighting-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulkier spread on the Eviolite set can work if you want to focus on Magneton's ability to take hits; if choosing to invest into bulk, dipping below 136 Speed EVs with a Modest nature is not advised, as Magneton will become slower than Brute Bonnet. The Choice Specs set could choose Tera Fighting with Tera Blast to 2HKO Porygon2 and Snorlax after Stealth Rock without having to take itself out due to recoil, but pivoting out of them with Volt Switch is generally more effective, and they are greatly pressured by Steel Beam anyway. More defensively oriented Tera types, such as Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost, can be considered, as they give Magneton a Fighting resistance while turning its other weaknesses into neutralities. Thunder Wave over Tera Blast on Eviolite sets is a decent option to spread paralysis, but most Magneton switch-ins don't mind being paralyzed that much or are outright immune to the move. Metal Sound is an additional option on the Eviolite set that lets Magneton break through Dipplin, Porygon2, and Snorlax, but it is overall niche compared to the other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Volt Absorb Lanturn is one of the only Pokemon that doesn't care about Magneton's STAB attacks at all; even an Analytic-boosted Steel Beam doesn't hit it all that hard. It also blocks Volt Switch thanks to Volt Absorb and can use Magneton as an opportunity to pivot safely to a teammate or spread burns with Scald. It does have to watch out for Tera Blast Grass, however.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Snorlax, Porygon2, and Muk are decent checks to Magneton due to their ability to sponge its main STAB attacks. Porygon2 also has reliable recovery that lets it perform this role safely and consistently throughout a game. Steel Beam's immense power pressures even them, however, and none of them prevent Magneton from pivoting out of the bad matchup with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types, such as Sandaconda, Palossand, and Sandslash block Volt Switch from Magneton and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB moves. They are not true switch-ins, however, as Magneton's Analytic boosted Steel-type STAB moves are still greatly threatening to them.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Charizard, Typhlosion, Magmortar, and Pyroar can OHKO Magneton with their STAB moves, and they are all faster than variants lacking a Choice Scarf. They also resist Magneton's Steel-type STAB moves, but none of them are true switch-ins due to their inability to block Volt Switch or reliably switch into Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type coverage</strong>: Fighting-types such as Passimian, Hisuian Sneasel, and Hitmonlee all threaten to revenge kill Magneton; Choice Scarf Passimian is even faster than Choice Scarf Magneton. Additionally, common Fighting-type coverage from the likes of Orthworm, Regirock, and Naclstack prevents Magneton from comfortably dealing with them one-on-one depending on what coverage move it is locked into. None of them can directly switch in, however.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Magneton's Steel typing makes it an excellent offensive answer to common Pokemon like Mesprit, Grafaiai, and Hisuian Qwilfish, giving it plenty of opportunities to switch in, attack, and pivot out. Most Ground-type Pokemon like Sandaconda and Sandslash that would otherwise block Magneton's Volt Switch cannot reliably switch into Magneton's Analytic-boosted Flash Cannon and avoid being KOed by a follow-up Flash Cannon. Analytic makes Magneton painful to switch around; it's also complemented by Magneton's many resistances and solid bulk when holding Eviolite. Tera Blast Grass enhances Magneton's coverage, enabling it to punish troublesome Electric-immune foes like Lanturn and Ground-types. Tera Fairy helps give Magneton a Fighting resist against Pokemon likelike Passimian and Virizion, while being able to hit them and other checks like Virizion and Dipplin for big damage. Tera Flying also eases Magneton's otherwise poor matchups against Fighting-types, and it turns its 4x Ground weakness into an immunity to make it less vulnerable to Ground-types like Sandslash, Palossand, and Sandaconda; although a Spikes immunity can help Magneton as a pivot, the Stealth Rock weakness is a huge hindrance and should normally be used late game to avoid this. Even without Terastallizing, Tera Blast is a decent standalone attack that hits Jolteon and Lanturn harder than Flash Cannon would. 84 Speed allows you to outrun Defensive Pivot Mesprit, with rest in bulk giving it more longevity.</p> <p>VoltTurn teams welcome Magneton as a strong offensive pivot that adds to their defensive backbone with its Steel typing. Other pivots like Passimian and Floatzel can create cores with Magneton and cause opponents to end up lost in the vortex. Strong wallbreakers like Brute Bonnet and Glastrier appreciate Magneton bringing them in safely with Volt Switch, and they have the bulk and power to answer problematic Ground-types for Magneton. Volt Absorb Lanturn walls Magneton and prevents it from pivoting with Volt Switch, so Magneton relies on Grass-type partners like Virizion and Lurantis to put pressure on it. Specially defensive Pokemon like Porygon and Snorlax are excellent answers to Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion that threaten Magneton. Magneton cannot afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots given the greater bulk provided by Eviolite, so it often ends up worn down by entry hazards; hazard removers like Lurantis and Sandslash can mitigate Magneton's vulnerability to this as it pivots in and out, and they appreciate Magneton checking threats to them like Mesprit and Braviary. Psychic-weak Pokemon like Passimian and Qwilfish appreciate Magneton checking Mesprit for them. Magneton's Steel typing similarly gives it opportunities to switch in and threaten Articuno out as well, which is appreciated by Ice-weak teammates such as Palossand and Brute Bonnet. Mesprit and Mismagius appreciate Magneton pressuring Hisuian Qwilfish, which they otherwise struggle against. Physical attackers like Passimian and Brute Bonnet benefit from Magneton threatening Weezing, one of their most significant checks, and they support Magneton in return by threatening special walls like Snorlax and Porygon2 for it.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Magneton is one of the most feared wallbreakers in the entire tier. Many teams are completely incapable of safely switching into Magneton thanks to its great STAB combination and access to Analytic, which amps up its power even further. Volt Switch complements Magneton nicely, as it is still quite powerful and allows Magneton to keep up momentum for its team. Magneton is generally quite good at pivoting, as many of the Pokemon immune to Electric, such as Palossand, Sandslash, and Sandaconda, fear Magneton's Steel-type STAB moves. Steel Beam is a monstrously powerful attack that is capable of hitting several notable power benchmarks, including OHKOing Sandaconda and Regirock so they can't KO Magneton back. While the massive recoil damage prevents it from being a staple attack, it gives a teammate free entry into battle should Magneton take itself out due to recoil. Tera Steel is preferred to jack up the power of Flash Cannon and Steel Beam even more, allowing the former to reliably 2HKO Jolteon and specially defensive Mesprit and the latter to 2HKO Snorlax and Porygon2. However, Tera Blast with Tera Grass allows Magneton to threaten standard checks such as Lanturn and various Ground-types with high damage while also becoming resistant to their STAB moves. Analytic allows Magneton to hit switch-ins much harder than it would be able to otherwise, which has great synergy with its threatening wallbreaking profile as well as Volt Switch. It also boosts its power should it have to take a hit before moving, which can be useful versus weak moves that Magneton resists, such as STAB moves from Mesprit and Farigiraf. However, such situations should generally be avoided due to Magneton's middling bulk. A Timid nature is recommended in order to outrun Timid Farigiraf.</p> <p>Choice Specs Magneton fits well on teams ranging from offense to balance teams due to its ability to act as a strong wallbreaker and a reliable pivot. Magneton's toolkit is appreciated by a variety of offensive teammates. Magneton's power is intimidating, but special walls such as Snorlax and Porygon2 can check it. Teammates with powerful Fighting-type coverage, such as Passimian and Regirock, are good teammates, as are Grass-types, such as Dipplin, Virizion, and Brute Bonnet. Their ability to threaten Ground-types that might try to absorb Magneton's Electric-type STAB moves while still being able to break through standard special walls is very useful for Magneton, and they can also switch into annoying Ground-types, such as Sandaconda, Palossand, and Sandslash. Magneton, in return, can bring them in safely with Volt Switch and threaten physical walls such as Weezing, Orthworm, and Qwilfish. Switch-ins to Fire-types are also needed, as Magneton is easily revenge killed by foes such as Charizard, Typhlosion, and Pyroar. Bulky Water- and Rock-types, such as Lanturn and Regirock, are therefore good teammates. Faster, frailer partners also appreciate Magneton's wallbreaking and pivoting capabilities; Passimian, Floatzel, and Grafaiai appreciate Magneton threatening to break down defensive cores and bringing them in safely with Volt Switch. The first three can also form a pivoting core with it, while Passimian and Grafaiai can also use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from specially defensive Magneton checks, making them even more vulnerable to chip damage. On a related note, Magneton also benefits significantly from entry hazards being on the opponent's side of the field, as several of its bulkier checks, such as Porygon2 and Snorlax, do not normally hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Stealth Rock setters such as Mesprit, Sandaconda, and Regirock can set up the hazard reliably to assist Magneton's wallbreaking capabilities, and they are generally not significantly threatened by Magneton's bulky checks. Spikes setters such as Qwilfish, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Orthworm also work well. Teams utilizing Magneton require additional preparation for Lanturn, which is one of the only Pokemon in the tier that switches into Magneton with impunity and largely prevents it from performing its role as a wallbreaking pivot unless Magneton is packing Tera Grass. Dedicated Lanturn answers such as the aforementioned Grass-types as well as specially bulky teammates such as Porygon2 and Snorlax make for good teammates as a result.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf turns Magneton into an effective revenge killer and general anti-offense Pokemon, as it outruns the entire unboosted metagame bar Jolteon. It also has a limited, but still notable, defensive profile, and its ability to pivot brings a lot of utility to the table. Volt Switch allows Magneton to keep up momentum for its team and effectively pivot. Steel Beam allows Magneton to wallbreak should the need arise and hits extremely hard with an Analytic boost. However, the massive recoil makes it a situational attack. Tera Steel allows Magneton to power up Flash Cannon and Steel Beam significantly. On the other hand, Tera Blast Grass allows Magneton to pressure Lanturn and Ground-types such as Sandaconda, Sandslash, and Palossand with more confidence, allowing it to pivot more reliably against teams with these threats or to lure them in and KO them outright. It also gives Magneton a Ground resistance, further improving its matchup versus the aforementioned Ground-types. A Timid nature is required so Magneton can outrun Whimsicott and Floatzel. Analytic allows Magneton to pick up several KOs, such as 2HKOing Palossand and Sandaconda with Flash Cannon on the switch and doing the same to Orthworm with Thunderbolt and Lanturn with Tera Blast Grass.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Magneton is a good choice for many bulky offense and outright offensive teams. Magneton is the slowest viable Choice Scarf user, and it is unsuitable for revenge killing Speed-boosting sweepers, such as Oricorio-F and Agility Braviary, and other Choice Scarf users, such as Passimian, Floatzel, and Typhlosion. Other ways of taking care of these threats are therefore necessary. Prankster Encore users like Whimsicott, Grafaiai, and Sableye can greatly irritate and deter setup from the aforementioned setup threats, while the first two can form a pivoting core with Magneton. Meanwhile, defensive checks to the other Choice Scarf users, such as Sandaconda, Weezing, and Palossand for the former, and Lanturn and Porygon2 for the last two, serve to greatly assist Magneton. Magneton can help these teammates out by bringing them into battle safely with Volt Switch and revenge killing unboosted offensive foes for them. Magneton also benefits from teammates that can effectively take down Lanturn and problematic Ground-types. Strong Grass-types, such as Virizion, Brute Bonnet, and Alolan Exeggutor, can switch into and pressure these foes. Magneton's tendency to force these threats to switch in also opens the door for them to enter battle via advantageous double switches. Other powerful wallbreakers, such as Glastrier, Sneasel, Hitmonlee, and Clawitzer, can also threaten these foes, while Magneton can bring them in to battle safely with Volt Switch; the first three pressure special walls, such as Porygon2 and Snorlax, that can sponge Magneton's attacks. Articuno is another notable teammate, as it forms a pivoting core with Magneton, threatens many of its checks with Freeze-Dry, and can annoy setup sweepers that Magneton cannot deal with via Haze.</p>"

Its bulk allows it to easily spread status through Will-O-Wisp and Sludge Bomb, making Weezing incredibly irritating to switch into. However, Weezing lacks any reliable recovery, making it easy to wear down over the course of a game. Its mediocre special bulk means it folds to any strong special attack. Weezing also faces competition from fellow Poison-types Qwilfish and Hisuian Qwilfish, which have access to Spikes and pivoting moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Weezing's lacking Special Defense makes it susceptible to any strong neutral attack from the likes of Charizard, Mismagius, and Jolteon. However, Sludge Bomb's nasty poison chance makes it hard to consistently switch these attackers in.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As tanky as Weezing is, its lack of reliable recovery leaves it prone to being overwhelmed, especially in longer games versus bulkier teams. Strong attacks can easily bypass Pain Split's weak healing, leaving Weezing vulnerable to being forced past by attackers like Sneasel and Dodrio.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Mesprit can easily switch in on Weezing, only fearing Sludge Bomb's poison chance, threaten it out, and use it to set entry hazards, pivot with U-turn, set up Substitute or boosts, or do any other of the million things it does. Farigiraf can also easily enter on Weezing and start boosting. Less common Psychic-types like Malamar, Indeedee-F, and Veluza still scare Weezing out with super effective Psychic-type attacks and use it to force progress throughout the game, though none of them enjoy being poisoned or burned.</p>",

Haze denies setup sweepers like Swords Dance Virizion and Hitmonlee. Taunt messes with defensive foes, denying attempts at setting entry hazards, spreading status, and recovery. Toxic Spikes messes with grounded Pokemon like Regirock and is great into bulkier teams. Rocky Helmet chips away at physical attackers using contact moves. Levitate lets Weezing hover over Spikes as well as Ground-type moves, letting it ignore Earthquake from Passimian and Sandaconda. Tera Steel makes Weezing resist Psychic-type attacks from Mespirit and Farigiraf, as well as a ton of other types like Flying, Normal, and Ice, making it a better check to many physical attackers like Dodrio and Glastrier. However, Tera Steel makes Weezing weak to Fighting-type attacks, reducing its effectiveness as a check to Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Passimian.</p> <p>Balance teams can tend to struggle against the many strong Fighting-types like Hitmonlee and Passimian, so Weezing is a great fit on these teams to take this pressure off its teammates.

Weezing is one of the few counters to Poison-types like offensive Qwilfish and Grafaiai, a very useful trait compared to other balance staples like Regirock and Palossand, which can get overwhelmed by coverage and poison. Glastrier is another wallbreaker that balance teams struggle with, and Weezing can help its team dance around it. As Weezing can't take special hits very well, special walls like Lanturn and Orthworm are helpful for sponging the special attacks aimed at Weezing. Lanturn and Orthworm coincidentally form a powerful defensive core with Weezing, with Weezing covering Lanturn's Grass- and Ground-types for Lanturn and Fighting-types for Orthworm. In return, Lanturn blanket checks most special attackers for Weezing, particularly the Fire-types that can enter on a predicted Will-O-Wisp, as well as Magneton, which can use Weezing as an easy entry point. Porygon2 and Snorlax appreciate Weezing's Fighting resistance and, in return, handle threatening special attackers like Mismagius and Rotom for it. Offensive threats like Glastrier and Sneasel appreciate having Weezing to fall back on against would-be revenge killers like Passimian.</p>"

However, the lacking power of its coverage moves causes it to struggle quite hard against specially defensive Pokemon like Snorlax and Porygon2 as well as Ground-types like Sandaconda.

However, slotting Tera Blast makes Jolteon more reliant on team support to weaken its checks, and Terastalizing Jolteon into an Ice- or Fire-type requires entry hazard removal. Jolteon still gets walled by Grass-types if running Tera Blast Water.

Alluring Voice discourages certain Grass-types like Virizion and Brute Bonnet from switching in and also targets Dragon-types like Dipplin and Alolan Exeggutor that would be comfortable switching into its Electric-type STAB moves. It also hits Tera Dragon users like Sandaconda and Regirock, walls that would otherwise switch into Jolteon without too much trouble. Shadow Ball hits Mesprit harder than any of its STAB moves do while also hitting Ghost-types like Palossand and Mismagius quite hard. While Jolteon's Tera type is flexible, Tera Blast Ice synergizes the best when striking back at its overall checks, hitting Ground-types like Sandaconda and Sandslash and Dragon-types like Alolan Exeggutor and Dipplin. However, this comes at the cost of using up the Terastallization slot. Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost, on the other hand, strengthen Alluring Voice and Shadow Ball, respectively, and make Jolteon slightly better at taking Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Passimian and Virizion. Volt Absorb allows Jolteon to switch in against predicted Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like opposing Jolteon.</p> <p>Jolteon's blistering Speed makes it a prime candidate for VoltTurn teams, pairing well with pivots like Mesprit, Passimian, and Grafaiai. In addition to pivoting, they all can provide utility with Knock Off. Knock Off support works especially well with Jolteon, as its Volt Switch is able to put more pressure on Pokemon reliant on items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots for longevity, such as walls like Snorlax and Regirock. Wallbreakers like Qwilfish and Glastrier benefit from Jolteon's Volt Switch and can capitalize on its checks. Grass- and Water-types like Shaymin, Virizion, Qwilfish, and Poliwrath can switch in and force out the Ground-types Jolteon struggles against and delay its need to Terastallize. Similarly, checks to Grass-types like Qwilfish formes and Articuno can similarly benefit Jolteon either through entry hazard and status support or through pivoting, respectively, allowing it to Terastallize as a later time. Deterrents to Snorlax like Regirock and Passimian are valuable for pressuring it to Terastalize sooner, which can be exploited by teammates like Qwilfish formes and Hisuian Sneasel.</p>"

Jolteon can form VoltTurn cores with fellow pivots like Passimian, Qwilfish formes, and Grafaiai, keeping momentum while threatening Jolteon's checks like Snorlax and Alolan Exeggutor. Water-types like Qwilfish and Clawitzer pair excellently with Jolteon, threatening out Ground-types like Sandslash and Palossand that intend to block Jolteon's Volt Switch while maintaining a VoltTurn core.

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Continuing its dramatic fall from grace from the higher tiers, Snorlax now establishes itself as a dominant force in ZU with its Curse sets. Thanks to its overall outstanding bulk and offensive versatility, Snorlax is quite difficult to stop once it gets stat boosts, even when factoring in Rest turns. Snorlax isn't just limited to late-game cleaning, either — it can also use said bulk and Thick Fat to function as a reliable sponge to common special attackers like the Oricorio-F, Jolteon, and Typhlosion while also being a good paralysis spreader with Body Slam. Walls comfortable switching into Body Slam also have to be aware of Heat Crash, limiting the consistency of its switch-ins. However, its low Speed and reliance on Rest or Protect for recovery make it quite easy to pressure it into passivity and cost momentum for its team. Snorlax's lack of resistances also makes it easy for Fighting-types like Virizion and Passimian to pressure it to Terastallize earlier than expected, which forces careful play to ensure a successful sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snorlax's coverage move is quite flexible -— Crunch hits Ghost-types like Palossand and Drifblim harder, while Heavy Slam more heavily pressures Tera Fairy setup sweepers like Mesprit. However, Crunch is usually noticeably weaker compared to Heat Crash, and Heavy Slam worsens its matchup against Steel-types and Tera Steel Pokemon and is still walled by Rock-types. Sleep Talk over Curse makes Snorlax more consistent as a special wall at the cost of its late-game potential. Heavy-Duty Boots is a notable alternative to Leftovers, allowing Snorlax to fare better against entry hazards and easing the need for hazard removal. However, Snorlax usually appreciates the passive recovery from Leftovers better. Offensive sets like Choice Band are usable to surprise the opposition but are held back by Snorlax's low Speed and giving up quite a lot of its bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Hisuian Avalugg, Regirock, and Naclstack are not particularly bothered by even a boosted Snorlax and can set up Stealth Rock or pressure it with repeated uses of Body Press, with the latter two even using it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Fighting-types like Virizion and Passimian can threaten huge damage on Snorlax with their Fighting-type STAB moves, though none of them particularly enjoy it Terastallizing to Fairy. Hisuian Sneasel can even threaten Snorlax even when the latter Terastallizes with its Poison-type STAB moves. Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage like Clawitzer, Glasterier, and Braviary can also pressure it into Terastallizing sooner than expected.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong physical wallbreakers like Glastrier, Dodrio, and Braviary can strike at Snorlax's initially lower physical bulk and cause it to use Rest sooner than expected.</p> <p><strong>Coil Sweepers</strong>: Orthworm can consistently keep up and eventually overpower Snorlax thanks to its Steel typing. While Sandaconda cannot outright beat Snorlax without critical hits, it can outlast Snorlax by PP stalling and can brush off status with Shed Skin.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Snorlax's Leftovers is an essential part for it to wall and sweep teams; Knock Off users like Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Dodrio endanger its chances of sweeping and follow up with strong STAB moves in their arsenals. Trick and Switcheroo users like Whimsicott, Grafaiai, and Mismagius can outright neuter Snorlax's sweeping potential with a Choice item, forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Snorlax hates taking residual damage, with common entry hazard setters like Orthworm, Qwilfish, and Sandaconda making it more difficult for Snorlax to sweep; the latter two can also rack up additional chip damage with Rocky Helmet. Status like burn and poison also forces Snorlax to use Rest, causing it to become more passive. Snorlax also can quickly get worn down by VoltTurn users like Mesprit, Whimsicott, and Jolteon as a switch-in to them, risking losing momentum against them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>STAB Body Slam not only functions as Snorlax's primary attacking move but also threatens incoming switch-ins like Qwilfish formes and Passimian with the chance of paralysis. Heat Crash is a powerful coverage move that hits both Ghost-types like Rotom, Mismagius, and Sableye that would freely switch into Body Slam and Tera Steel users like Weezing and Mesprit. Rest fully restores Snorlax's health and removes existing status conditions at the expense of making it passive for two turns. Alternatively, Protect scouts for Choice-locked foes like Passimian and Rotom and racks up additional Leftovers recovery at the cost of being unable to remove status. Tera Fairy turns its Fighting weakness into a resistance and provides an immunity to Dragon-type moves from foes like Dipplin and Alolan Exeggutor. Tera Fairy Snorlax also benefits from Poison- and Steel-type moves being uncommon. Thick Fat strengthens its defensive profile by making it a consistent switch-in to Fire- and Ice-types like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Froslass.</p> <p>Snorlax excels mid- or late-game as a setup sweeper that can take advantage of Fighting-types and wallbreakers being worn down. Physical walls like Qwilfish, Regirock, and Palossand shore up Snorlax's lower physical bulk and can provide entry hazards to wear down switch-ins like opposing Qwilfish and Regirock; they are also excellent as Knock Off absorbers to preserve Snorlax's Leftovers. Choice item wallbreakers like Whimsicott and Jolteon can simulataneously provide wallbreaking and pivoting support for Snorlax to enter the field safely; they can help discourage physical walls like Palossand and Qwilfish formes from freely switching in. Poison-types like Qwilfish and Weezing can help with Snorlax's weakness to Fighting-types and provide additional utility. Rock-types like Regirock, Naclstack, and Hisuian Avalugg can easily ward off anything Snorlax can do, so checks to them like Virizion, Shaymin, and Weezing are helpful to consistently force them out. Palossand stands out, as it can not only check the aformentioned Rock-types but also Fighting-types thanks to its excellent bulk and typing. Due to Snorlax's utility as a special wall and susceptibility to residual damage, hazard removers like Sandslash and Lurantis are critical in preventing Snorlax from being worn down by hazards; the lack of hazards make it far more consistent walling foes and sweeping throughout a game.</p>"

A more offensive EV spread using Hurricane can catch faster or more offensive Pokemon expecting to get the jump on Articuno off-guard, letting Articuno nail foes weak to Freeze-Dry like Brute Bonnet, Rock Blast Sandaconda, and Clawitzer while still maintaining its good bulk. However, Articuno is not very strong on its own and tends to be outclassed by other offensive pivots like Mesprit, Passsimian, and Whimsicott for their superior power, coverage, and utility from moves like Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo. Tera Ground alleviates Articuno's 4x Rock weakness and gives it an immunity to Electric to enable it to block Volt Switch, but it worsens Articuno's matchups against specially offensive Grass-types like Whimsicott, Calm Mind Virizion, and Alolan Exeggutor that it's meant to check.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Articuno's 4x Rock weakness makes Rock-type moves a huge threat to it. Regirock and Hisuian Avalugg can threaten out Articuno and use it as an opportunity to set up entry hazards. Naclstack cannot get frozen, can recover off chip damage from Articuno, and wears Articuno down with Salt Cure. Sandaconda and Virizion commonly run Rock-type coverage but must be wary of Articuno's Freeze-Dry and strong Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Articuno depends on its Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid losing 50% of its HP to Stealth Rock as it switches in, so losing them hurts its longevity and pushes it to Terastallize. Mesprit is a common special attacker that can lure Articuno in and threaten to use Knock Off or give it a Choice item with Trick. Mismagius and Whimsicott respectively run Trick and Switcheroo.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Orthworm shrugs off attacks from Articuno, threatens it with its Steel-type STAB moves, and can set up Coil or entry hazards on it. Magneton is only chipped by Articuno's attacks, threatens it with its STAB moves, and can keep up momentum if Articuno switches out with its STAB Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Jolteon, Rotom, and Alolan Raichu resist Hurricane, threaten Articuno with their Electric-type STAB moves, and can gain momentum with Volt Switch. All three of the Electric-types can use setup moves to blow through Articuno.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Charizard and Typhlosion overcome Articuno's massive special bulk thanks to their super effective STAB attacks. Although Typhlosion resists Freeze-Dry, it prefers not to take damage in order to preserve the power of its Eruption. Oricorio-F can use Taunt on Articuno and set up on it with Quiver Dance and Roost. However, all of them struggle to break through Tera Dragon Articuno.</p>",

Special attackers like Whimsicott and Shaymin struggle to break through Articuno on their own. Roost keeps Articuno healthy and lets it take repeated hits from special wallbreakers like Alolan Exeggutor and Clawitzer while stonewalling more passive Pokemon like Dipplin and Porygon2. Freeze-Dry has the best coverage and reliability of any of Articuno's moves, nailing Grass- and Water-type special attackers like Arboliva and Lanturn. U-turn helps Articuno keep up momentum against wallbreakers that might switch in against it like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Magneton. Haze immediately removes boosts from special setup users like Mesprit and Farigiraf. Roar is an alternative to Haze that lets Articuno rack up residual damage from entry hazards, but it forces Articuno to move second and fails if the target is the last active member of its team. Tera Dragon helps Articuno beat Fire-types it struggles against like Charizard and Typhlosion. Tera Steel gives Articuno a Toxic immunity and lets it more reliably check attackers like Grafaiai, Alolan Exeggutor, and Farigiraf.</p> <p>Articuno is a great choice for balance teams in need of a specially defensive Pokemon. However, Articuno can also support more offensive teams thanks to U-turn enabling teammates like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Clawitzer. Pokemon vulnerable to Grass-types and special attackers such as Dipplin and Palossand greatly appreciate Articuno's support, and they can assist it against threatening physical attackers like  and Floatzel and Passimian. Articuno can form cores with other pivots like Passimian, Jolteon, and Qwilfish. Articuno's 4x weakness to Rock is a major vulnerability that can be covered by partners like Virizion, Orthworm, and Palossand. Entry hazard setting partners like Naclstack, Regirock, and Hisuian Qwilfish complement Articuno running Roar, as Articuno racks up hazard damage with Roar, forces Dipplin out even if it Terastallizes, and pressures other Pokemon vulnerable to hazards like Snorlax and Regirock to switch in. Knock Off users like Mesprit, Grafaiai, and Passimian support Articuno if it runs Roar to rack up entry hazard chip damage by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes dependent on them to avoid hazard damage such as opposing Articuno, Sandslash, and Charizard. Articuno struggles with Fire-types like Typhlosion and Charizard, so Snorlax and Regirock partner well with it by bolstering against these bad matchups. Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton can respectively set up on Articuno and break through it, so teammates like Virizion, Passimian, and Virizion can threaten them for Articuno.</p>"

  "Typhlosion": {
    "overview": "<p>Choice Specs Typhlosion is an insanely powerful special attacker in a tier without much in the way of sturdy Fire-resistant Pokemon. Much of its power comes from its move Eruption, which has unparalleled strength with Typhlosion at full health and can OHKO most neutral targets such as Mesprit and Passimian. With Typhlosion's Speed tier, it outspeeds much of the unboosted metagame, meaning that it can frequently come in and pick up KOs. However, Choice Specs Typhlosion struggles against faster Pokemon such as Grafaiai and Choice Scarf users like Passimian that can damage it before it moves and limit its power; it's also checked by the few Pokemon that can take on its Eruption reliably such as Snorlax and Poliwrath, necessitating a team to have good answers to them such as Regirock and Dipplin, respectively. On the other hand, the Choice Scarf set misses some OHKOs such as against Mesprit and Palossand, but it outspeeds common Choice Scarf users like Rotom and Passimian and fast attackers like Sneasel and Jolteon. Typhlosion's Eruption is limited by Stealth Rock as well as other damaging entry hazards, meaning it requires hazard removal support from the likes of Sandslash and Hisuian Avalugg.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots might seem tempting to ignore entry hazards and preserve the power of Typhlosion's Eruption, but this comes with the trade-offs of sacrificing vital power or Speed on Typhlosion, leaving it otherwise outclassed by Charizard once Eruption is no longer at full power. An alternative Tera type like Ground might seem interesting for Typhlosion to catch fast revenge killers like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton off guard while powering up its Scorching Sands. However, Typhlosion should prioritize using its Fire-type moves to their fullest, as it without Tera Fire, it will otherwise miss out on KOs such as Choice Scarf Mesprit after Stealth Rock damage, Jolteon, and Mismagius.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and even Toxic Spikes ruin Typhlosion's stand-out power and the reason to use it. Sticky Web leaves Typhlosion prone to being outsped.</p> <p><strong>Special Sponges</strong>: Snorlax, Porygon2, and Regirock can withstand Eruptions from Typhlosion. Typhlosion can deal significant damage to these Pokemon with Focus Blast, but the inconsistent accuracy and commitment of locking into a coverage move are hard on Typhlosion. Scorching Sands hits Lanturn for solid damage, but Typhlosion dislikes locking into it due to its low power and exploitability by foes immune to Ground such as Orthworm, Mesprit, and Rotom-C. Defensive Terastallization flips Articuno from easy prey for Typhlosion to a wall capable of burning through the low PP of Typhlosion's moves with Pressure.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune or Resistant to Fire</strong>: Typhlosion should prioritize using Eruption, so Pokemon immune to it and Pokemon that can tolerate it are a huge issue if Typhlosion is to keep its Eruptions powerful. Porygon2's Trace can copy Flash Fire from Typhlosion. Lanturn can pivot into Typhlosion's Fire-type moves and generate momentum with Flip Turn or Volt Switch. Charizard and Clawitzer can retaliate with a strong hit against Typhlosion to impair its power after they withstand one Tera Fire Choice Specs Eruption. Oricorio-F can boost its Special Defense with Quiver Dance and stall Typhlosion out of Eruptions with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Even chip damage wrecks the power of Eruption, and Typhlosion's lacking Defense and defensive typing leave it prone to being picked off once it's in range of Blaze. Aqua Jet from the Qwilfish formes and Floatzel is especially harmful to Typhlosion. Even otherwise easy targets like Brute Bonnet, Hitmonlee, and Dodrio can clip Eruption's power to make Typhlosion easier to handle.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Specs Typhlosion is speedy but still slower than Grafaiai, Jolteon, and Mismagius as well as Choice Scarf users like Mesprit, Rotom, and Passimian.

Fire Blast and Flamethrower are to be used when Typhlosion gets weakened; both options are valid and come down to personal preference between power and accuracy. Fire Blast namely gives better odds to OHKO threats such as Sandslash and Passimian. Focus Blast gives Typhlosion a chance to 2HKO Snorlax, which can easily take Fire-type attacks, as well as being its strongest move against Rock-types like Regirock and Naclstack. Scorching Sands targets Fire-types such as opposing Typhlosion and Pyroar as well as some bulky Water-types like Lanturn and Qwilfish, and it is a more accurate option to threaten Rock-types. Flash Fire lets Typhlosion switch into powerful Fire-type attacks without losing power on Eruption, but this leaves it vulnerable to Trace Porygon2. Blaze boosts Typhlosion's secondary Fire-type STAB attack to insane levels in late-game scenarios, becoming about as strong as full-power Eruption.</p> <p>As a powerful wallbreaker, Typhlosion naturally benefits special cleaners such as Jolteon and Farigiraf that appreciate special walls getting weakened.

Typhlosion appreciates VoltTurn support that can force in walls to get nuked by it, such as Articuno, Lanturn, Qwilfish, and Mesprit as well as the aforementioned Jolteon and Rotom-C. Typhlosion has trouble breaking through Fire-resistant Pokemon, including Snorlax, Lanturn, and Appletun, which makes counters to these threats such as Orthworm and Articuno attractive. Entry hazard removal is also appreciated from Pokemon such as Sandslash and Hitmonlee to keep Typhlosion at full health as long as possible. Healing Wish Pokemon like Shaymin and Mesprit can give Typhlosion a second chance at full health Eruptions later in the match.

Fast Pokemon like Jolteon, Grafaiai, and Choice Scarf Mesprit don't require much chip damage before they're at risk of being KOed by Eruption. Fire Blast lets Typhlosion keep up a good damage output once Eruption is no longer at maximum power, and it still threatens to OHKO foes like Sneasel, Virizion, and Whimsicott. Focus Blast 2HKOes Fire-resistant Pokemon like Regirock and Naclstack, and it is Typhlosion's strongest coverage move against Porygon2 and Snorlax. Scorching Sands covers Fire-types like Pyroar and opposing Typhlosion, wears down Lanturn, has greater accuracy against Rock-types, and can spread burns with a little bit of luck. Tera Fire enables Typhlosion to OHKO Choice Scarf Mesprit with Eruption after Stealth Rock damage. Flash Fire powers up Typhlosion's STAB moves to make it an even more dangerous cleaner if it can switch in on a Fire-type move from Charizard, opposing Choice-locked Typhlosion, or Will-O-Wisp from Weezing and Spiritomb, although Typhlosion often doesn't switch into most Pokemon if it wants to preserve the power of Eruption.

Special wallbreakers like Nasty Plot Mesprit, Choice Specs Jolteon, and Alolan Exeggutor can soften up or remove special sponges like Snorlax, Porygon2, and Hisuian Qwilfish for Typhlosion to more easily clean up. Snorlax is a very common special sponge that comfortably walls Typhlosion, so Typhlosion benefits from teammates that check Snorlax like Regirock, Passimian, and Orthworm. Chip damage from hazards wears down common checks to Typhlosion such as Regirock, Snorlax, and Naclstack, making hazard setters like both Qwilfish formes and Orthworm excellent support for Typhlosion. Healing Wish support from Mesprit and Shaymin can give Typhlosion another opportunity to melt down targets with Eruption. Typhlosion appreciates pivots bringing it in safely, especially on their checks, such as Mesprit with Orthworm and Articuno and Jolteon with Shaymin and Magneton. Lanturn and Magneton are especially good pivots to partner with Typhlosion, as they give it opportunities to threaten Grass-types they invite in like Rotom-C and Virizion.

Lanturn could use Thunder Wave for more reliable paralysis spreading, but it cannot make room for Thunder Wave without its moveset leaving it extremely passive. Leftovers is an alternative to Heavy-Duty Boots to extend Lanturn's longevity and make it less dependent on Rest for recovery, opening up options for different moves; Protect synergizes with Leftovers and allows Lanturn to scout attacks from Choice item users like Typhlosion and Mesprit, and Ice Beam leaves Lanturn less passive against Whimsicott and Dipplin. However, Lanturn will be more easily worn down by entry hazards as a pivot without Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Lanturn's defensive coverage limits it from dealing significant damage to Grass-types, most of which threaten it super effectively. Rotom-C is especially dangerous as a Volt Switch pivot that has a super effective secondary STAB move against Lanturn. Nasty Plot Rotom-C, Virizion, and Dipplin can use Lanturn as a chance to set up, though they should be wary of potential status. Brute Bonnet and Whimsicott can use Lanturn as an opportunity to switch in, but they're also challenged by status; Brute Bonnet especially dislikes burns, while Whimsicott is particularly hindered by paralysis. Slow and specially offensive Pokemon such as Alolan Exeggutor, Appletun, and Arboliva are the least impaired by Lanturn's status spreading. Shaymin can annoy Lanturn repeatedly and rely on Natural Cure to clear any status it takes from Lanturn.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Lanturn's passivity means it often doesn't do much other than threaten to status specially defensive Pokemon, though many cannot prevent it from pivoting out. If Porygon2 gains the right ability with Trace, it can prevent Lanturn from pivoting depending on which pivot move it runs. Curse Snorlax can use Lanturn as a chance to set up, though burns will force Snorlax to become more passive through Rest. Frosmoth can use Substitute to safely set up on Lanturn, and it's greatly enabled if Lanturn is forced to Rest.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: A Ground weakness can leave Lanturn offensively overwhelmed by Sandslash in spite of its bulk. Ground-types like Palossand and Sandaconda can beat Lanturn one-on-one if it lacks Scald, but they can't absorb its Flip Turn. Choice Specs Typhlosion can 3HKO Lanturn with Scorching Sands, but it will almost never switch into Lanturn.

Flip Turn is a slightly weaker pivoting option with the trade-off of working against Jolteon, opposing Lanturn with Volt Absorb, and Ground-types like Sandaconda and Palossand. Scald should always be run alongside Volt Switch; Lanturn uses it to threaten Pokemon that would block Volt Switch and burn physical attackers such as Brute Bonnet and Virizion that might try to switch in. Discharge pairs with Flip Turn and has the added benefit of spreading paralysis to punish setup sweepers and faster Pokemon such as Oricorio-F, Whimsicott, and Mesprit. Lanturn appreciates Discharge not forcing it to switch out when attacking Pokemon weak to Electric such as Poliwrath and Braviary. Rest is Lanturn's best method of recovery, and Sleep Talk helps Lanturn be less passive while it's asleep. Heavy-Duty Boots is especially helpful, as Lanturn pivots in frequently. Volt Absorb lets Lanturn reliably answer Electric-types such as Jolteon, Magneton, and Vikavolt. Water Absorb is an option for Lanturn to thwart Water-type attacks from Qwilfish and Floatzel, but Lanturn answers fewer specially offensive Water-types beyond Clawitzer compared to Electric-types.

A specially defensive EV spread lets Lanturn reliably answer strong special attackers like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Clawitzer.</p> <p>Many other pivots form great cores with Lanturn thanks to the momentum they provide for teams. Mesprit covers Lanturn's Ground weakness with Levitate and threatens Virizion. Grafaiai and Qwilfish can offensively threaten Grass-types with their Poison-type STAB moves, and they appreciate Lanturn taking on Jolteon and Magneton. Whimsicott can threaten Grass-types like Brute Bonnet, Dipplin, and Virizion as well as Ground-types like Sandaconda and Palossand. Virizion scares out Ground-types and threatens bulky Normal-types like Porygon2 and Snorlax. Other Poison-types like Hisuian Qwilfish and Weezing can check problematic Grass-types like Brute Bonnet and Virizion, and they benefit from Lanturn bringing them in safely while wearing down these targets. Strong wallbreakers like Typhlosion, Glastrier, and Brute Bonnet gain more opportunities to tear open holes in foes thanks to Lanturn's pivoting. Lanturn inviting in specially bulky Normal-type Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Snorlax can benefit Fighting-type partners such as Virizion and Hitmonlee. Lanturn is especially appreciative of partners like Charizard, Oricorio-F, and Sneasel that threaten Grass-types that would pressure it, and it can return the favor by checking Electric-types for Charizard and Oricorio-F and Fire-types for Sneasel. Fire-weak Pokemon like Whimsicott and Orthworm especially benefit from Lanturn as a stopgap to Charizard and Typhlosion, and they match Lanturn's help by defensively answering Ground-types like Sandaconda and Sandslash. Water-types like Floatzel and opposing Lanturn are a pain for Typhlosion and Charizard, so they can depend on Lanturn to handle these troublesome Pokemon for them, especially if Lanturn runs Water Absorb to deny Flip Turn from Floatzel and Qwilfish.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Qwilfish can Terastallize into a Ghost-type to block Rapid Spin attempts, but this makes it significantly weaker against Pokémon like Mismagius and Hisuian Qwilfish. Defensive Qwilfish sets can run Leftovers to heal gradually throughout a game, but this recovery is often mitigated by having to switch into entry hazards multiple times per game. Qwilfish can strengthen its offensive potential by equipping a Choice Band, unleashing strong Aqua Jets and Flip Turns while still switching into a variety of physical attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Strong Psychic-type attackers in ZU, including Mesprit, Veluza, and Indeedee-F, can threaten to outspeed and knock out Qwilfish. While these Pokemon don't love switching in against Qwilfish, they can afford to take a hit and deal massive damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Although their low bulk makes them struggle to switch into Qwilfish's attacks, Electric-type pivots like Rotom and Morpeko can outspeed and threaten an OHKO on Qwilfish. This can sometimes force opponents to use Terastallization on Qwilfish, limiting their offensive resources late-game. There additionally are Electric-type attackers with strong defensive profiles, such as Magneton and Vikavolt, that can switch into Qwilfish effectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type coverage</strong>: Qwilfish's Water-type STAB attacks may threaten out many Ground-types, but strong Ground-type attackers like Sandaconda, Palossand, and Sandslash can retaliate with super effective damage of their own. Many wallbreakers also pack Ground-type attacks that can heavily chip a Qwilfish looking to switch in, including Passimian, Glastrier, and Charizard.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to its lack of Special Defense, Qwilfish struggles to handle hits from special wallbreakers like Rotom, Mismagius, and Clawitzer. On the other hand, setup sweepers like Farigiraf and Mesprit can set up in its face if it lacks Taunt, although they don't enjoy getting poisoned or paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: While Qwilfish can feel like a defensive stalwart, its lack of reliable recovery makes it especially prone to Stealth Rock and Spikes. If setters like Palossand, Orthworm, and Regirock can keep hazards on the field, Qwilfish can later get overwhelmed by wallbreakers it would normally check efficiently.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>As a result of its defensive profile synergizing well with its threatening attacks and serviceable Speed tier, Qwilfish is an incredibly versatile Choice Scarf user that can surprise opponents expecting a defensive set. Choice Scarf Qwilfish provides both offensive and defensive value, revenge killing weakened foes while using Intimidate to switch into attackers in a pinch. Gunk Shot sets Qwilfish apart from other Water-type attackers, letting it dismantle Grass-types like Dipplin, Alolan Exeggutor, and Virizion. Liquidation is a similarly powerful STAB attack that helps it revenge kill weakened foes like Grafaiai and Sneasel. Flip Turn lets Qwilfish quickly pivot into a partner that can better handle walls like Orthworm and Weezing that switch into it. These forced switches also provide Qwilfish with the opportunity to lay down Spikes, allowing it to bluff a defensive set on certain occasions only for it to surprise the opponent with a revenge kill later on in the game. Barb Barrage is an alternative fourth move, being a more reliably accurate Poison-type attack that can also poison and thus wear down switch-ins like Regirock and Poliwrath. Lastly, Destiny Bond trades KOs with boosted threats like Braviary and Glastrier to prevent sweeps.</p> <p>Offense teams that need a combination of an offensive and defensive presence love the versatility provided by Qwilfish. Being able to finish off weakened Pokemon synergizes well with wallbreakers that specialize in dealing heavier damage, including Whimsicott, Magneton, and Glastrier. Finishing off foes assists setup sweepers like Oricorio-F, Sneasel, and Virizion. Qwilfish's defensive utility means that it can still switch into wallbreakers like Hisuian Sneasel and can support extremely frail pivots like Jolteon, Rotom, and Grafaiai. While it primarily focuses on revenge killing, Qwilfish's pivoting with Flip Turn can result in lots of chip damage in tandem with entry hazards set up by Orthworm, Sandslash, or Mesprit. The latter two Pokemon, alongside other Knock Off users like Sneasel and Passimian, can remove Heavy-Duty Boots to ensure hazards help chip down foes. More defensively oriented teams also feature walls like Articuno and Snorlax that greatly appreciate Flip Turn switching them in. Ghost-types like Palossand and Sableye can block Rapid Spin from Sandslash and Hitmonlee.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Despite competition from other Swords Dance users in the tier, Qwilfish can still consistently set up to sweep thanks to its defensive typing and access to Intimidate. Qwilfish can turn the tables on would-be checks like Orthworm and Regirock by setting up Swords Dance in front of them. Liquidation and Gunk Shot are two powerful STAB moves that take out walls like Sandaconda, Snorlax, and Dipplin. Aqua Jet allows it to get the jump on faster foes like Sneasel, Jolteon, and Charizard, typically grabbing a KO after a boost and enough chip damage. This also makes Qwilfish an apt revenge killer, with Tera Water making Aqua Jet even stronger after a Swords Dance boost. Leftovers supports Qwilfish on top of its already great ability and typing, granting it significantly more staying power than other setup sweepers.</p> <p>Swords Dance Qwilfish provides a bulky dynamic to offensive teams looking to overwhelm foes with a variety of strong attacks. Pivots like Articuno, Mesprit, and Rotom can effectively bring in Qwilfish while also chipping walls like Regirock and Porygon2. Other wallbreakers like Glastrier, Grafaiai, and Whimsicott can chip down the opposing team to make its sweep easier. A more aggressive team with several sweepers like Virizion, Sneasel, and Oricorio-F can let Qwilfish help overwhelm opposing teams. More balanced teams can also effectively use Swords Dance Qwilfish as a way to surprise opponents expecting a more defensive set. Since Qwilfish is purely invested in its offense, it's still important to support Qwilfish with a strong defensive backbone including walls such as Snorlax, Dipplin, and Sandslash. Entry hazard setters like Sandaconda, Palossand, and Orthworm also chip down foes over the course of a longer game, possibly giving Qwilfish the chance to OHKO Snorlax after a boost.</p>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>As one of the most splashable Pokemon in ZU, Qwilfish threatens to deter physical wallbreakers with Intimidate, making it a premier Spikes setter with the longevity to set multiple layers up. Furthermore, by Terastallizing into a Ground-type, Qwilfish can surprise Electric-type foes, including Rotom and Jolteon. Flip Turn hits prominent Pokemon like Sandaconda, Oricorio-F, and Palossand for super effective damage while allowing a teammate to switch in. Barb Barrage may hit Pokemon such as Lurantis and Virizion for super effective damage, but switch-ins also dislike this move due to the poison chance. It can run a variety of moves for its fourth moveslot, but Taunt's capability of shutting down utility moves such as Recover and Defog make it the most preferable. Nevertheless, Pain Split is a valid alternative if one wants a semi-recovery option to increase its longevity, which is especially valuable against foes with high HP like Snorlax and Lanturn. Toxic and Thunder Wave are also good options to more reliably inflict status. Rocky Helmet's chip damage makes Qwilfish a fantastic punisher of spammable contact moves like U-turn and Knock Off, but Heavy-Duty Boots greatly helps Qwilfish's longevity.</p> <p>Qwilfish's versatility makes it a seamless fit onto many team styles, but balance and bulky offense teams especially love its entry hazard setting and defensive pivoting. By chipping down foes with its STAB combination while laying down layers of Spikes, late-game cleaners like Passimian and Mesprit can more easily take down worn out opponents. These threats also boast the ability to pivot, creating VoltTurn cores that bolster offensive pressure. By pivoting with Flip Turn, Qwilfish can safely bring in frail attackers like Jolteon, Dodrio, and Typhlosion, which can all wreak havoc when they're given the chance to enter the field healthy. Ghost-types like Spiritomb and Mismagius are especially nice partners, since they provide an immunity to Rapid Spin to keep Spikes on the field. Grass-types like Brute Bonnet, Virizion, and Whimsicott also provide type synergy with Qwilfish, as their offensive and defensive strengths are bolstered by Qwilfish's overall utility. Qwilfish's defensive profile also makes life easier for bulky partners like Snorlax and Articuno, as Qwilfish can switch into threatening Fighting-types like Passimian, Virizion, and Hitmontop. In return, those walls can more easily take on the special attacks that may scare Qwilfish out. Other defensive Pokemon like Sandaconda and Palossand can reinforce a team's physical backbone while also being immune to Volt Switch users that threaten to OHKO Qwilfish.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Hisuian Qwilfish is a versatile Pokemon in SV ZU thanks to its great movepool and unique defensive traits. Hisuian Qwilfish is an excellent check to threats like Mesprit, Virizion, and Mismagius thanks to its defensive typing and solid bulk backed by Eviolite. Intimidate and few weaknesses make it a blanket answer to threats like Grafaiai, Whimsicott, and Brute Bonnet. Hisuian Qwilfish's good defensive profile creates many opportunities for utility sets to set Spikes against common Pokemon such as Mesprit, Brute Bonnet, and Whimsicott. Its setup opportunities against common Pokemon also apply for offensive sets with Swords Dance, which threaten to sweep faster Pokemon like Charizard and Typhlosion thanks to Aqua Jet as they break defensive cores that depend on Grass-types like Dipplin and Arboliva. However, Hisuian Qwilfish is held back by its lack of longevity paired with its middling natural bulk, making it dependent on its Eviolite, and its Ground weakness leaves it vulnerable to Sandaconda and Sandslash as well as coverage moves from Passimian and Charizard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish can use Scale Shot to boost its Speed to evade revenge killing attempts by faster Pokemon like Jolteon, Whimsicott, and Choice Scarf Passimian, but Aqua Jet doesn't require an additional turn of setup. Poison Point doesn't activate Defiant on Passimian and Braviary and can punish U-turn users like Mesprit and Whimsicott, but Intimidate offers more general and reliable defensive utility against physical attackers. Agility can be used on Swords Dance sets to make Hisuian Qwilfish less reliant on Aqua Jet but requires it to spend additional turns setting up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Sandaconda is difficult for Hisuian Qwilfish to beat outright, and Sandslash can remove any entry hazards it sets. Although Palossand is weak to Hisuian Qwilfish's Crunch, it can wall the utility set barring Defense drops and wear it down with Scorching Sands. However, Sandslash can be worn down by repeated hits, and Palossand can be worn down by chip damage from poison or overwhelmed if Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish has boosted. Ground-type STAB moves from these Pokemon as well as Ground-type coverage from Passimian can efficiently dispatch Hisuian Qwilfish.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Orthworm is immovable to Hisuian Qwilfish and can use it to set up its own entry hazards, Coil, or Iron Defense. Regirock dislikes Toxic, but it can wall Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish or use Tera to deny Toxic while chipping away at Hisuian Qwilfish with Body Press. Weezing is immune to Toxic and can burn Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Magneton takes little to no damage from utility Hisuian Qwilfish's moves and can use it to come in and fire off powerful attacks. Typhlosion, Clawitzer, and Alolan Exeggutor deal immense damage to Hisuian Qwilfish, but they must be mindful of their health to avoid being finished off by the Swords Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Glastrier and Floatzel threaten to cut through Hisuian Qwilfish's underwhelming bulk, especially if they've been unaffected by Intimidate. Sneasel is unaffected by Intimidate, and Passimian is even strengthened by it. However, several of these Pokemon do not enjoy switching into Barb Barrage. Hisuian Sneasel notably resists Hisuian Qwilfish's STAB combination and can easily use the specially defensive set as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hisuian Qwilifsh lacks recovery, so entry hazards from opposing setters like Orthworm, Regirock, and Qwilfish can quickly wear it down. Burns spread by Charizard and Palossand chip away at Hisuian Qwilfish and make it far more passive, and Swords Dance sets are especially cramped by them.</p>",

Thanks to its typing, Hisuian Qwilfish can check specially offensive setup sweepers like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Mismagius thanks to its immunity to Stored Power and lack of weaknesses to common special coverage moves like Draining Kiss and Dazzling Gleam. Barb Barrage is a great STAB move for Hisuian Qwilfish, as it wears down Pokemon with its high chance to poison and powers up when its targets are poisoned, and walls like Regirock and Palossand do not appreciate being poisoned. Barb Barrage is great against the Grass-types Hisuian Qwilfish checks, such as Virizion and Dipplin, as well as Fairy-type Pokemon like Whimsicott and Tera Fairy Mesprit and Mismagius. Crunch is a stronger STAB move for foes that aren't yet poisoned and has great coverage against other specially offensive threats like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Mismagius. Hisuian Qwilfish's excellent defensive profile gives it plenty of opportunities to set up Spikes as it threatens out Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Dipplin. Toxic more reliably statuses foes compared to Barb Barrage, and Toxic poison is deadlier to walls like Porygon2, Regirock, and Palossand. Taunt lets Hisuian Qwilfish shut down opposing defensive Pokemon like Porygon2, Orthworm, and Weezing to prevent them from recovering or supporting their teams. Haze removes boosts from specially offensive setup sweepers that Hisuian Qwilfish checks, such as Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Virizion. Intimidate lets Hisuian Qwilfish work as a stopgap to physical attackers like Grafaiai, Swords Dance Virizion, and Swords Dance Qwilfish. Tera Dragon lends Hisuian Qwilfish new resistances to Electric and Fire to make it a better check to special attackers like Rotom-C and Typhlosion.</p> <p>Hisuian Qwilfish fits on bulky offensive teams looking to compress a solid defensive backbone and entry hazard setter into one slot. Offensive Pokemon like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Jolteon are great beneficiaries of Spikes set by Hisuian Qwilfish, as common checks to them like Snorlax and Regirock are prone to being overwhelmed by residual damage. Roar Articuno and Dragon Tail Dipplin can put Spikes set by Hisuian Qwilfish to good use by quickly racking up residual damage. Sandslash's Earthquake and Rapid Spin are very threatening to Hisuian Qwilfish, so good checks to Sandslash like Virizion, Dipplin, and Orthworm help Hisuian Qwilfish, and Palossand can spinblock for Hisuian Qwilfish as a bonus. Grass-types in particular, such as Whimsicott, Virizion, and Shaymin, make great partners for Hisuian Qwilfish by covering its sole weakness to Ground. Hisuian Qwilfish can struggle against specially offensive foes like Jolteon, Typhlosion, and Charizard, so special walls like Snorlax, Regirock, and Porygon2 can help deal with these foes while appreciating the residual damage that Hisuian Qwilfish spreads. Several physical attackers like Hisuian Sneasel and Sneasel ignore Intimidate while others like Passimian and Braviary can benefit from it, so physical sponges like Dipplin, Regirock, Palossand, and Sandaconda cover these foes for Hisuian Qwilfish. Teammates such as Passimian, Hisuian Avalugg, and Regirock appreciate Hisuian Qwilfish for checking special attackers like Mesprit, Mismagius, and Farigiraf for them.</p>"

Aqua Jet's coverage is especially threatening to Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion and makes Hisuian Qwilfish a helpful revenge killer for them. Intimidate increases Hisuian Qwilfish's setup opportunities against physical attackers it neutralizes such as Snorlax, Qwilfish, and Virizion. Tera Water powers up Aqua Jet for more efficient cleaning, mitigates Ground-type attacks from the likes of Passimian and Sandaconda, and gives Hisuian Qwilfish a more comfortable defensive typing against Floatzel and Qwilfish.</p> <p>Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish works well on offense teams as a sweeper capable of taking advantage of common Pokemon like Mesprit and Grafaiai to set up, and its immunity to Prankster Encore moves from Grafaiai and Whimsicott is a great asset to these teams; it can also fit on balance teams as a wallbreaker. Wallbreakers like Typhlosion, Magneton, and Floatzel can soften up teams for Hisuian Qwilfish to more easily clean up. Hisuian Qwilfish's Ground weakness means it benefits from teammates like Whimsicott, Virizion, and Glastrier that threaten Ground-types like Sandaconda, Palossand, and Sandslash. More defenisve partners like Orthworm, Articuno, and Dipplin can also handle the aforementioned Ground-types. Dipplin can also absorb Knock Off and Trick for Hisuian Qwilfish, which it appreciates given its dependence on Eviolite for its bulk.

STAB Knock Off makes Sneasel excellent at forcing progress, especially since the primary Knock Off absorber, Dipplin, fears its Ice-type attacks, and it outruns many already fast threats like Charizard, Mismagius, and Grafaiai. However, Sneasel's paper-thin defenses mean it crumples to most strong neutral attacks and, combined with its many weaknesses, give it near to no defensive utility outside of switching into Psychic-type attacks. Sneasel also can be left wanting in power and struggles to break past walls like Regirock and Orthworm. Choice Band sets don't have this problem but are vulnerable to entry hazards and very prediction reliant. Lastly, Sneasel is incredibly vulnerable to getting revenge killed by most Choice Scarf users in the tier, like Passimian, Grafaiai, and Typhlosion, as well as priority attacks such as Mach Punch from Hitmontop.</p>",

All of Floatzel, Grafaiai, Passimian, and Mesprit can revenge kill Sneasel with ease.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon like Regirock, Orthworm, and Weezing don't fear much from Sneasel and can force it out with status conditions or super effective attacks. However, since all three of them lack reliable recovery, and the former two hate losing Leftovers, Sneasel can slowly wear them down over a longer game. Avalugg and Glastrier also can take Sneasel on but hate losing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Snorlax can take a Knock Off well enough but doesn't appreciate losing its Leftovers either.

Heavy-Duty Boots lets Sneasel come in without taking damage from entry hazards, allowing it to come in many times over the course of a game. Tera Ice boosts Triple Axel and Ice Shard's power immensely, netting a 2HKO on Regirock and Weezing at +2, but does nothing to help Sneasel's terrible defensive typing. Tera Ghost flips Sneasel's Fighting weakness into an immunity, letting it blank Close Combat from revenge killers like Choice Scarf Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel, but it also makes Sneasel weak to Sucker Punch from Brute Bonnet.</p> <p>Sneasel's powerful Knock Off makes it an excellent pick on entry hazard stacking teams where teammates such as Qwilfish, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Orthworm help Sneasel push past bulkier foes like Magneton and Snorlax. Sneasel struggles to break past physically bulky foes like Regirock, Orthworm, and Weezing, so teammates that share these checks like Charizard, Mesprit, and Virizion, respectively, can team up to wear down said walls. Poliwrath notably takes little damage from Sneasel's STAB attacks, so teammates that handle it like Whimsicott and Shaymin are quite helpful. Physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Floatzel and Brute Bonnet also help wear walls down so Sneasel can sweep. Fighting-types like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel threaten Sneasel immensely, so defensive fallbacks like Weezing and Palossand make for great teammates. Other defensive teammates such as Porygon2 and Poliwrath help make up for Sneasel's lack of defenses, dealing with threats like Whimsicott, Typhlosion, and Floatzel for it. As Sneasel struggles to switch in directly, pivots like Jolteon, Passimian, Whimsicott, and Lanturn are all helpful in assisting Sneasel to hit the field safely.

Low Kick is Sneasel's strongest move against physically bulky Pokemon like Glastrier, Regirock, Hisuian Avalugg, and Orthworm, which take neutral or resisted damage from its STAB moves, but its limited coverage and variable power make it a difficult option to lock into. Inner Focus is helpful for blocking Intimidate from Qwilfish and Hisuian Qwilfish.

Choice Band Sneasel's ability to lure in and remove Leftovers from Regirock makes it a great enabler to offensive Pokemon that struggle against it such as Charizard, Snorlax, and Oricorio-F, and it functions similarly against Orthworm to support Mesprit, Whimsicott, and Grafaiai. Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes creates excellent synergy with entry hazard setting Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Orthworm. Choice Band Sneasel is vulnerable to being worn down by entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, so hazard removers like Sandslash, Hisuian Avalugg, and Lurantis are critical to maximizing Sneasel's offensive presence. Defensive pivots like Lanturn, Mesprit, and Qwilfish can bring Sneasel in safely in spite of its poor bulk and vulnerable defensive typing. While Sneasel resists Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch from foes like Muk and Brute Bonnet, its frailty leaves it prone to strong and super effective priority users; Sandaconda, Palossand, and Weezing can check Passimian for Sneasel, and Qwilfish, Lanturn, and Poliwrath can check Floatzel.

A more offensively inclined set with Download and Agility is similarly enticing, but the inconsistency of Download to get the correct boost and Porygon2's weaker STAB attack make it a poor sweeper compared to Farigiraf, Jolteon, and Oricorio-F.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Virizion, Passimian, and Hitmonlee all threaten Porygon2 with their powerful physical Fighting-type STAB moves, though only Virizion can mitigate Porygon2's Thunder Wave by holding a Lum Berry. Hitmonlee's Limber means it isn't deterred by Thunder Wave. Regirock and Orthworm slam Porygon2 with Body Press and can use its passivity as their chance to set entry hazards or use Iron Defense to further power up Body Press. Glastrier can use Close Combat to KO Porygon2 after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo</strong>: Porygon2 depends on Eviolite for its substantial bulk and should be wary of Pokemon that use item disruption tactics; Mesprit. Grafaiai, Sneasel, and Sandslash commonly run Knock Off and may soften up Porygon2 for their teammates if they can't break through it on their own. A Choice item from Whimsicott, Mismagius, and Rotom can enable these special attackers or their teammates to exploit or overwhelm Porygon2.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards take a toll on Porygon2's longevity and force it to become more passive by using Recover more often. The constant chip damage from Toxic Spikes from the Qwilfish formes and Weezing are especially noxious to Porygon2. Toxic from the Qwilfish formes and Spiritomb directly puts Porygon2 on a timer to make it less effective as a wall. Poison Touch poisons from Grafaiai and even Will-O-Wisp from Charizard wear on Porygon2's health.</p> <p><strong>Substitute and Taunt Users</strong>: Mesprit can use Terastallization, Encore, and Substitute to turn Porygon2 into setup fodder for itself. Mismagius may overwhelm Porygon2 with a mix of Terastallization, Taunt or Substitute, and setup.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Porygon2's excellent bulk thanks to Eviolite, reliable recovery, and few weaknesses make it an excellent defensive answer to special attackers like Charizard and Magneton. Thunder Wave lets Porygon2 slow down Speed-boosting setup sweepers like Oricorio-F and Farigiraf while punishing switch-ins like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel. Tri Attack lets Porygon2 spread status as it attacks and can discourages walls like Regirock and Hisuian Qwilfish from switching in. Ice Beam targets Pokemon weak to Ice like Virizion and Brute Bonnet, notably enabling Porygon2 to 2HKO defensive Ground-types like Sandslash and Palossand. Trace gives Porygon2 added defensive utility against Pokemon like Jolteon, Flash Fire Typhlosion, and Oricorio-F by copying their immunity abilities or Dancer. Trace also copies abilities that defensively augment Porygon2, such as Sticky Hold from Dipplin, Prankster from Grafaiai and Whimsicott, and Pressure from Articuno. Tera Fairy removes Porygon2's Fighting weakness to lessen its vulnerability to coverage moves from special wallbreakers such as Typhlosion and Clawitzer, and it can turn the tables on Fighting-type Pokemon that would otherwise break through Porygon2, such as Passimian and Virizion.</p> <p>Porygon2 is a capable backbone for bulky teams thanks to its longevity and single Fighting weakness. Physically defensive Pokemon like Palossand, Orthworm, and Sandaconda can form defensive cores with Porygon2, and they especially appreciate it as a check to special attackers that threaten them like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Magneton. Fighting-types like Hisuian Sneasel, Passimian, and Virizion threaten Porygon2, so it relies on checks to these Pokemon such as Weezing, Palossand, and Charizard. Porygon2 depends on its Eviolite for its bulk, so it is greatly appreciative of Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off such as Dipplin and Muk, providing Dipplin an answer to special attackers and Muk a check to Psychic-types in return. Braviary, Hisuian Avalugg, and Sandslash all maximize Porygon2's longevity by removing entry hazards that would otherwise wear it down. Porygon2 appreciates reliable answers to Nasty Plot Mesprit, such as Magneton and Hisuian Qwilfish. Pivots such as Magneton and Mesprit can make Porygon2 get stuck in a loop of switching in, taking chip damage from entry hazards and pivot moves, and needing to switch out against a strong wallbreaker like Brute Bonnet; Porygon2 benefits from partners that can break said cycle, such as Braviary with its hazard removal.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On paper, Sturdy gives a healthy Regirock a guaranteed turn to set up Stealth Rock, but between Regirock being so bulky and entry hazards being ubiquitous, it's unlikely that Regirock would be at risk of being OHKOed from full HP outside of uncommonly strong hits like Clawitzer's Water Pulse or Alolan Exeggutor's Leaf Storm. Regirock is totally dependent on the passive recovery from Leftovers to be a reliable wall, so even items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Rocky Helmet are suboptimal. Stone Edge is generally stronger than Rock Blast but has unreliable accuracy and poor PP, and it and Rock Slide cannot break past Substitute Pokemon. Curse can be used as a setup move over Iron Defense to power up Regirock's Rock Blast, but the extra Defense from Iron Defense is more useful to stonewall physical attackers, and Regirock's Body Press is more powerful and reliable than its STAB move anyway. Protect can enhance Regirock's recovery from Leftovers and allow Regirock to scout common Choice item attackers like Jolteon, Whimsicott, and Floatzel but it makes Regirock much more passive. Tera Ghost lets Regirock become immune to Fighting-type moves from major offensive threats like Hitmonlee, Virizion, and Passimian while preserving Regirock's ability to check Snorlax and enabling it to block Rapid Spin from Sandslash and Toedscruel. Tera Grass helps Regirock manage its common Grass, Water, and Ground weaknesses, whereas Tera Water lets Regirock better handle Glastrier, and Tera Steel shares Tera Poison's poison immunity and Grass resistance while giving Regirock an easier time against Mesprit and Farigiraf. Regirock can run a Careful nature to patch up its relatively lower special bulk, but Regirock is often tasked with taking on physical attackers, and more Defense investment benefits its IronPress combination.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Palossand counters Regirock and uses it as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, recover with Shore Up, or threaten Regirock and its teammates with burns from Scorching Sands. Sandaconda has great longevity, while Sandslash and Toedscruel can remove Regirock's entry hazards with Rapid Spin, but all three must be wary of Regirock boosting too much with Iron Defense.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Regirock's lower special bulk leaves it prone to being overwhelmed by special attackers like Mesprit, Jolteon, and Rotom. Magneton can hit Regirock super effectively with its STAB Flash Cannon. However, most special attackers are physically frail, and Magneton takes a lot of damage from Regirock's Body Press. Many special attackers also cannot KO Regirock without significant chip or several boosts.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Regirock's Fighting weakness can lead it to fall victim to Fighting-types like Hitmonlee, Passimian, and Virizion. Hitmontop, Hitmonlee, and Hitmonchan can all remove Regirock's Stealth Rock. However, Regirock can turn the tables on physically offensive Fighting-types with its IronPress combination and Terastallization.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Whimsicott, Alolan Exeggutor, and Sceptile can blow through Regirock with their strong super effective STAB moves, and Whimsicott is distinguished for avoiding a 2HKO from Regirock's Body Press after Stealth Rock. Alolan Exeggutor annihilates Regirock, while Dipplin can phaze Regirock with Dragon Tail and use Recover to wall it back.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Swords Dance Qwilfish and Veluza both Body Press and can rely on their Water-type STAB moves to break through Regirock. Clawitzer can OHKO Regirock with Water Pulse but cannot switch into Regirock's Body Press more than once with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo</strong>: Regirock relies on its Leftovers for recovery, so Knock Off users like Sneasel, Mesprit, and Grafaiai are disruptive to Regirock. Mespirit and Hisuian Sneasel can use Trick and Switcheroo to disrupt Regirock by giving it their Choice items.</p> <p><strong>Residual damage</strong>: Burns and poison neutralize Regirock's already limited passive recovery. Burns from Will-O-Wisp users like Weezing and Rotom halve Regirock's damage output, while Toxic from Qwilfish formes, Muk, and Toedscruel puts Regirock on a timer. Entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes cause Regirock to struggle to stay healthy.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Encore users like Whimsicott and Grafaiai can lock Regirock into a move to exploit it though neither enjoy taking Body Press. Qwilfish and Primeape can use Taunt to stop Regirock from setting up Stealth Rock or Iron Defense. Sableye can run Taunt or Encore and does not fear Regirock's Body Press.</p>",

Body Press crushes Normal-types like Snorlax and Porygon2, Ice-types like Glastrier and Sneasel, and Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton. Iron Defense boosts Regirock's physical bulk and powers up Body Press, turning Regirock into a bulky setup sweeper capable of suffocating physical attackers like Snorlax and overwhelming walls like Sandaconda. Thunder Wave slows down setup sweepers like Hisuian Sneasel and fast Pokemon like Whimsicott but makes Regirock more passive. Clear Body helpfully denies stat debuffs from Intimidate, Shadow Ball, and Triple Arrows. 16 Defense EVs and an Impish nature is a useful jump point to balance Regirock's bulk. Tera Poison helps with Regirock's Grass and Fighting weaknesses and gives it an immunity to poison.</p> <p>Regirock fits best on teams looking for a physically defensive backbone that can set up Stealth Rock. While Regirock has great physical bulk, its typing and comparatively lesser special bulk leave it more prone to strong special attacks. Specially defensive partners like Snorlax, Articuno, and Hisuian Qwilfish complement Regirock's physical bulk and can intercept special attackers like Mismagius, Whimsicott, and Mesprit. Sandslash and Hitmontop can form entry hazard cores with Regirock and help keep it from taking entry hazard chip damage. Other Grass-type partners like Alolan Exeggutor, Dipplin, and Virizion are also appreciated by Regirock, as they can cover its Ground, Grass, and Water weaknesses by taking on Sandslash, opposing Dipplin, and Clawitzer, while Regirock can take on threatening Flying-types like Oricorio-F and Articuno.</p>"

  "Floatzel": {
    "overview": "<p>Floatzel is a dominant offensive threat thanks to its amazing Speed and powerful Wave Crash to wash away slower foes. Not only is Floatzel naturally fast, but it also has Aqua Jet to revenge kill otherwise faster Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf users like Mesprit and Passimian. Options like Flip Turn and Bulk Up enable Floatzel to run several sets, making it unpredictable on top of already being a dangerous revenge killer and cleaner in one. Coverage from Ice Spinner ensures that Floatzel isn't easily answered by Grass-types and Tera Dragon users. However, Floatzel's subpar bulk and tendency to wear itself down with Wave Crash recoil leave it unable to do more than take a single unresisted hit. While Floatzel is naturally very fast, it's still slower than Jolteon, Whimsicott, and Choice Scarf users, further magnifying the issue of its underwhelming bulk. Bulky Water-types like Qwilfish and Lanturn are enormous obstacles to Floatzel in any of its roles. Floatzel faces competition from other Water-types like the aforementioned Lanturn and Qwilfish thanks to the additional utility they bring.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Floatzel could run an offensive pivot set with Heavy-Duty Boots or Mystic Water, but giving up the power of Choice Band or the extra Speed from a Choice Scarf leaves it either too weak to break through teams or too slow in the face of Choice Scarf users and Jolteon. Choice Scarf Floatzel can run a Jolly nature to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai and Mismagius, but the loss of power leaves it less reliable as a revenge killer to fast Pokemon like Jolteon without prior damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Qwilfish can stomach repeated hits from Wave Crash thanks to Intimidate while adding to the punishment of recoil with Rocky Helmet, though it can't stop Floatzel from escaping with Flip Turn. Water Absorb Lanturn flatly counters Floatzel and prevents it from pivoting. Even if Lanturn lacks Water Absorb, Floatzel must take a significant amount of recoil damage and potentially exhaust Terastallization to break through it, while Lanturn threatens Floatzel back with Discharge or Volt Switch. Although it's less common, Poliwrath totally counters all of Floatzel's sets, blocks Flip Turn with Water Absorb, and can use Floatzel as setup fodder for Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ice Spinner threatens all Grass-types, but the prediction-reliant nature of Choice item sets can leave Floatzel vulnerable to Grass-types. Whimsicott naturally outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Floatzel, but its poor physical bulk means it's worn down by repeated hits from Flip Turn and even unable to tolerate multiple hits from Wave Crash. Bulkier Grass-types like Dipplin, Brute Bonnet, and Arboliva can tank even a Choice Band-boosted Ice Spinner and threaten to KO Floatzel with their Grass-type STAB moves. Shaymin has enough bulk to take one Choice Band-boosted Ice Spinner from Floatzel and proceed to threaten it back with Seed Flare; Choice Scarf Shaymin sets are also unbothered by Floatzel's Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Jolteon can easily revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Floatzel, and Floatzel requires prior damage on Jolteon to threaten it with a boosted Aqua Jet even if it exhausts Terastallization. Choice Scarf Electric-types like Rotom and Magneton can similarly revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Floatzel. Offensive pivot Magneton and Vikavolt can tank even a boosted Wave Crash from Floatzel and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Recoil and Entry Hazards</strong>: Floatzel is especially susceptible to being worn down by hazards and recoil. Qwilfish is particularly problematic given it can switch in and set up Spikes in front of Floatzel. Other Spikes setters, such as Orthworm, Sandslash, and Froslass, similarly contribute to Floatzel exhausting itself.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Nothing besides particularly fast Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai and Mismagius can outspeed Floatzel when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Flip Turn lets Floatzel keep up offensive momentum, luring in passive Pokemon like defensive Qwilfish and Lanturn for its teammates to exploit. Ice Spinner lets Floatzel pressure Dipplin and other Grass-types. Liquidation trades some of the great wallbreaking power of Wave Crash for not inflicting recoil damage on Floatzel, which can be useful when it can secure its KOs in spite of the lower damage. Aqua Jet is an alternative that serves as an emergency option against fast Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai, Mismagius, and Hisuian Sneasel. Aqua Jet also enables Floatzel to revenge kill speed-boosting sweepers like Oricorio formes if they've boosted multiple times, and it similarly helps Floatzel handle faster speed-boosting sweepers like Trailblaze Hisuian Sneasel. An Adamant nature maximizes Floatzel's power, reliably revenge killing Jolteon and OHKOing Grafaiai 93.8% of the time; it also leaves it fast enough to outspeed +1 base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Typhlosion and Shaymin. Tera Water boosts the power of Floatzel's STAB moves to cross KO thresholds it otherwise couldn't without more significant prior damage, making it especially useful against bulkier foes like Farigiraf and Passimian, potentially KOing either of them after damage from Spikes. Floatzel can also use Tera Water to more easily clean up weakened teams.</p> <p>Floatzel is an excellent choice for VoltTurn teams given its capacity to form pivot cores. Grafaiai and Floatzel form a complementary offensive pivot core where the two threaten each other's checks, such as Grafaiai pressuring Grass-types like Dipplin and Floatzel breaking through Regirock and Palossand; Floatzel can more easily clean up teams Grafaiai weakens with Knock Off and Poison Touch. Jolteon is a specially offensive pivot that can threaten physically defensive Pokemon like Qwilfish and Orthworm for Floatzel, and Floatzel can return the favor to it by threatening Ground-types like Sandaconda and Sandslash; the two of them can also wear down their mutual Grass-type checks, such as Shaymin and Dipplin, so they can overwhelm them with their coverage moves. Floatzel's offensive pivoting supports wallbreakers such as Brute Bonnet and Glastrier by bringing them in safely, and they additionally benefit from Floatzel threatening fast Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion. Magneton is an offensive pivot that also gains from Floatzel threatening fast Fire-types, and in return, it can fry problematic Water-types like Qwilfish and Poliwrath. Floatzel tends to be worn down quickly between recoil and damage from entry hazards, so teammates with hazard removal like Sandslash and Hitmontop provide helpful support. Hazard setters are important partners for Floatzel, as their entry hazards can chip down checks like Qwilfish and Dipplin. Water Absorb users like Lanturn and Poliwrath are a major problem, as they prevent Floatzel from wallbreaking and pivoting entirely, so it depends on Grass-type teammates like Virizion, Whimsicott, and Dipplin to deal with them.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Floatzel's great offensive STAB type and fantastic Speed make it a powerful pivot, wallbreaker, and revenge killer. Flip Turn lets Floatzel keep up momentum for its team while dealing chip damage and finishing off weakened foes. Aqua Jet lets Floatzel pick off faster Pokemon such as Jolteon and Choice Scarf Typhlosion and Speed-boosting setup sweepers like Oricorio-F and Hisuian Sneasel. Ice Spinner provides useful coverage against Grass-types like Virizion, Whimsicott, and Dipplin. Ice Spinner is also useful against Pokemon that may use Tera Dragon, such as Sandaconda, Palossand, and Hisuian Qwilfish. Water Veil provides Floatzel with a burn immunity, letting it switch into Will-O-Wisp from Charizard and Scorching Sands from Palossand. Tera Water lets Floatzel OHKO Regirock after damage from Spikes or Stealth Rock and pick off Jolteon with Aqua Jet at just 62.7% health.</p> <p>Floatzel's multiple offensive roles earn it niches on several different types of teams. Floatzel is an excellent addition to VoltTurn teams with Electric-type partners like Magneton and Jolteon, exerting constant offensive pressure and wearing down their shared Grass-type checks. Other offensive pivots like Passimian and Grafaiai similarly make great cores with Floatzel by keeping up constant offensive momentum. Defensive pivots like Lanturn and Articuno can give Floatzel opportunities to come in and fire off Choice Band-boosted attacks; Lanturn can check Electric-types for Floatzel, and Floatzel can return the favor by answering Ground-types for Lanturn; Articuno can impede special attackers such as Clawitzer and Whimsicott that resist Floatzel's Water-type moves and could hit it back with strong attacks. Floatzel's nearly unparalleled ability to revenge kill setup sweepers like Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Jolteon is a huge asset to more defensive teams. Floatzel struggles to break through Grass-types like Shaymin and Dipplin on its own, so it appreciates teammates like Charizard, Weezing, and Muk that threaten them. Glastrier menaces other Grass-types like Whimsicott and Dipplin that would give Floatzel trouble, and Floatzel can threaten Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion for it in return. Other powerful offensive Pokemon such as Glastrier and Brute Bonnet appreciate Floatzel bringing them in safely with Flip Turn. Floatzel tends to be worn down by Wave Crash's recoil and entry hazard damage, so it appreciates teammates that provide hazard removal, such as Hisuian Avalugg, Hitmontop, and Sandslash. Healing Wish users like Mesprit and Shaymin can give Floatzel a second wind to clean up the very teams it weakened. Qwilfish is a pain for Floatzel between Intimidate, chip damage from its Spikes, and Rocky Helmet damage; Floatzel appreciates checks to Qwilfish such as Rotom and Mesprit. Water Absorb Lanturn prevents Floatzel from pivoting out or spamming its STAB moves, so Floatzel relies on checks to it such as Virizion and Dipplin.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Bulk Up enables Floatzel to sweep teams, take advantage of its offensive flexibility, and take a hit after it sets up. Ice Spinner nails bulky Grass-types like Dipplin and Virizion. Aqua Jet lets Floatzel pick off faster revenge killers like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Mesprit. Leftovers gives Floatzel some longevity as it sets up, enabling it to overcome physically defensive Pokemon like Orthworm and Sandaconda without hemorrhaging all of its health. Water Veil prevents burns from Weezing and Palossand. Tera Water boosts Floatzel's Wave Crash to wash away slower Pokemon; Floatzel's +1 Tera Water-boosted Aqua Jet does at least 36% to Choice Scarf users like Mesprit and Passimian, preventing their revenge killing attempts.</p> <p>Floatzel fits well on offensive and balance teams alike thanks to its great offensive potential and high Speed. Offensive teams particularly appreciate Floatzel as a sweeper that can run over walls like Regirock and Palossand. Floatzel is an asset to balance teams with its natural speed control, and they can support it with defensive pivots such as Mesprit for an easier time setting up. Floatzel is generally a Choice item user, so the surprise of Bulk Up when it is positioned to claim a KO can swing a game in its favor. Entry hazards from setters like Hisuian Qwilfish, Orthworm, and Hisuian Avalugg can help Floatzel overwhelm bulkier foes like Dipplin. Floatzel struggles to break Lanturn and cannot break it at all if Lanturn has Water Absorb, which similarly applies to Poliwrath, so Grass-types like Whimsicott and Dipplin can handle these foes for Floatzel. Qwilfish is another annoying bulky Water-type to Floatzel, so Magneton and Mesprit make great partners by threatening it. Healing Wish users, including Mesprit and Shaymin, support Floatzel by giving it a second chance to sweep, which is especially useful when it takes recoil damage from Wave Crash or if it's been paralyzed. Opportunities for Floatzel to set up comfortably can be created by pivots like Jolteon, Passimian, and Vikavolt; Encore users like Grafaiai and Mesprit are especially good at making these advantageous situations for Floatzel. Whimsicott and Articuno are pivots that can lure in Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion for Floatzel. Floatzel has to fear faster Electric-type revenge killers like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton if they haven't been worn down into range of being KOed by Aqua Jet, so it depends on partners like Lanturn, Porygon2, and Snorlax handling them. Whimsicott is another revenge killer Floatzel has to fear, one that can be handled by Charizard, Magneton, and Articuno. Physical wallbreakers like Brute Bonnet and Glastrier can soften up teams for Floatzel to sweep, and cleaners like Hisuian Sneasel and Sneasel can take advantage of the holes Floatzel itself may open up for them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mesprit is a highly flexible Pokemon that is capable of fulfulling a multitude of roles within the ZU metagame. Its balanced stats and useful movepool allow Mesprit to work well in offensive and defensive utility roles, while its Nasty Plot set is a threatening sweeper that is extremely challenging for bulky builds to deal with. Mesprit is also a good check to Fighting-types such as Virizion and Passimian, and Levitate lets it deal with many Ground-types, such as Sandslash and Sandaconda. Unfortunately, Mesprit's balanced stats means that it isn't truly exceptional at any role that it tries to play, as its offensive stats aren't fantastic, and bulky sets are prone to getting chipped down over time. Its Psychic typing also leaves it vulnerable to common Dark-types, such as Sneasel, Brute Bonnet, and Hisuian Qwilfish, while also leaving it weak to the ubiquitous U-turn. Finally, Mesprit's coverage is quite limited, as it lacks a way to hit Steel-types hard and doesn't hit much of the metagame for super effective damage. This can lead to it sometimes struggling to break through bulky threats such as Articuno, Snorlax, and Porygon2.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set utilizing Psychic, Dazzling Gleam, Psyshock or Shadow Ball, and either Trick or U-turn is feasible. However, Mesprit isn't powerful enough to consistently break down defensive cores without perfect prediction, it can't hit Steel-types for significant damage, and its mediocre Speed tier means it isn't especially good against offensive teams either. The Nasty Plot set can consider Psychic Noise or Stored Power as its Psychic-type STAB move. The former prevents recovery from the likes of Articuno, Pallosand, and Snorlax, while the latter will become extremely powerful if Mesprit accrues multiple Nasty Plot boosts. However, Psyshock's ability to pressure common special walls like Lanturn, Snorlax, and Articuno makes it the most consistent option. The defensive pivot set can consider Colbur Berry as an alternative item to take Knock Off from the likes of Passimian, Sneasel, and Grafaiai as well as Dark-type attacks from Brute Bonnet. However, the loss of Leftovers recovery means that only offensive teams looking to play fast should consider this, and it loses value if Mesprit is forced to Terastallize. The defensive pivot could also use other Tera types, such as Tera Fairy to give a Dark resistance that is useful when facing down Sneasel, Brute Bonnet, and Passimian and Tera Water to grant useful resistances for Typhlosion, Floatzel, and Clawitzer. Tera Water, however, leaves Mesprit open to common Grass- and Electric-type attacks from Shaymin, Jolteon, and Brute Bonnet. Options like Thunder Wave to deter setup or and Pain Split to give Mesprit some form of recovery may seem appealing for the defensive set, but Mesprit tends to perform its role more consistently with the given moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: Dark-types such as Sneasel, Brute Bonnet, and Hisuian Qwilfish threaten Mesprit with their STAB moves and either force it to switch out or Terastallize. Mesprit is capable of pivoting out or hitting them with Fairy-type coverage as they switch in, however. Pokemon that Mesprit would otherwise check, such as Grafaiai, Passimian, Hisuian Sneasel, and Sandslash often run Dark-type coverage, limiting its ability to comfortably deal with them. Sableye and Spiritomb don't fear Mesprit's STAB moves, and Sableye can threaten to lock Mesprit into an ineffective move with Prankster Encore, though neither of them appreciate Fairy-type coverage, Knock Off, or Trick.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type attackers such as Mismagius, offensive Froslass, and Rotom threaten Mesprit with their STAB moves, but they can't comfortably switch in to most sets due to the threat of Knock Off, Trick, or a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Orthworm, Magneton, and Perrserker resist Mesprit's common coverage options, and they can use it as an opportunity to fire off a strong attack or, in Orthworm's case, set up Stealth Rock, Spikes, Coil, or Iron Defense. However, they must be wary of Trick or Knock Off. Additionally, certain Pokemon Mesprit usually checks, such as Weezing and Articuno, often run Tera Steel and can therefore turn the tables on Mesprit.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Mesprit's rather modest bulk means it can't comfortably answer many of the tier's strongest offensive threats. Typhlosion, Jolteon, and Floatzel outrun non-Choice Scarf Mesprit and threaten to do serious damage, even to the defensive set. Even slow wallbreakers such as Alolan Exeguttor and Clawitzer are still faster than the defensive pivot set and threaten it with extreme damage.</p>",

U-turn lets Mesprit keep up offensive momentum against switch-ins like Orthworm, Farigiraf, and Snorlax. Healing Wish lets Mesprit give teammates like Virizion, Snorlax, and Glastrier a second chance to set up and sweep. Mesprit can alternatively use Trick to make a defensive Pokemon like Snorlax, Orthworm, or Porygon2 less threatening. Tera Fairy Mesprit is a more effective offensive and defensive answer to Sneasel, Brute Bonnet, and Passimian given their Dark-type coverage moves, and Tera Fairy lets Mesprit not play guessing games with Psychic and Dazzling Gleam against Tera Dark Passimian. Tera Steel has good synergy with Levitate and gives Mesprit several new resistances to more easily answer Whimsicott, Sandslash, and Farigiraf.</p> <p>Offensive pivots like Jolteon and Magneton make great cores with Mesprit and appreciate Mesprit's Levitate to more easily play around Ground-types. Fighting-types like Virizion, Passimian, and Hitmontop are great offensive checks to Steel-types like Orthworm and Perrserker and specially defensive Normal-types like Snorlax and Porygon2, all of which give Mesprit trouble, and they appreciate Mesprit offensively checking Poison-types like Weezing, Qwilfish, and Hisuian Sneasel. Mesprit benefits from Ground-type teammates like Sandslash and Sandaconda patching up its poor matchup against Hisuian Qwilfish, while it can check foes like Virizion for them. Setup sweepers like Oricorio-F, Regirock, and Virizion benefit from Mesprit providing them second chances to sweep with Healing Wish or making foes more exploitable with Trick. Physical wallbreakers like Brute Bonnet, Glastrier, and Hisuian Sneasel all benefit from Healing Wish giving them an additional chance for breaking, as they can break special walls that Mesprit cannot.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Mesprit is a fearsome mid- or late-game sweeper thanks to the combination of Levitate and a somewhat high base 105 Special Attack stat. Its biggest perk is the ability to set up in front of most bulkier Pokémon. Mesprit can choose between Encore and Substitute as its setup tool; Substitute can be very good versus bulkier teams, as Mesprit can tank a hit from most of the passive mons such as Regirock and Lanturn if not being hit super effectively, obtaining a free turn to either set up Nasty Plot or fire off an attack. Encore helps to circumvent Mesprit's passivity and can take advantage of checks that need to set up or use status moves like Haze to wall Mesprit, like Articuno for the Haze case, and Regirock for the setup. Psyshock is great to deal with specially defensive Pokémon such as Snorlax and Porygon2. Draining Kiss allows Mesprit to outlast Dark-type checks such as Spiritomb and Sneasel while healing in the process, Thunderbolt allows it to hit and Flying- and Water-types such as Charizard and Clawitzer hard. Tera Fairy lets Mesprit set up in front of the aforementioned Dark-types, grants immunity to Dragon Tail from Dipplin and Appletun, and increases the power of Draining Kiss, letting Mesprit restore more HP on the aforementioned threats and making it even harder to take down. Tera Steel improves Mesprit's defensive capabilities, making it take neutral damage from Dark- and Ghost-type attacks and giving it a Bug resistance, while only being weak to Fighting- and Fire-type moves due to Levitate. Tera Electric boosts the power of Thunderbolt and removes all of Mesprit's weaknesses.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Sweeper Mesprit works well with specific entry hazard setters and Fighting-types. Hazard setters like Orthworm and Hisuian Qwilfish both cover each other's weaknesses and let Mesprit get rolls it wouldn't otherwise, such as KOing Honchkrow with Tera Fairy Draining Kiss after Stealth Rock chip damage. Fighting-types such as Scarf Passimian, Virizion, or Hitmonlee deserve a highlight, as when paired with Mesprit, they provide good coverage for it, pressuring Dark- and Steel-types with their STAB moves and Ghost-types with Knock Off. Each of them offers additional utility, with Virizion being bulky enough to enter in and provide wallbreaking prowess, Passimian having access to U-turn to let Mesprit in safely and Knock Off to offer utility, and Hitmonlee providing support with Knock Off and Rapid Spin. Secondary wallbreakers that don't rely on Setup to make progress such as Clawitzer and Magneton will also appreciate being by Mesprit's side. Some cleaners also enjoy Mesprit's ability to make progress so they can clean late-game, such as Dodrio and Hisuian Sneasel.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Mesprit's decent defensive profile and access to useful utility moves like Stealth Rock and Healing Wish allow it to act as a good defensive pivot. Its bulk and typing allows it to check foes such as Jolteon, Charizard, and Passimian locked into Close Combat. Psychic Noise is a useful STAB move that allows Mesprit to force out Hisuian Avalugg and Hitmontop, which are among the few viable hazard removers of the tier. Its decent Base Power and ability to prevent healing allow Mesprit to annoy other defensive Pokemon like Porygon2, Palossand, and Sandaconda. U-turn allows Mesprit to pivot out of poor matchups such as Glastrier and Spiritomb while keeping up momentum for its team. Knock Off allows Mesprit to punish foes that would feel comfortable coming in otherwise, such as Orthworm, Articuno, and Snorlax. Healing Wish is another option for offensive teams that allows Mesprit to fully heal an offensive teammate and give it another go at breaking down the opponent's team. It is capable of running both Knock Off and Healing Wish if your team already has another Stealth Rock user. Maximum Special Defense investment is preferred in order to better take hits from the likes of Charizard, Magneton, and Pyroar. A Sassy nature is preferred to give Mesprit a slow U-turn and maximize the damage that its physical attacks do. Steel is the preferred Tera type, as it turns each of Mesprit's weaknesses into a neutrality or a resistance and gives it a superb general defensive typing. It notably lets Mesprit handle Grafaiai, opposing Mesprit, and Whimsicott with more confidence. Tera Steel also has good synergy with Levitate and allows Mesprit to comfortably handle foes such as Sandslash, Sandaconda, and Palossand. Leftovers grants Mesprit passive recovery and helps it stay as healthy as possible throughout the match.</p> <p>Mesprit is one of the few bulky Stealth Rock setters in the tier that also has access to a pivoting move, which makes it highly useful for both balance and offense. Mesprit lacks reliable recovery, so teams utilizing it shouldn't expect it to be a stalwart wall. Rather, its good support movepool and defensive traits allow it to act as a stopgap that can take a few hits while also supporting its offensively oriented teammates via pivoting and utility moves such as Knock Off and Healing Wish. Mesprit's physical bulk is somewhat lacking, so physically defensive teammates such as Weezing, Sandaconda, and Palossand make for good partners. These three help out against Fighting-types such as Passimian, Hitmonlee, and Hisuian Sneasel, which Mesprit struggles to check in the long term. Dipplin serves as a good physically defensive partner and in particular a Knock Off absorber, which is highly useful for Mesprit because it fears Knock Off greatly. Mesprit is also vulnerable to Dark-types such as Hisuian Qwilfish, Sneasel, and Brute Bonnet. Teammates such as Hisuian Sneasel and Virizion can help with the latter, while Hisuian Qwilfish and the aforementioned Weezing can help with the former two. Teammates such as Passimian, Virizion, and Charizard can help check Steel-types such as Magneton and Orthworm, which Mesprit struggles to deal with on its own. Strong wallbreakers, such as Typhlosion, Glastrier, Brute Bonnet, and Alolan Exeggutor, appreciate Mesprit's slow U-turn getting them in safely, and they benefit from Mesprit's ability to use Knock Off to remove various items from defensive Pokemon such as Regirock, Orthworm, and Articuno. Mesprit also pairs well with other VoltTurn users; Passimian, Grafaiai, Whimsicott, and Floatzel also benefit from Mesprit bringing them in safely and can form a pivoting core that can slowly wear down the opponent's team. Pokemon such as Floatzel, Typhlosion, Charizard, and Glastrier appreciate Healing Wish support should Mesprit choose to run it, as they are all vulnerable to being worn down over the course of a match, and many teams are not prepared to deal with them a second time.</p>"

A powerful Moonblast and pivoting coupled with Choice Specs allow Whimsicott to break past bulkier threats like Hisuian Qwilfish and Glastrier. However, Whimsicott's low offensive stats leave it often wanting for power, especially without Choice Specs, and it's incapable of fitting every move it wants. Furthermore, lack of reliable recovery and only average bulk makes it unable to consistently check the Pokemon it's supposed to like Regirock and Sandaconda.</p>",

This set struggles to find setup opportunities however and relies heavily on getting a free Substitute on a forced switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Whimsicott's 4x weakness to Poison and inability to hit Poison-types with its STAB attacks makes Poison-types like Grafaiai and Weezing good checks. However, these Pokemon lack reliable recovery and can thus be worn down over a game.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Magneton and Orthworm can take Whimsicott's STAB attacks with ease. Orthworm can start setting entry hazards or set up with Coil or Iron Defense, while Magneton can generate momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: As Whimsicott's STAB attacks do little to them, Fire-types like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Magmortar can use Whimsicott as an entry point to start firing off powerful attacks. These Pokemon aren't usually defensively invested however and can struggle to switch in consistently.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Porygon2, Snorlax, and Articuno aren't bothered by Whimsicott's attacks and can use it to start forcing progress with entry hazards, status, pivoting, or boosts. However, Switcheroo completely ruins these walls, especially Articuno, and Encore can force them to repeat their status moves, allowing Whimsicott to safely bring in a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Many common Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai, Qwilfish, and Gunk Shot Passimian get the jump on Whimsicott and can easily take it out.</p>",

However, Whimsicott loses a substantial amount of power without its Choice Specs, so one must be careful about when to use Switcheroo.

Giga Drain is used for its ability to give Whimsicott staying power in longer games. Encore is key to this set, allowing it to force defensive foes into unfavorable moves like Stealth Rock and Recover, as well as shutting down setup sweepers like Oricorio-F and Snorlax by locking them into their setup moves. U-turn pairs beautifully with Encore, scouting any forced switches and allowing Whimsicott to bring in powerful teammates like Glastrier and Typhlosion. Tera Steel gives Whimsicott an immunity to Poison-type attacks from Grafaiai and Hisuian Qwilfish and a resistance to Flying-type attacks from Dodrio and Braviary as well as Ice-type attacks from Sneasel in a pinch. However, this still leaves Whimsicott vulnerable to Fire-type attacks from Charizard and Typhlosion and makes it weak to Fighting, making it unable to reliably switch into Brute Bonnet and Virizion. Tera Fire provides emergency resistances to Ice and Fire, but this makes Whimsicott unable to safely check Ground- and Rock-types like Sandaconda and Regirock.</p> <p>Balance teams enjoy Whimsicott's pivoting and Prankster Encore helping them deal with bulky defensive Pokemon and dangerous setup sweepers. Powerful physical wallbreakers like Glastrier and Passimian pair well with Whimsicott, as it baits in special walls like Articuno and can bring these teammates in with U-turn. Ground-types like Palossand and Sandaconda make for excellent partners, as Whimsicott helps them handle the Water- and Grass-types like Floatzel and Virizion that they struggle with, while they can handle Poison-types like Grafaiai that scare Whimsicott out.

    "overview": "<p>Virizion's great Speed tier and threatening offensive typing make it a dangerous offensive threat that can serve as both a wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner. Virizion has access to Swords Dance, which allows it to boost its attack and wallbreak consistently. Its great Speed tier lets it stay threatening versus offensive teams and even clean them up late-game when its checks are weakened or removed. Virizion has naturally high special bulk and a workable defensive typing that allow it to find set up opportunities versus Choice-locked special attackers like Jolteon, Magneton, and Clawitzer, and there is some ambiguity to its sets thanks to its good coverage and ability to run a physical or special set. However, Virizion isn't especially strong without a boost, and it can struggle to break through physically bulky checks like Weezing, Dipplin, and Qwilfish. Despite that, Virizion retains a very solid niche thanks to its higher Speed tier and its ability to run coverage options like Stone Edge and Zen Headbutt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Virizion can run a Tera Flying Calm Mind set using Giga Drain, Air Slash, and Focus Blast or Aura Sphere. This turns the tables on many of Virizion's traditional answers such as Dipplin and Weezing, and Virizion's STAB combination threatens several common special walls, such as Lanturn, Snorlax, and Porygon2. However, Virizion can only boost its Special Attack by one stage at a time with Calm Mind, and it is forced to use weak moves unless it opts for the inaccurate Focus Blast as its Fighting-type STAB move, which makes the set considerably less threatening in practice. A mixed attacker set with Leaf Storm, Close Combat, Stone Edge, and Synthesis with a Life Orb can be threatening to certain offensive and balance teams but fails to make significant progress versus builds packing common walls such as Dipplin, Mesprit, and Muk. Sacred Sword is an interesting alternative to Close Combat that ignores the Defense boosts on IronPress foes such as Regirock, Orthworm, and Naclstack and doesn't lower Virizion's own defenses, but the drop in power is very noticeable. Tera Fairy is a fringe alternative Tera type that gives Virizion a Fighting resistance, allowing it to stave off revenge killing from Choice Scarf Passimian, and an immunity to Dragon Tail, which lets it potentially break past Dipplin after accruing multiple Swords Dance boosts. Tera Poison grants Virizion a generally useful defensive typing to counteract revenge killing attempts from the likes of Whimsicott, Passimian, and Grafaiai. These are inferior to the other Tera types outside of these specific situations, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dipplin</strong>: Dipplin's massive physical bulk allows it to handily deal with the standard Swords Dance set. It isn't even 2HKOed by a +2 Close Combat and can use Dragon Tail to phaze Virizion before healing off any damage, which makes it a very reliable answer. It has to be wary of a surprise Calm Mind set, however, and the rare Tera Fairy can turn it into setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types such as Weezing, Muk, and Qwilfish resist Virizion's STAB moves and threaten it in return with their STAB moves or, in Weezing's case, a burn from Will-O-Wisp. They must be cautious of Zen Headbutt, however. Grafaiai, Hisuian Sneasel, and Choice Scarf Qwilfish are faster than Virizion and can OHKO it with Gunk Shot or, in Grafaiai's case, cripple it with Encore or Switcheroo. Additionally, several Pokemon that Virizion usually threatens, such as Brute Bonnet and Regirock, commonly run Tera Poison and can therefore turn the tables on it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Virizion's Speed tier, while very solid, still leaves it outpaced by several common revenge killers. Choice Scarf Passimian, Whimsicott, Sneasel, and Choice Scarf Typhlosion all outrun Virizion and can threaten to revenge kill it. All but the latter two need chip damage dealt before they can KO Virizion, however, and only Whimsicott and Passimian can directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns and paralysis are especially threatening to Virizion. Common Pokemon such as Weezing, Lanturn, Porygon2, and Charizard are all capable of spreading those status conditions, and Virizion is not capable of OHKOing any of them except for Charizard if it chooses to run Stone Edge. However, Lum Berry allows Virizion to circumvent this and set up on many of these foes fearlessly.</p>",

Justified dissuades foes such as Passimian and Poliwrath from attempting to remove Virizion's item via Knock Off. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Virizion to come in multiple times throughout a game without fear of chip damage from entry hazards. However, Lum Berry is a viable alternative on offensive teams, as it allows Virizion to set up safely on foes that might try to cripple it with status, such as Mesprit, Rotom, and Sandaconda. Tera Rock allows Stone Edge to OHKO Whimsicott and 2HKO Weezing after Stealth Rock damage at +2. It also gives Virizion a resistance to Fire- and Flying-type attacks, which lets it deal with Charizard, Typhlosion, and Oricorio-F with more confidence. Tera Psychic lets Zen Headbutt 2HKO Tera Poison Regirock at +2, do significantly more damage to Weezing and defensive Qwilfish, removes Virizion's weakness to their Poison-type STAB moves, and gives Virizion a useful Fighting resistance that can foil revenge killing attempts from Choice Scarf Passimian and opposing Virizion.</p> <p>Virizion's great Speed tier and ability to both wallbreak and sweep depending on the situation make it usable on teams ranging from balanced to hyper offensive team styles. Virizion dislikes facing down extremely bulky physical walls such as Dipplin and Weezing and Iron Defense Pokemon such as Regirock and Orthworm, which can also outlast Virizion should they begin boosting as it comes in. Strong special attackers, such as Nasty Plot Mesprit, Magneton, and Charizard, are therefore good teammates; the former is especially good at disrupting these extremely bulky threats. These teammates appreciate Virizion's Speed tier helping them out against offensive builds and its ability to threaten special walls like Lanturn and Porygon2. Virizion appreciates entry hazards on the opponent's side, as it tends to force a lot of switches and loves seeing its defensive checks worn down. Stealth Rock setters such as Mesprit, Regirock, and Palossand are good teammates as a result, as are Spikes setters like Qwilfish and Orthworm. These bulky hazard setters help to check revenge killers that are dangerous to Virizion; Regirock, Porygon2, and Naclstack can help check Choice Scarf Typhlosion; Mesprit and Palossand help out versus Choice Scarf Passimian; and Qwilfish and Orthworm can deal with Choice Scarf Floatzel. Lanturn pivots into Fire-types like Typhlosion and Charizard easily and can bring Virizion into battle safely with Volt Switch. Virizion pairs well with other physical wallbreakers, especially on offense and hyper offense, as they can work together to break down their shared defensive answers.

Earthquake is Passimian's best coverage move for Poison-types like Neutralizing Gas Weezing, Qwilfish, Hisuian Sneasel, and Muk.

Passimian luring in physically defensive Pokemon like Sandaconda and Dipplin enables partners like Mesprit and Whimsicott to take advantage of them when Passimian pivots out with U-turn, and in turn, Passimian threatens Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton for them. Ghost-types like Palossand and Mismagius can exploit Passimian locked into Close Combat, Earthquake, or Gunk Shot, so teammates like Snorlax, Porygon2, and Hisuian Qwilfish are great teammates. Likewise, Passimian appreciates specially offensive teammates like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Charizard that can exploit physically defensive Pokemon like Weezing and Dipplin that it lures in.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Colbur Berry can dull the initial damage from Knock Off if Palossand is facing off against strong attackers like Hitmonlee or Passimian, but the passive benefits of Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots carry over better if Palossand Terastallizes. The additional power of Earth Power is less useful to Palossand compared to fishing for status with Scorching Sands and Sludge Bomb. Tera Dark affords Palossand more flexibility against Lanturn, Rotom, and Prankster-boosted status moves from Grafaiai and Whimsicott.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Virizion threatens Palossand and can set up to break past its physical bulk. Specially offensive Grass-types like Whimsicott, Sceptile, and Alolan Exeggutor take advantage of Palossand's poorer special bulk. Lurantis can remove Palossand's Stealth Rock, and it and Dipplin can use Palossand as an opportunity to set up. All Grass-types must be wary of Sludge Bomb though, and Scorching Sands's burn chance is problematic for physically offensive ones.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Glastrier threatens Palossand and can use it to set up. Articuno is similarly bulky and only dislikes a lucky Sludge Bomb poison. Sneasel can break through Palossand, but neither it nor Glastrier want to take a burn from Scorching Sands, and chip damage from Rocky Helmet adds up on Sneasel if it uses Triple Axel. Palossand blocks Rapid Spin from Hisuian Avalugg and threatens it with Scorching Sands but takes a lot of damage from Mountain Gale.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Qwilfish, Floatzel, and Veluza can break past Palossand’s great bulk with their powerful Water-type STAB moves but must consider Water Compaction, Tera, and Palossand’s Shadow Ball. Clawitzer has few issues breaking Palossand.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special wallbreakers like Mesprit and Jolteon break past Palossand’s much lower special bulk but are vulnerable to Shadow Ball and Scorching Sands. Special sweepers like Farigiraf and Oricorio-F can exploit Palossand’s underwhelming damage output to set up.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Oricorio-F and Braviary can capitalize on Palossand's difficulty in dealing damage to them to use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Trick and Switcheroo</strong>: A Choice-lock is terrible for Palossand's ability to wall foes, so Rotom and Mesprit are very disruptive if they swap a Choice item onto it with Trick.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Poison and Toxic from Grafaiai and Qwilfish formes puts Palossand on a timer and makes it more reliant on using Shore Up, but none of them tolerate burns or take Scorching Sands very well.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Grafaiai and Whimsicott can use Encore to lock Palossand into a status move or weak move to exploit it, but they are weak to Scorching Sands and Sludge Bomb, respectively. Primeape can use Taunt to stop Palossand from setting up Stealth Rock or recovering but dislikes Scorching Sands. Sableye can irritate Palossand with Taunt or Encore.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Palossand's great physical bulk, unique typing, and access to recovery enable it to wall many physical attackers such as Passimian, Snorlax, and Regirock. Palossand's Ghost typing enables it to block Rapid Spin from Sandslash and can help it in a pinch against Hisuian Avalugg despite Palossand's Ice weakness, which adds to Palossand's reliability as an entry hazard setter. Palossand's decent Special Attack and STAB Shadow Ball's neutral coverage are acceptably strong and keep Palossand from being too passive. Scorching Sands is a nice complementary STAB move that can spread burns, making Palossand’s role as a physical wall even easier by stifling physical sweepers such as Snorlax and Regirock. Sludge Bomb is an alternative to threaten Grass-types that check Palossand like Virizion and Whimsicott. Tera Dragon lets Palossand flip its weaknesses versus Water- and Grass-types, whereas Tera Water trades a Grass resistance for an Ice resistance, and both have great synergy with Water Compaction. Tera Poison grants Palossand a poison immunity and Grass resistance for Grass-type counters like Whimsicott and Dipplin while retaining a good defensive matchup against Fighting-type moves.</p> <p>Palossand is a great addition to teammates looking for a partner that provides role compression of taking on physical attackers and setting up Stealth Rock. Specially defensive Pokemon form great bulky cores with Palossand. Snorlax can use Thick Fat to take on challenging Ice-type attackers like Froslass and Articuno for Palossand, and it appreciates Palossand dealing with Fighting-type threats to it like Passimian and Hitmonlee. Articuno threatens Water- and Grass-types like Clawitzer and Whimsicott for Palossand with its Freeze-Dry, and in turn, it enjoys Palossand providing protection against problematic physical attackers like Regirock and Snorlax. Porygon2 can take on special attackers like Whimsicott and Mismagius for Palossand, while Porygon2 appreciates Palossand taking on Fighting-types like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel that would threaten to break it or cause it to Terastallize prematurely. Lurantis resists many of Palossand’s weaknesses and can support Rocky Helmet Palossand by using Defog to help with hazard chip damage. Dipplin can absorb Knock Off for Palossand thanks to Sticky Hold, and other Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Virizion can also threaten the Grass- and Water-types Palossand struggles with, such as Floatzel. Qwilfish and Hisuian Qwilfish enjoy Palossand keeping their Spikes up, while Palossand appreciates Intimidate and hazard stacking to wear down the Pokemon it walls.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Sandaconda is a good defensive Pokemon in SV ZU thanks to its bulk and Shed Skin. The increased reliability of Rest as recovery lends Sandaconda the longevity to check Pokemon like Grafaiai, Hitmonlee, and Passimian. Options like Stealth Rock, Glare, and Coil diversify Sandaconda into a great support Pokemon or a bulky setup sweeper. Sandaconda is an excellent Terastallization user to boot, enhancing its defensive profile to become even tougher to break or enabling its own sweeps. However, Shed Skin does not make Rest perfectly reliable, hampering Sandaconda's consistency. Physical attackers with super effective STAB moves like Brute Bonnet, Glastrier, and Virizion are very problematic for Sandaconda and coerce it to burn Terastallization for its team. Despite its Electric immunity, Sancaonda's lower special bulk can leave it to be overwhelmed by coverage and additional STAB attacks from Jolteon, Magneton, and Rotom. Sandaconda also faces competition from Regirock, another Stealth Rock setter that much more reliably takes on physical attackers like Snorlax, Glastrier, and Sneasel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandaconda has access to Body Press, which does hit Orthworm and Snorlax harder, but Rock Blast and Scale Shot provide better general coverage against most Pokemon immune to Ground. High Horsepower can be run instead of Earthquake if Thwackey is a teammate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types take little damage from Earthquake and threaten Sandaconda out with their STAB moves. Dipplin, Appletun, and Lurantis can wall Sandaconda in longer games. Lurantis and Toedscruel can remove Sandaconda's Stealth Rock and Rocky Helmet. Whimsicott and Calm Mind Virizion can easily take advantage of Sandaconda, though they don't appreciate Glare hurting their great Speed stats. Shaymin shrugs off paralysis from Glare thanks to Natural Cure. Tera Dragon and Scale Shot can give Coil Sandaconda some recourse against some Grass-types but can make its position against Pokemon like Dipplin, Whimsicott, and Dazzling Gleam Shaymin worse.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Ground</strong>: Ground-immune walls like Articuno and Dipplin can walk on Sandaconda, while Orthworm can use it as fodder for setting up Coil or entry hazards. Mesprit and Mismagius can use Sandaconda to set up, block its Glare with Substitute, and use Tera Fairy to completely wall sets with Scale Shot. Oricorio-F can set up on Sandaconda and use Taunt to deny Glare. However, Ground-immune Pokemon weak to Rock, such as Charizard and Oricorio-F, must be wary of Rock Blast or Stone Edge. Only Rotom-C, Vikavolt, and Rotom are immune to Glare.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Sandaconda's lower special bulk leaves it easily overwhelmed by Typhlosion, Jolteon, and Magneton, though all of them are OHKOed by Earthquake and must be wary of Sandaconda catching them with a defensive Terastallization.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Clawitzer, Floatzel, Veluza hit Sandaconda for strong super effective damage and generally tolerate an Earthquake. Qwilfish is capable of finishing off Sandaconda but is vulnerable to Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Sneasel is powerful enough to overwhelm Sandaconda with a boost or some chip damage and can pick off Sandaconda's offensive Scale Shot set with Ice Shard even if Sandaconda has a boost, though it takes a lot of Rocky Helmet chip damage from Sandaconda when it uses Triple Axel. Glastrier is bulky enough to take two five-hit Rock Blasts from Sandaconda and threatens it with a strong Icicle Crash.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Sandaconda is a great wall thanks to its natural bulk, Shed Skin, and Ground typing. Common physical attackers like Grafaiai, Passimian, and Regirock struggle to break through Sandaconda, and its great defensive profile enables it to consistently set up Stealth Rock. Rock Blast lets Sandaconda strike foes such as Articuno, Charizard, and Mismagius that it cannot touch with Earthquake. Alternatively, Glare lets Sandaconda spread paralysis and punish Pokemon like Dipplin, Orthworm, and Virizion that it would deal little damage to anyway. Rest and Shed Skin can keep Sandaconda healthy, especially as it takes on Poison Touch Grafaiai sets and Hisuian Qwilfish, although the inconsistency of Shed Skin can leave it out to dry. Rocky Helmet helps Sandaconda further wear down physical attackers like Snorlax, Regirock, and Hisuian Qwilfish trying to break through it, and it enables Sandaconda to punish U-turn from pivots like Mesprit, Grafaiai, and Passimian. Tera Poison makes Sandaconda a more reliable wall to physical attackers like Passimian, Sneasel, and Hitmonlee. Tera Ghost makes Sandaconda an even more sturdy wall to physical setup sweepers like Snorlax and Regirock, improves its matchups against Fighting-types like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel, and lets it spinblock Sandslash and Hisuian Avalugg. Tera Water helps Sandaconda handle Floatzel, Sneasel, and Glastrier.</p> <p>Sandaconda is a good physical wall for balanced teams looking to compress entry hazard setting on a teammate that isn't bothered as much by residual damage and status compared to Regirock, Orthworm, and Sandslash. Bulkier offensive teams also benefit from the utility and bulk Sandaconda offers in Glare and absorbing status from Weezing, Muk, and Hisuian Qwilfish for offensive teammates. Hisuian Qwilfish makes an excellent hazard-stacking core with Sandaconda, and they complement each other's defensive flaws; Hisuian Qwilfish defensively answers Grass-types like Dipplin, Virizion, and Whimsicott and Levitate Pokemon like Mesprit and Mismagius, while Sandaconda deals with Passimian, Sandslash, and Muk. Sandaconda's Water weakness makes teammates like Lanturn, Whimsicott, and Dipplin helpful for managing Clawitzer and Floatzel. Sandaconda is not offensively threatening to walls like Dipplin and Articuno, so teammates like Magneton and Charizard can compensate for Sandaconda's poor matchup against them and have an easier time against said targets if Sandaconda has paralyzed them with Glare. Sandaconda invites in hazard setters like Palossand and Orthworm due to its passivity, so teamamates that can remove hazards like Hisuian Avalugg and Hitmontop make good partners for Sandaconda.</p>"

      "Coil": {
        "description": "<p>Sandaconda serves as a deadly late-game threat with the powerful combination of Coil, Rest, and Shed Skin. Earthquake hits most of the tier for at least neutral damage, while Sandaconda's other attacking move hits Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake like Bombirdier, Oricorio-F, and Braviary. Scale Shot allows Sandaconda to boost its Speed, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame except for common Choice Scarf users like Typhlosion at +2. Alternatively, Stone Edge doesn't drop Sandaconda's Defense and has more immediate potential to threaten Flying-types like Oricorio-F, Articuno, and Charizard. Rest acts as excellent recovery to keep Sandaconda healthy and combines well with Shed Skin to make it more reliable and help it serve as a wall in early- and mid-game scenarios, especially when combined with Tera Dragon to flip matchups on common Water- and Grass-types like Swords Dance Qwilfish and Rotom-C. Coil Sandaconda can opt to run less Speed in exchange for more bulk, with 224 Speed EVs and a neutral nature being enough to outpace base 110 Speed Pokemon at +1; however, running these Speed EVs means it no longer outspeeds common Chlorophyll sweepers like Victreebel and faster Choice Scarf users like Mismagius and Floatzel at +2. Sandaconda can also opt to run Attack investment instead of HP, but this makes it more difficult to wall the foes it's tasked with setting up on late-game.</p> <p>Levitate users such as Mesprit and Mismagius serve as potentially problematic Pokemon, since they are immune to Earthquake and can become fully immune to Sandaconda's moves, if it's running Scale Shot, with Tera Fairy, so specially bulky teammates like Hisuian Qwilfish and Snorlax can be extremely helpful to counteract them. Orthworm poses similar issues due to Earth Eater and Iron Defense, so wallbreakers that threaten it like Charizard and Typhlosion are invaluable as teammates. These two as well as Bombirdier and Glastrier also threaten Grass-types, which cause problems for Sandaconda pre-Terastallization. Water-types pose similar issues while also often carrying super effective coverage for Terastallized Sandaconda, so teammates like Snorlax, Poliwrath, and Virizion benefit it greatly. In return for all of these potential partners' help, Sandaconda turns many physical attackers into setup fodder. Some common examples of Pokemon completely walled by it late-game include Passimian, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Regirock; after Terastallization, this list expands to include other offensive threats like Floatzel, Qwilfish, and Rotom-C.</p>"

It has outstanding bulk for ZU; furthermore, its stellar base 145 Attack, Icicle Crash, and all the coverage it needs including Close Combat and High Horsepower make it extremely difficult to switch into. Lastly, Glastrier can boost its Attack even further with Swords Dance, allowing it to potentially OHKO or 2HKO almost the entire metagame. Defensive staples like Palossand, Snorlax, and Appletun are often forced to Terastallize or switch out versus it. This means that Glastrier's most reliable defensive counterplay is somewhat specific, being limited to almost exclusively both forms of Qwilfish, Regirock, and Orthworm, none of which have reliable recovery, and the latter two of which often require Terastallization to fully check Glastrier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glastrier can opt to run Heavy Slam alongside Tera Steel over High Horsepower to hit light foes like Mesprit and Steel-weak foes like Tera Fairy Dipplin and Malamar. However, trading out High Horsepower for Heavy Slam tends to be overkill, as Glastrier's standard three-move coverage sufficiently hits all relevant foes; furthermore, giving up High Horsepower makes it struggle more against foes like Hisuian Qwilfish. Glastrier can also consider running Substitute to ease prediction, but all of its coverage moves are near mandatory, and without Swords Dance, Glastrier can struggle to threaten the walls it needs to.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Glastrier's awful Speed means it can often be a target for offensive threats like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Passimian, though it often has to be chipped in order to not take them down with it.</p> <p><strong>Qwilfish</strong>: Both forms of Qwilfish can be quite problematic for Glastrier; regular Qwilfish resists every move except High Horsepower, which it takes relatively little damage from after Intimidate, while Hisuian Qwilfish sports better overall bulk due to its Eviolite. Furthermore, both can use Glastrier's massive HP stat against it with Pain Split, allowing them to trade positively with it and poison it with Barb Barrage or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Threats</strong>: Iron Press users like Orthworm and Regirock can match Glastrier's setup and threaten it out, though they may at times require Terastallization to do so. Poliwrath and Snorlax can do the same with Bulk Up and Curse, respectively, though Snorlax must Terastallize first. Weezing is able to neuter Glastrier with Will-O-Wisp and can switch in fairly safely, only fearing boosted Icicle Crash.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Glastrier gets worn down rapidly by poison from Pokemon like Qwilfish and Muk as well as burn from Pokemon like Weezing and Mismagius; burn also neuters its damage.</p>",

Tera Ground gives Glastrier a resistance to Rock while boosting the power of High Horsepower, while Tera Water and Fairy flip Glastrier's weaknesses to common offensive types like Fire and Fighting. 252 Speed EVs allows it to outspeed slower walls like Regirock and Porygon2, while the bulk investment lets it take on powerful attacks from various threats in the tier.</p> <p>Glastrier greatly appreciates teammates that can help bring it in safely like Jolteon, Qwilfish, and Mesprit, since it often has to take a hit after switching in due to its poor Speed.

Grafaiai can also put its excellent Speed to work as a Swords Dance sweeper, and it can be further enabled by Prankster, Encore, and Copycat. Grafaiai even has a viable Choice Scarf set, and it's effectively one of the fastest Choice Scarf users in the metagame. However, Grafaiai is altogether frail and possesses a bad defensive typing, leaving pivot and Swords Dance sets easily revenge killed or threatened out by faster offensive Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Passimian, while its Choice Scarf set can be stonewalled by defensive Pokemon like Regirock and Orthworm without good prediction.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grafaiai can be a niche Prankster weather setter for sun teams that further provides safe entry and setup opportunities for its teammates with U-turn, Parting Shot, and Encore. Grafaiai has Taunt in its toolkit but struggles to use it effectively given its underwhelming bulk and the comparatively greater potential of Encore. Choice Band sets can work given Grafaiai's excellent Speed and powerful STAB moves, but they lack the outstanding Speed of Choice Scarf sets to avoid being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users and faster revenge killers. Toxic can be used on pivot sets with Prankster for more reliable status spreading than Poison Touch, but Grafaiai's frailty makes spending a turn to poison a foe risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Even Swords Dance Grafaiai struggles to break through Sandaconda and Weezing on its own without prior chip damage, and pivot sets struggle to do more than remove their items or use Encore on them. Palossand dislikes losing its item to Knock Off or being poisoned, but it has the bulk and longevity to withstand attacks from Grafaiai. However, Palossand should be wary both of Encore and Swords Dance Grafaiai's Knock Off. Regirock can fend off pivot Grafaiai short-term thanks to its bulk but can be worn down by a combination of Knock Off, poison, and chip damage, and it risks being OHKoed by Swords Dance Grafaiai's Low Kick. Despite a Poison immunity, Orthworm is a similar story to Regirock, though it can survive Swords Dance Grafaiai's boosted Low Kick if Terastallization isn't in the picture.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Spiritomb's trio of immunities to Double-Edge, Low Kick, and Prankster moves on top of its 4x resistance to Gunk Shot makes it an excellent wall to Swords Dance Grafaiai, but its dependence on Leftovers for recovery can lead it to being worn down by offensive pivot sets using Knock Off and U-turn, especially when Poison Touch is in the picture. Grafaiai can overwhelm Hisuian Qwilfish between Knock Off, U-turn, and its lack of recovery. Sneasel can \"trap\" Grafaiai by blocking its escape with Prankster Parting Shot and threatening it with its strong STAB moves, and its Ice Shard is still faster than Prankster Copycat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Jolteon, Floatzel, and Hisuian Sneasel naturally outspeed Grafaiai and threaten it with their powerful STAB attacks, though they should be wary of Grafaiai's Prankster moves, Copycat in particular. Common Choice Scarf users such as Mesprit, Passimian, and Magneton similarly threaten to revenge kill Grafaiai and can gain momentum with their pivot moves, though Choice Scarf Grafaiai is faster than all of these and the aforementioned revenge killers. Choice Band Floatzel outspeeds Grafaiai's Swords Dance set and has Aqua Jet to finish it off even if Grafaiai has Prankster + Copycat.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Grafaiai distinguishes itself as a phenomenal offensive pivot and revenge killer by virtue of its decent Attack, powerful STAB options, and incredible Speed tier, outpacing the entire unboosted metagame and even many other Choice Scarf users such as Typhlosion and Passimian. Furthermore, Poison Touch gives Grafaiai the rare ability to punish otherwise safe switch-ins, such as Regirock, Palossand, and Hisuian Avalugg, with a chance to get poisoned as it pivots out with U-turn. Gunk Shot is essential to dispatch threats such as Whimsicott and Virizion. Knock Off provides Grafaiai with the coverage to hit foes that resist its STAB moves such as Mismagius and Froslass. Additionally, it punishes bulky foes reliant on their items, such as Orthworm and Hisuian Qwilfish that cannot be afflicted by Poison Touch, as well as removing Rocky Helmet from the likes of Palossand, Sandaconda, and Qwilfish to ease its pivoting later. Double-Edge grants Grafaiai an accurate STAB option and enables it to muscle past Poison-resistant Pokemon such as Muk and Hisuian Qwilfish, though it comes at the cost of recoil damage. Double-Edge also eliminates the need for predicting Terastallization from potential Tera Ground users like Oricorio-F and Charizard compared to Gunk Shot. Switcheroo can be used instead to restrict defensive checks such as Orthworm and Palossand, as well as Choice-locking setup sweepers such as Regirock, Oricorio-F, and Mesprit, though it requires subsequent use of Knock Off to be more measured to avoid unintentionally freeing them. Tera Dark allows Grafaiai to better revenge kill the likes of Mismagius and resist moves such as Sucker Punch from threats such as Brute Bonnet and Hitmonlee. Furthermore, gaining an immunity to Psychic-type moves can allow Grafaiai to turn the tables against the likes of Mespirit and Farigiraf in a pinch. Alternatively, Tera Normal can be used in conjunction with Double-Edge to let Grafaiai secure reliable OHKOs, dispatching threats like Jolteon and, after Stealth Rock damage, Typhlosion.</p> <p>Grafaiai fits well on offense and balance teams that can benefit from its ability to generate momentum and take on top offensive threats. Offensive setup sweepers such as Virizion, Mesprit, and Oricorio-F appreciate Grafaiai's ability to revenge kill opposing setup sweepers for them such as Farigiraf and Oricorio-F. Grafaiai can form offensive pivot cores with the likes of Floatzel, Jolteon, and Magneton, maintaining momentum and whittling down each other's checks. Grafaiai lures in Regirock and bulky Ground-type Pokemon like Sandaconda that are forced out by Floatzel and Virizion, while Grafaiai can return the favor by dealing with the likes of Whimsicott. Lanturn is especially notable for its ability to bring Grafaiai in safely via slow pivoting support. Physical wallbreakers such as Virizion, Glastrier, and Brute Bonnet can open up holes in opposing teams by eliminating bulky Pokemon like Snorlax, Palossand, and Sandaconda so Grafaiai can clean late-game. Powerful special attacking wallbreakers such as Alolan Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Clawitzer can take advantage of the physically defensive walls Grafaiai lures in such as Regirock, Orthworm, Hisuian Avalugg, and Weezing, assisting Grafaiai in getting past them. Fire-types such as Charizard and Typhlosion can take on Orthworm for Grafaiai while also benefiting from Grafaiai chipping down a shared check in Regirock. Entry hazard setters such as Mesprit and Orthworm synergize well with the residual damage inflicted from Grafaiai's Poison Touch, frequent pivoting, and Knock Off support, putting additional pressure on its aforementioned defensive checks, as well as bringing offensive threats like Typhlosion into range for Grafaiai to pick them off. Mesprit can also help against Poison- and Ground-types like Weezing, Qwilfish, and Sandslash. Bulky setup sweepers such as Dipplin, Snorlax, and Regirock benefit from poison spread by Grafaiai's Poison Touch, allowing them to more easily outlast foes thanks to poison chip damage. Hazard removal support from the likes of Hisuian Avalugg and Sandslash can help alleviate Grafaiai's weakness to chip damage that arises from its repeated pivoting.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Grafaiai is a threatening Swords Dance sweeper thanks to its high Speed and powerful STAB Double-Edge. Knock Off covers Ghost-types like Palossand, Rotom, and Mismagius that would otherwise wall Grafaiai, and it can soften up defensive Pokemon like Regirock and Orthworm to make them more easily picked off once they've been further chipped. Copycat's extra priority from Prankster lets Grafaiai overcome faster revenge killers like Jolteon, Sneasel formes, and Floatzel as well as Choice Scarf users such as Mesprit and Passimian, though its efficacy can fluctuate depending on the move that was used last. Low Kick is an alternative for a direct attack to knock down Rock- and Steel-types like the aforementioned Regirock and Orthworm as well as Hisuian Avalugg and Magneton, overall enhancing Grafaiai's wallbreaking ability. Prankster is integral for sets running Copycat, but Grafaiai without it should use Posion Touch, which can help it make more progress against Regirock and other Pokemon early-game. Grafaiai can opt for an Adamant nature to increase its power for more reliable KOs against physically defensive Pokmeon such as Orthworm and Regirock with its coverage moves, relying more on Prankster Encore to sweep teams at the cost of moving after threats like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Mismagius. Tera Normal cranks up the power of Grafaiai's STAB move to blow through physical walls like Weezing and Sandaconda without needing much chip damage. Tera Fighting is an alternative Tera type that can be used to power up Low Kick in order to secure more KOs on troublesome foes like Regirock, Orthworm, and Magneton. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Grafaiai won't be worn down if it comes out earlier in games to play as a revenge killer and soften up its checks with Knock Off. A Silk Scarf can further power up Tera Normal Grafaiai's Double-Edge to pull off feats like OHKOing Sandaconda and Weezing when at +2.</p> <p>Grafaiai fits on several types of teams thanks to its threatening offensive profile and great Speed, enabling it to be a revenge killer or cleaner alongside its role as a Swords Dance sweeper. Grafaiai especially benefits from pivot support from teammates such as Floatzel, Jolteon, and Mesprit to bring it in safely and widen setup opportunities for it. Grafaiai appreciates entry hazards from setters like Sandslash, Regirock, and Hisuian Avalugg wearing down foes like Regirock, Dipplin, and Snorlax so it can more effectively sweep. Spikes setters like Froslass, Qwilfish formes, and Orthworm are especially effective at softening up foes like Sandaconda, Palossand, and Magneton for Grafaiai. Grafaiai can maximize the utility of its hazard-setting partners by using Knock Off to remove Leftovers from Regirock as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Palossand, Sandslash, and Hisuian Avalugg. Charizard, Passimian, and Typhlosion pressure Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton that stand in Grafaiai's way and can soften up teams with their wallbreaking capabilities. Defensive teammates such as Poliwrath and Mesprit can help against revenge killers such as Floatzel and Sneasel formes, while Weezing and Palossand can help against others such as Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Grafaiai uses Gunk Shot as its STAB move to most effectively threaten Grass-types like Whimsicott, Dipplin, and Virizion. Knock Off lets Grafaiai make quick progress, especially with Poison Touch, and it effectively punishes defensive switch-ins such as Hisuian Qwilfish, Orthworm, and Regirock that depend on their items for their longevity. Knock Off also provides coverage against frail Ghost-types like Froslass and Mismagius. Knock Off absorbers like Booster Energy Brute Bonnet and Dipplin are also threatened by STAB Gunk Shot and potential poisons from Poison Touch hindering them. U-turn has the best synergy with Poison Touch, breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy against entry hazard setters like Froslass and Hisuian Avalugg, and doesn't risk activating Passimian's Defiant unlike Parting Shot. Parting Shot allows Grafaiai to escape even faster Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Mesprit in conjunction with Prankster, and its debuffs can enable Grafaiai's offensive and defensive teammates alike. Encore lets Grafaiai take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Palossand and Dipplin, and it can neutralize setup sweepers like Mesprit and Virizion. Prankster facilitates Encore even further, letting Grafaiai lock faster setup sweepers like Jolteon and Floatzel into their setup moves. Prankster Copycat can be used as an alternative to Encore to give Grafaiai a priority attack based on the last moved used and cut off would-be revenge killers like Choice Scarf Mesprit. Tera Dark affords Grafaiai a convenient defensive typing against Mesprit's Psychic-type STAB moves as well as Sucker Punch from Brute Bonnet and Hitmonlee. Tera Dark also powers up Grafaiai's Knock Off to more effectively threaten Mesprit and previously mentioned Ghost-types. However, Grafaiai is often better off not Terastallizing given the limited benefits it gains from doing so, better preserving the resource for a teammate.</p> <p>Grafaiai is a great enabler to offensive teammates, especially physical wallbreakers like Brute Bonnet, Glastrier, and Virizion that can take advantage of defensive Pokemon it lures in such as Sandaconda and Palossand. Other Fighting-types like Passimian and Hitmonlee can also threaten Pokemon like Regirock, Orthworm, and Magneton for Grafaiai while benefitting from it softening up foes with Knock Off, poison status, and U-turn chip damage. Charizard and Typhlosion can threaten Orthworm and Magneton in particular for Grafaiai, and they're supported as wallbreakers by the safe entry points Grafaiai provides via U-turn and Parting Shot. Special setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Mesprit, Oricorio-F, and Calm Mind Jolteon also benefit greatly from Grafaiai creating setup opportunities with Encore and Parting Shot, and they threaten physically defensive Pokemon Grafaiai struggles against. Grafaiai relies on partners like Mesprit and Magneton to deal with Poison-type walls like Qwilfish and Weezing. Bulky partners such as Lanturn and Porygon2 can help Grafaiai against Jolteon, a common revenge killer. Palossand and Sandaconda can intercept Choice Scarf Passimian from revenge killing Grafaiai, while Grafaiai helps them in return by threatening troublesome Grass-types like Whimsicott and Virizion. Floatzel is one more potential revenge killer to Grafaiai, and it can be handled by defensive teammates such as Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Dipplin.</p>"

With both Stealth Rock and Spikes at its disposal, Orthworm can be an excellent defensive entry hazard setter for its team; furthermore, it has multiple setup moves in Iron Defense and Coil that let it serve as both a defensive check to opposing physical attackers and a potential bulky setup sweeper with Body Press. Orthworm has two pain points holding it back from further success: special attacks threaten severe damage to it, and it can get worn down rapidly due to its lack of a reliable recovery move, especially if it loses its Leftovers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Orthworm can opt to run a few other Tera types if it desires; Tera Electric allows it to avoid being hit super effectively by any attack, while Tera Poison and Tera Fairy provide a Fighting resistance as well as additional defensive utility in more specific matchups. However, these Tera types introduce weaknesses to wallbreakers like Mesprit and Magneton, which are more common than Ghost-types like Mismagius and Rotom. Lastly, Orthworm can opt to run Rock Slide or Rock Blast to hit opposing Fire-types particularly hard on the switch, but it struggles to fit these over any of its moves without impacting its utility or ability to sweep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type foes like Virizion and Passimian often force Orthworm to either Terastallize or switch out unless it's already properly set up.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type foes like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Oricorio-F put immense pressure on Orthworm with their STAB attacks. Orthworm also struggles to deal damage against Charizard and Oricorio-F due to them resisting both Iron Tail and Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Rotom, Palossand, and Sableye are all immune to Body Press and either threaten Orthworm directly with their own moves or threaten status to severely hinder its sweep.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Burn from foes like Charizard, Weezing, and Rotom significantly hinders Orthworm's damage output, neutralizes its Leftovers recovery, and limits its sweeping ability, though it can at least use Substitute to circumvent Will-O-Wisp attempts against slower foes like Weezing.</p> <p><strong>Encore and Taunt</strong>: Encore from foes like Mesprit and Whimsicott can disrupt Orthworm in the middle of its setup attempts, as does Taunt from the likes of Mismagius and Oricorio-F. Taunt also denies its attempts to set entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Item Disruption</strong>: Knock Off from foes like Mesprit, Grafaiai, and Sandslash severely injures Orthworm's longevity due to its reliance on Leftovers, as does Switcheroo from Rotom and Grafaiai.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Orthworm's poor special bulk can often be taken advantage of by foes like Jolteon, Magneton, Vikavolt, and Clawitzer, though some of these Pokemon have to be wary of Body Press on the switch in.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Orthworm is an excellent defensive Pokemon thanks to its great physical bulk, Steel typing, and complementary immunity to Ground from Earth Eater. Common Pokemon like Snorlax, Sandslash, and Sandaconda struggle to break through Orthworm on their own, while other Pokemon like Grafaiai, Farigiraf, and Mesprit must either dedicate a coverage move for Orthworm or Terastallize. Orthworm's fantastic defensive profile gives it ample opportunities to switch in and set up entry hazards with Stealth Rock and Spikes for its teammates. Orthworm is also a resilient hazard setter against hazard removers like Sandslash and offensive Hisuian Avalugg. Heavy Slam has the best immediate power and coverage of Orthworm's attacks against foes like Grafaiai and Articuno, deals super effective damage to Froslass, and wrecks Whimsicott and Tera Fairy Pokemon such as Jolteon and Mesprit. Body Press is strong against Snorlax and Glastrier, and it 2HKOes heavier foes and foes that resist Heavy Slam such as Magneton, Hisuian Avalugg, and Jolteon. The increased resilience and additional power to Body Press provided by Iron Defense enable Orthworm to beat physical attackers like Brute Bonnet, set up on setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Floatzel and Curse Snorlax, and overwhelm physically defensive Pokemon such as Brute Bonnet and Regirock lacking Iron Defense. Orthworm can lean into its hazard setting capabilities by running Stealth Rock and Spikes, taking advantage of Choice item attackers like Mesprit and Grafaiai and accepting its own lack of longevity as a defensive Pokemon. Protect helps Orthworm maximize recovery from Leftovers and scout Choice item attackers like Passimian, Magneton, and Typhlosion. Tera Ghost makes Orthworm more secure against Fighting-type physical attacks like Close Combat from Passimian and Glastrier, Body Press from Regirock and opposing Orthworm, and Low Kick from Grafaiai. Tera Ghost also enables Orthworm to block Rapid Spin from Sandslash and Hisuian Avalugg to preserve the entry hazards it sets. Tera Electric leaves Orthworm without weaknesses, so it can more efficiently set hazards and take on physical attackers. Orthworm's EVs are tailored to patch up its lower special bulk to enable it to take on special attackers like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Whimsicott more comfortably while still giving it enough physical bulk to survive a +2 Low Kick from Grafaiai, Close Combat from Passimian, and 2 Low Kicks from Sneasel.</p> <p>Orthworm is a good fit for bulky offense teams looking for an entry hazard setter, and its limited longevity is a better fit for the playstyle compared to more passive hazard setters like Palossand and Sandaconda. Offensive Pokemon such as Charizard, Jolteon, and Typhlosion adore checks to them like Snorlax and Regirock taking residual damage from Orthworm's entry hazards. Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Sneasel commonly run Knock Off, which complements Orthworm's entry hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Palossand and Charizard and helping wear them down. Charizard can comfortably take Orthworm's attacks and threaten it out, so Orthworm appreciates support from partners like Snorlax, Floatzel, and Lanturn that can threaten Charizard and other Fire-types like Typhlosion. Hazard removers like Lurantis are appreciated by Orthworm because residual damage from Spikes racks up quickly on it and limits its defensive capabilities. Rapid Spin users like Sandslash, Hitmonlee, and Cryogonal remove entry hazards without removing Orthworm's entry hazards. Fighting-types like Virizion and Passimian can overpower Orthworm with their super effective STAB moves, so checks to them such as Mesprit, Charizard, and Weezing are appreciated. Orthworm is a great partner for Pokemon vulnerable to Ground-types such as Lanturn, Qwilfish, and Jolteon locked into Electric-type moves.</p>"

Furthermore, other foes like Hisuian Qwilfish, Mesprit, and Floatzel can often find it difficult to make progress against Orthworm without utilizing Terastallization. Iron Tail and Body Press cover much of the tier together, while Substitute lets Orthworm avoid burn from foes like Mismagius, and Weezing. Substitute also prevents Orthworm from being phazed by Dragon Tail from the likes of Dipplin and protects it from revenge killers like Passimian. Maximum Special Defense investment alongside a Careful nature helps Orthworm better withstand special attacks from foes like Jolteon, Lanturn, and Mismagius. Tera Ghost is used to help find setup opportunities against Fighting-types like Passimian and Virizion.</p> <p>Coil Orthworm pairs well with fast teammates like Jolteon and Hisuian Sneasel, which appreciate its ability to take advantage of Ground-type foes like Sandslash and Sandaconda. Other teammates like Lanturn, Articuno, and Typhlosion appreciate Orthworm's ability to use common checks like Arboliva and Snorlax as setup fodder. Opposing Fire-types can often be a significant struggle for Orthworm, so it appreciates teammates like Qwilfish, Floatzel, and Lanturn to check them. Without prior boosts, Orthworm can often have a rough time against opposing Fighting-types, so teammates like Whimsicott, Charizard, and Weezing can serve as invaluable support. Since Orthworm relies heavily on its Leftovers for its game plan, it appreciates Knock Off absorbers like Dipplin and Muk. Hazard support from teammates like Mesprit, Sandslash, and Palossand is often greatly appreciated to help weaken Orthworm's checks.</p>"

Tera Fighting beats Steel-types, hits Snorlax and Porygon2 harder and sooner than Stored Power can with limited boosts, and also flips Farigiraf's Dark and Bug weaknesses. A Weakness Policy on Stored Power sets can take advantage of weaker attacks like Knock Off and U-turn from Mesprit but is situational, tough to activate, and limits Farigiraf's longevity. Cud Chew, with a Sitrus Berry, can give Farigiraf more concentrated recovery than Leftovers, and, with a Lum Berry, it can help it more comfortably set up against Glare Sandaconda and Toxic Hisuian Qwilfish. Sap Sipper can provide Farigiraf with setup opportunities against Whimsicott and Shaymin locked into Grass-type moves. However, Armor Tail best enables Farigiraf as a sweeper by guarding it from priority moves. Farigiraf can run an offensive Trick Room set, though Alolan Exeggutor often does this role better because of its greater power and coverage. Farigiraf has other options in its movepool such as Future Sight, Wish, and Roar but struggles to support teams with its mediocre defensive typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hisuian Qwilfish, Brute Bonnet, and Malamar have enough special bulk to take a boosted hit from Farigiraf and retaliate with their Dark-type STAB moves, Sneasel outspeeds Farigiraf before an Agility and hits it hard with Knock Off, and Alolan Persian can Taunt Farigiraf before it can set up. Although Sableye and Spiritomb don't deal much damage to Farigiraf on their own, they can force it to exhaust Terastallization or totally counter it if it's no longer available.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Magneton, Orthworm, and Perrserker force Farigiraf to exhaust Tera in order to beat them if it lacks enough boosts for Stored Power, and Psyshock is particularly weak against their high Defense stats.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Snorlax, Porygon2, and Regirock can stomach Farigiraf's hits unless it's accumulated multiple boosts for Stored Power. Snorlax and Porygon2 take significant damage from a boosted Psyshock, though. Dipplin and Appletun can phaze Farigiraf with Dragon Tail; similarly, Articuno can use Haze to clear away Farigiraf's boosts or Roar to phaze it, and it has the bulk and recovery to repel Farigiraf repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: With Taunt, Oricorio-F and Mismagius can prevent Farigiraf from setting up, which is especially disruptive if Farigiraf lacks boosts and has Stored Power, and they can set up on it in return.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Farigiraf can reach great heights as a setup sweeper thanks to its great bulk and solid Special Attack. Psyshock hits specially bulky Pokemon such as Snorlax and Articuno and ignores Special Defense boosts on sweepers like Oricorio-F and Jolteon. As Farigiraf accumulates multiple boosts, though, Stored Power helps it become a taller order for teams to check, and it hits physically bulkier Pokemon like Regirock and Sandaconda harder. However, Stored Power provides less immediate damage for breaking teams and is more inflexible by requiring Farigiraf to spend multiple turns boosting. Farigiraf can effectively use Tera Blast as a STAB move to beat Dark-types like Brute Bonnet, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Sneasel. After Terastallizing, it transforms into Tera Blast Fire, which lets it beat Orthworm, Magneton, Spiritomb, and Tera Steel Pokemon like Rotom-C and Weezing. Armor Tail aids Farigiraf's sweep by denying priority attacks like Sucker Punch from Hisuian Brute Bonnet, Aqua Jet from Floatzel, and Ice Shard from Sneasel. Armor Tail also saves Farigiraf from being locked into its setup by Prankster Encore from Grafaiai, Whimsicott, and Sableye. Farigiraf can invest fully in its Special Attack to become immediately more threatening, potentially sweeping just off of Agility, but full investment in HP gives it better opportunities to use multiple setup moves; Psyshock is better tailored for sets with maximum Special Attack investment, compared to Stored Power, which works better on maximum HP sets where it can more comfortably accumulate multiple boosts.</p> <p>Farigiraf fits on hyper offensive teams as a setup sweeper. Fellow setup sweepers such as Virizion, Braviary, and Qwilfish greatly appreciate partnering with Farigiraf, given its positive matchups against Prankster disruptors like Grafaiai, Whimsicott, and Sableye. Powerful offensive partners like Glastrier, Virizion, and Typhlosion can break holes in teams for Farigiraf to more easily sweep. Farigiraf has to exhaust Terastallization in order to beat Spiritomb, so it appreciates partners that can deal with it, such as Whimsicott and Magneton. Hyper offense leads like Froslass and Hisuian Avalugg can set up entry hazards to help weaken foes like Regirock, Dipplin, and Hisuian Qwilfish to better enable Farigiraf to sweep. Orthworm is a tough target for Fargiraf to break on its own, so it appreciates help from Fire-type teammates like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Oricorio-F that can pressure it. Fighting-type partners like Passimian, Virizion, and Hitmonlee can handle Orthworm as well as another obstacle to Farigiraf in Poryygon2. Offensive partners like Magneton and Sandslash can pressure Hisuian Qwilfish for Farigiraf. Hisuian Sneasel is a standout partner for Farigiraf by checking all three aforementioned stops to it, Orthworm, Porygon2, and Hisuian Qwilfish, while Fargiraf pressures its defensive answers such as Weezing and Qwilfish.</p>"

  "Brute Bonnet": {
    "overview": "<p>Brute Bonnet is a menacing attacker in ZU thanks to a laundry list of highly useful offensive attributes. Brute Bonnet's STAB combination hits much of the tier for neutral damage, and it can utilize coverage moves to cover the few Pokemon that it can't, such as opposing Brute Bonnet, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Virizion. STAB Sucker Punch allows Brute Bonnet to cleave through weakened offensive teams late-game, and Synthesis in conjunction with its solid bulk makes Brute Bonnet difficult to chip down. Brute Bonnet is also capable of boosting its already high Attack stat with Booster Energy, making it a potent wincon, or by utilizing a Choice Band set, which turns it into a devastating wallbreaker. However, Brute Bonnet is burdened with a poor defensive typing, as it is weak to common Fighting-, Bug-, Ice-, and Poison-type attacks. Its poor Speed tier also leaves it very reliant on Sucker Punch to reliably threaten offensive teams, and they often carry Fighting-, Dark-, or Fairy-types that resist it. Brute Bonnet is capable of using Terastallization to circumvent these issues; however, this makes the standard offensive set Tera-dependent in many matchups. The Choice Band set can also be taken advantage of, as Brute Bonnet's STAB combination can be played around with common Pokemon that fit on both offensive and bulkier team styles, such as Dipplin, Virizion, and Charizard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Growth is Brute Bonnet's best boosting option; it is especially dangerous under sun, where Protosynthesis is activated and Growth grants +2 Attack. This makes Tera Dark set with Growth / Sucker Punch / Crunch / Close Combat with Dread Plate or Life Orb especially dangerous on sun teams, as Brute Bonnet becomes extremely powerful with these boosts and can break down defensive cores for its fellow sun sweepers, such as Leafeon, Scovillain, and Victreebel, to take advantage of. Growth sets can also be run outside of sun teams, but Brute Bonnet's power is much less impressive, and such a set tends to require significant support to be effective when not under sun. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit bulky Poison-types harder, most notably Weezing and Muk, but Close Combat's targets are generally more relevant. Tera Blast can be run on offensive sets utilizing Tera Poison to hit several of Brute Bonnet's traditional checks, including Virizion, Whimsicott, and Dipplin. Such sets should use Booster Energy in order to 2HKO Dipplin after Stealth Rock damage. This makes Brute Bonnet reliant on Terastallizing in almost every single game to be effective, however, and forces Brute Bonnet to drop Close Combat, which makes it vulnerable to threats such as Orthworm, Hisuian Avalugg, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Glastrier. Trailblaze can boost Brute Bonnet's Speed, but it is quite weak, and Brute Bonnet is still quite slow even after a boost. As a result, Sucker Punch is generally a more reliable way to take down faster threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most of the tier's Fighting-types are quite threatening to Brute Bonnet. Virizion, and Hisuian Sneasel all resist Brute Bonnet's STAB moves and threaten it heavily in return with their own Fighting-type STAB moves. Passimian easily outruns and threatens Brute Bonnet with both Close Combat and U-turn. Brute Bonnet can turn the tables on all of them by running Tera Poison, however.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Dipplin takes all of Brute Bonnet's attacks with ease and can phaze it with Dragon Tail. Weezing can chip Brute Bonnet down with Rocky Helmet and burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Both Qwilfish formes are also good checks, as Brute Bonnet fears their Poison-type STAB moves and struggles to take them down due to Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers</strong>: Dark-resistant foes that are faster than Brute Bonnet generally present problems for it, as it is reliant on Sucker Punch to threaten faster foes. Whimsicott takes Sucker Punch with ease and can threaten Brute Bonnet with Moonblast, U-turn, or Switcheroo. It can also cripple Brute Bonnet with Encore should it choose to Terastallize. Sneasel outruns Brute Bonnet and threatens to OHKO it with Triple Axel. While not weak to Sucker Punch, foes with certain setup options such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jolteon, Nasty Plot + Encore Mesprit, or Tera Fighting Quiver Dance Oricorio-F can force Brute Bonnet into an uncomfortable guessing game or, in the case of Mesprit, lock it into Sucker Punch and turn it into setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Any form of status is crippling to Brute Bonnet. Common foes such as Charizard, Porygon2, Qwilfish formes, and Spiritomb can all neuter Brute Bonnet with a debilitating status condition. Tera Poison makes Brute Bonnet immune to attempts by Qwilfish formes to poison it, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Crunch is generally preferred over Seed Bomb, as Dark is a superior offensive typing and hits more of the metagame for neutral damage. It notably hits Muk, Weezing, Dipplin, and Articuno harder, but keep in mind that Brute Bonnet will still need the latter three to be chipped if it hopes to break through them. Crunch also comes with a handy chance to drop Defense, which can be useful in a late-game situation when faced down with Dipplin or Tera Fairy Porygon2. However, Seed Bomb can be considered, as it hits Sandslash, Sandaconda, and Lanturn harder. Sucker Punch is mandatory, as Brute Bonnet is quite slow, and access to powerful priority allows it to become threatening to offensive builds. Close Combat provides crucial coverage against foes such as Orthworm, Glastrier, opposing Brute Bonnet, and Porygon2. It also hits Hisuian Qwilfish and Virizion neutrally, which is crucial, as they are among the few Pokemon that resist Brute Bonnet's STAB attacks. Synthesis allows Brute Bonnet to stay healthy throughout a match and allows it to potentially outlast defensive Pokemon that try to beat it with consistent chip damage, such as Snorlax, Sandaconda, and Naclstack. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Brute Bonnet to come in multiple times throughout a game without fear of chip from entry hazards; this makes it quite challenging to take down in conjunction with Synthesis. On the other hand, Booster Energy gives Brute Bonnet a one-time boost to its Attack, which makes it a very threatening late-game wincon. Notably, it allows Sucker Punch to OHKO Jolteon after Stealth Rock damage while significantly improving damage rolls against crucial targets such as Grafaiai and Floatzel. Booster Energy can only be used once, however, which restricts Brute Bonnet's flexibility throughout a game. Tera Poison is the preferred Tera type, as it grants Brute Bonnet a resistance to Fighting-, Bug-, Poison-, and Fairy-type attacks. This allows it to turn the tables on several of its traditional checks, such as Qwilfish and Passimian. Tera Water can also be used to give Brute Bonnet a resistance to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, letting it deal with Sneasel, Glastrier, and Typhlosion. An Adamant nature is run for maximum damage output.</p> <p>Brute Bonnet's powerful attacks and access to Sucker Punch give it a solid place on many balance and offensive teams. Do note that it is best to use teammates that are not reliant on Terastallizing to perform their roles consistently, as Brute Bonnet often needs to Terastallize if it is looking to sweep late-game. Brute Bonnet benefits from teammates that help to chip down its offensive answers into range of its powerful Sucker Punch. Fast pivots such as Passimian, Jolteon, Floatzel, and Grafaiai can help chip much of the offensive metagame, and Brute Bonnet also appreciates their ability to get it in safely. On the other hand, physically bulky teammates such as Weezing, Palossand, and Sandaconda check Fighting-types like Passimian and Primeape. All three also run Rocky Helmet, which is great to further chip physical attackers like Sneasel, Hisuian Sneasel, and Virizion. The latter two also set Stealth Rock to chip down Brute Bonnet's offensive answers even further. Two of Brute Bonnet's best and most common answers are Charizard and Whimsicott, so special walls such as Porygon2 and Snorlax help by checking these big threats. Brute Bonnet pairs well with other powerful wallbreakers, such as Magneton, Floatzel, and Glastrier, as they can help to break down each other's defensive answers; the former two can also pivot to get Brute Bonnet in safely.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Brute Bonnet uses its great STAB combination, good overall coverage, and sizable bulk to become an effective wallbreaker. Close Combat allows Brute Bonnet to hit foes such as Orthworm, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Virizion hard. Sucker Punch allows Brute Bonnet to revenge kill dangerous offensive threats such as Floatzel, Magneton, and Typhlosion in an emergency. However, it should be used with caution, as being locked into Sucker Punch is very undesirable due to how easily it can be exploited by the opponent. Tera Dark gives Crunch a significant power boost, giving Brute Bonnet the ability to 2HKO bulky foes such as Weezing, Orthworm, and physically defensive Qwilfish after Stealth Rock. Tera Fighting, however, can be used as an alternative to power up Close Combat, allowing it to OHKO Virizion and 2HKO defensive Hisuian Qwilfish after Stealth Rock. An Adamant nature is required to give Brute Bonnet as much power as possible.</p> <p>Choice Band Brute Bonnet fits best on bulky offense and balance teams. Brute Bonnet tends to invite in threats such as Virizion, Passimian, and Whimsicott to attempt a revenge kill. Bulky Poison-types such as Weezing, Qwilfish, and Muk are therefore standout partners, as they can help stave off these threats. Brute Bonnet complements them by coming in on Ground- and Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Palossand and Mesprit, which offensive teammates such as Hisuian Sneasel and Jolteon appreciate as well. Dipplin is another great teammate that can help out against most physical revenge killers. A specially bulky teammate, such as Porygon2, Mesprit, or Lanturn, can help stave off revenge killing attempts from the likes of Charizard, Typhlosion, and Magneton; the last two also help Brute Bonnet get in safely with their slow pivot moves, while the first two can set Stealth Rock or spread status for Brute Bonnet to take advantage of. Brute Bonnet is also quite slow, and it benefits from VoltTurn partners that can get it in safely. It therefore loves faster pivoting teammates, such as Jolteon, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Choice Scarf Floatzel, that can help it overcome the shortcoming of its low Speed. These teammates appreciate Brute Bonnet's wallbreaking capabilities facilitating a potential late-game sweep. Brute Bonnet hates being statused, so teammates that can absorb attempts to burn and paralyze it, such as Naclstack, Typhlosion, and Lanturn are appreciated. It also appreciates paralysis being spread onto the opposing team, as teams can take advantage of its poor Speed tier. As such, teammates like Porygon2, Lanturn, and Sandaconda make for good partners.</p>"

Tera Water eliminates its Ice weakness and defensively answers Floatzel and Glastrier, but it does not fix Dipplin's vulnerability to Articuno's Freeze-Dry and worsens its matchups against Virizion and Brute Bonnet, physical attackers that it would otherwise check.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Whimsicott</strong>: The Grass / Fairy typing leaves Whimsicott barely scratched by Dipplin's Giga Drain and immune to Dragon Tail. Even without Choice Specs, Whimsicott has a 93.4% chance to 2HKO Dipplin with Moonblast. Even if Dipplin Terastallizes, pivot Whimsicott sets can lock Dipplin into a non-damaging move with Encore and whittle it down.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Articuno 2HKOes Dipplin with Freeze-Dry, has great bulk and Roost, can remove Dipplin's boosts with Haze or Roar if it Terastallizes, and can PP stall Dipplin with Pressure. Cryogonal has Freeze-Dry, recovery, and Haze similar to Articuno but isn't as bulky. Sneasel, Glastrier, and Hisuian Avalugg overcome Dipplin's massive Defense by exploiting its 4x Ice weakness, but Dipplin Terastallizing sours their positive matchups against it. Choice Band Floatzel 2HKOes Dipplin with Ice Spinner.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Charizard 2HKOes Dipplin with Hurricane and can switch in while Dipplin uses Growth, Recover, or Giga Drain. Oricorio-F similarly 2HKOes Dipplin with Hurricane, threatens to set up on Dipplin with Quiver Dance, and can Taunt Dipplin. Braviary can use Bulk Up and Brave Bird to power through Dipplin while avoiding Dragon Tail with Substitute. Dodrio can cut through Dipplin's physical bulk if it gains a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Choice Specs Jolteon 2HKOes Dipplin with Alluring Voice. Shaymin can exploit the Special Defense drops from Seed Flare and one of its coverage moves to break through Dipplin, and it has the bulk to take boosted hits from Dipplin. Alolan Exeggutor takes a big chunk of damage from Dragon Tail but can switch in on Recover, Growth, or Giga Drain and exploit the negative priority of Dragon Tail to blow Dipplin away with Draco Meteor. Vikavolt 2HKOes Dipplin with Bug Buzz and can comfortably take attacks from Dipplin. Clawitzer must be wary of Giga Drain but has a 68.8% chance to OHKO Dipplin with a Choice Specs-boosted Dragon Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Tera Fairy Users</strong>: Dipplin's dependence on Dragon Tail to phaze setup sweepers makes it setup fodder for Tera Fairy users like Nasty Plot Mesprit, Calm Mind Jolteon, and Mismagius. Snorlax must fish for paralysis with Body Slam but can overcome Dipplin in the long run with luck.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Dipplin relies on its Eviolite for its bulk and is vulnerable to damaging entry hazards, which force it to use its limited Recover more often and become more passive. Toxic from Qwilfish formes, Muk, and Toedscruel puts Dipplin on a timer and prevents it from gaining enough boosts to sweep. Even burns from switching into ideal foes like Palossand hurt Dipplin's longevity and dampen the power of its Dagon Tail. Weezing can fish for a poison on Dipplin with Sludge Bomb, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and wash away its boosts with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Phazing</strong>: Weezing, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Muk can wipe Dipplin's boosts with Haze and threaten it with their Poison-type STAB moves, and they have the bulk to take even boosted hits from Dipplin.</p> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Sableye can switch in as Dipplin sets up and lock it into a non-damaging move like Growth or Recover. Even if Dipplin Terastallizes to improve its matchups against them, Mesprit and Grafaiai can still disrupt it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dipplin is a fantastic check to physical attackers like Regirock and Passimian thanks to its substantial physical bulk and ability to absorb Knock Off. Dipplin's walling capabilities give it many opportunities to set up Growth against passive or ineffective foes like Sandaconda and Brute Bonnet to function as a bulky sweeper. Dragon Tail phazes setup sweepers that might try to break through Dipplin such as Snorlax, Virizion, and Malamar. Giga Drain keeps Dipplin healthy as it attacks to make it less reliant on Recover to quickly devour Pokemon weak to Grass like Regirock, Palossand, and Sandaconda. Sticky Hold distinguishes Dipplin from other NFE Pokemon dependent on their Eviolite such as Hisuian Qwilfish and Porygon2 by protecting Dipplin from Knock Off, Switcheroo, and Trick from users like Grafaiai and Mesprit. Tera Poison improves Dipplin's matchups against Fighting-types like Hisuian Sneasel, allowing it to maintain good matchups against Poison-types like Grafaiai and Hisuian Qwilfish as well as an immunity to poison at the cost of vulnerability to Mesprit and Farigiraf. Tera Fairy protects Dipplin from being phazed by Dragon Tail from opposing Dipplin and Appletun, and it improves Dipplin's vulnerability to Alolan Exeggutor and Appletun. Tera Steel turns the tables against checks like Glastrier, Sneasel, and Tera Fairy Mesprit and protects Dipplin from poison from Grafaiai, the Qwilfish formes, and Muk at the cost of worsening its matchups against Fighting-types.</p> <p>Dipplin's capability to absorb Knock Off makes it a great partner to Pokemon that are reliant on their items, including Articuno, Regirock, and Hisuian Qwilfish. Snorlax is an excellent partner to handle threats to Dipplin like Articuno, Typhlosion, and Charizard, and Dipplin takes physical attacks and Knock Off from Poliwrath, Passimian, and Sandslash for Snorlax in return. Dipplin amplifies residual damage from entry hazard stacking thanks to Dragon Tail, so hazard setters like Hisuian Qwilfish, Orthworm, Qwilfish, and Sandslash have great synergy with Dipplin. Knock Off users like Mesprit, Passimian, and Grafaiai can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes to ensure they take damage from entry hazards when Dipplin uses Dragon Tail. Teammates weak to Water and Grass like Regirock, Sandaconda, and Sandslash appreciate Dipplin taking on Floatzel, Brute Bonnet, Lanturn, and Virizion for them. Teammates like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Orthworm can handle special attackers with Fairy- and Ice-type coverage for Dipplin, offensively checking Whimsicott and Articuno. Regirock and Naclstack help Dipplin by defensively answering Flying-types like Dodrio, Charizard, and Oricorio-F for it. Dipplin is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by chip damage from hazards, so it depends on partners with hazard removal like Sandslash and Hitmontop to mitigate this vulnerability.</p>"
