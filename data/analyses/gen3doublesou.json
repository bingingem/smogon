However, it hits noticeably weaker than Tyranitar and is reliant on support from Marowak's Lightning Rod to keep it safe from Thunderbolt from Raikou, Zapdos, and Gengar and requires multiple Dragon Dance boosts to deal serious damage. It should be noted that this is difficult to pull off consistently due to the tier's fast pace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earthquake is powerful spread damage, but takes a few Dragon Dance boosts to become truly scary. It OHKOes Raikou at +1 Attack and Tyranitar and Metagross at +2.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hidden Power Flying gives Gyarados a strong STAB attack, KOing Gengar and Sceptile at +1 and Starmie at +2 Attack. Hidden Power Rock is an option to hit Zapdos, but it will only OHKO at +2 Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gyarados requires an Adamant nature to always OHKO 252 HP Metagross with a +2 Earthquake, though a Jolly nature will allow it to outspeed the rarely-seen Aerodactyl after a single Dragon Dance boost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lum Berry temporarily keeps Gyarados safe from any Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp it might draw in to halt its attempts to sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lightning Rod Marowak is an absolute requirement for Gyarados, as most teams will have either an Electric-type like Raikou and Zapdos or Electric coverage like Thunderbolt on Gengar. Metagross, Steelix, and Thunderbolt-less Gengar can really only pressure Gyarados with Explosion, so pairing it with Gengar or multiple Protect users to block incoming Explosion will be helpful. Redirection support from Mr. Mime and Magmar will also go a long way in supporting its Dragon Dance sweep. Snorlax appreciates Gyarados's Intimidate and helps it out by checking Raikou and Zapdos thanks to its superb special bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, it is reliant on a Choice Band to do any serious damage, and it still comes up shy of OHKOing Pokemon like Metagross and Tyranitar that threaten to OHKO it back.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earthquake is Aerodactyl's best attack, as it OHKOes Raikou and 2HKOes Tyranitar, Metagross, and Steelix. Common Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Gengar, are 2HKOed by Hidden Power Rock, while Zapdos is OHKOed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Double-Edge is a strong and spammable move for Aerodactyl to use freely and not worry about recoil thanks to Rock Head. Notably, it is Aerodactyl's strongest attack against bulky waters like Suicune and Swampert. Aerial Ace OHKOes Sceptile, but most other Pokemon in the tier are hit harder by a different attack. Rock Slide has a pitiful damage output, but it is a spread move that can hit Flying-types and Levitate users while also having the ability to flinch. Hyper Beam is a last-ditch, high damage option that can be used in desperate situations to get a powerful attack off before it faints.</p> </li> <li> <p>The given EV Spread allows Aerodactyl to survive a Thunderbolt from Gengar while outspeeding Sceptile and Alakazam, making it the fastest viable Pokemon in the tier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aerodactyl is best saved for late-game, where it can act as a cleaner or as a revenge killer on weakened fast Pokemon like Raikou and Gengar. Locking into the wrong move can be costly, especially if locking into Earthquake, as it can be easily punished by Ground-immune foes switching in. It is important to note that Aerodactyl really isn't that strong and comes up short if its foes haven't taken any chip damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aerodactyl needs to be paired with multiple Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Gengar, Gyarados, and Zapdos, in order to freely spam Earthquake. Swampert and Snorlax make good partners with Aerodactyl for their ability to check Electric-types as well as Tyranitar, while Aerodactyl provides a Ground-immune partner for them to use Earthquake with.</p> </li> </ul>"

Its powerful attacks, especially Self-Destruct, also allow it to command a strong offensive presence at all times.</p> </li> <li> <p>Return is Snorlax's safest STAB attack, useful for strongly hitting Water-types like Swampert and Starmie in addition to Zapdos and Sceptile. Double-Edge offers more power but chips into Snorlax's HP, diminishing its bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earthquake hits Normal-resistant foes like Metagross and Tyranitar. This, coupled with Shadow Ball for Gengar, gives it perfect coverage into the metagame, hitting all viable Pokemon for at least Neutral damage. Brick Break can be used over Earthquake to OHKO Tyranitar, which Earthquake fails to do.</p> </li> <li> <p>Snorlax's Self-Destruct is one of the strongest attacks in the metagame and will OHKO even the bulkiest of neutral targets, such as Swampert and Suicune, if attacking without any damage reduction. If it can pull off the attack successfully, it will decimate the opponent's side of the field.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protect can be used on Snorlax to allow it to scout for Explosion from foes or accumulate more Leftovers recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lum Berry shields Snorlax from Will-O-Wisp burns and paralysis from Thunder Wave. Choice Band makes Snorlax's attacks even more devastating, allowing its Self-Destruct to OHKO even Normal-resistant foes like Tyranitar and Metagross. Leftovers allows Snorlax to recover some of its HP, amplifying its excellent bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EV Spread allows Snorlax to 2HKO Zapdos with Return while investing heavily into physical bulk, allowing it to be 3HKOed by Metagross's Meteor Mash.</p> </li> <li> <p>Snorlax appreciates Intimidate users such as Tauros and Arcanine to make up for its lower Defense stat. Arcanine also pressures Metagross with Overheat, which is appreciated, since Snorlax is threatened by Metagross's Meteor Mash and Explosion. Faster Pokemon like Raikou, Tauros, Gengar, and Raikou make up for Snorlax's pitifully low Speed, as it ties Steelix as the slowest viable Pokemon in the tier. Gengar is a vital partner for Snorlax, as it can safely use Self-Destruct without having to force its partner to use Protect.</p> </li> </ul>"
