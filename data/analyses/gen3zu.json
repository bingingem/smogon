Paired with its above-average Speed tier, it is a frightening lead, particularly versus slower leads like Snorunt, Cyndaquil, and Spoink. Sleep Powder's nigh-perfect accuracy allows Butterfree to put switch-ins or opposing leads to sleep, which makes them deadweight for most of the game. Psychic is Butterfree's strongest move, and thanks to the rarity of viable Dark- and Steel-types, it is almost drawback-free. Hidden Power Grass allows Butterfree to OHKO offensive Rhyhorn while also threatening Ground-types such as Cubone and Water-types like Seaking and Staryu. Giga Drain is an option to provide Butterfree a form of recovery that helps complement Morning Sun's low PP, though it also has low PP and is weaker. Morning Sun provides Butterfree with reliable recovery and allows it to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Butterfree can opt to use Stun Spore alongside Sleep Powder in order to neuter faster threats such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Elekid. If Stun Spore is used over Morning Sun, Butterfree appreciates the limited recovery that Leftovers and Giga Drain provide.</p> <p>Butterfree fits best on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate the free turns that Sleep Powder provides. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves, such as Spoink, Seaking, and Chinchou, pair up nicely with Butterfree. Chinchou is worth noting due to its additional resistances to Ice and Electric. Its access to Thunder Wave means Butterfree's team can also spread status more easily. Wallbreakers such as Aipom, Castform, and Elekid all appreciate the opportunity to switch in on sleeping Pokemon. Aipom can act as an offensive pivot for Butterfree, as it threatens Butterfree's checks with Double-Edge and Brick Break. Likewise, Castform is worth mentioning, as it can tank special moves from Butterfree's checks and deal heavy damage in return. Setup sweepers such as Croconaw, Growlithe, Cubone, and Spoink appreciate the setup opportunity that Sleep Powder and Stun Spore provides them. Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyhorn, Aron, Magnemite, and Nosepass can switch into the STAB moves of faster physical attackers that threaten Butterfree such as Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Aipom.</p>"

Nosepass can also trap and remove opposing Magnemite, another prominent Butterfree check. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves such as Growlithe, Seaking, and Spoink all make good partners. Growlithe is able to act as a wallbreaker with Overheat making it a great partner.

This allows Cyndaquil to beat leads that would otherwise outspeed and OHKO it, such as Aipom, although it must be careful of paralysis. Fire Blast threatens leads such as Snorunt with an OHKO and packs a huge punch with Blaze active, 2HKOing specially bulky Pokemon such as Delcatty and Grimer. It can even 2HKO some Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Staryu and Chinchou. Hidden Power Grass hits Water- and Rock-types that resist Fire Blast such as Seaking and Rhyhorn.

Cyndaquil's presence as a lead has seen several counter-leads emerge, such as Spoink and Seaking, both relatively bulky Pokemon that can set up on Cyndaquil — ; using Calm Mind and Rain Dance, respectively.

Physical attackers such as Pidgeotto, Aipom, and Cubone can threaten special walls such as Delcatty and Dustox for Masquerain. These physical attackers also threaten Substitute + Calm Mind Spoink, which otherwise turns Masquerain into setup fodder. Dustox makes for a fantastic partner; it can phaze out Spoink with Whirlwind while walling special attackers that threaten Masquerain, such as Elekid and Chinchou. It's also a more reliable check to Koffing, which helps prevent Masquerain from being statused. If Masquerain lacks Ice Beam, Pokemon that can threaten Grass-types such as Growlithe, Pidgeotto, and Seaking are appreciated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to great mixed bulk, an acceptable defensive typing, and an incredible suite of utility moves, Delcatty is a staple cleric of the tier and excellent choice for any team needing a solid backbone and support Pokemon. Wish differentiates Delcatty from other walls and other bulky Normal-types like Castform thanks to the amount of support it provides. Protect allows Delcatty to safely receive its own Wish, as well as accrue additional Leftovers recovery and scout the intentions of Choice Band users such as Aipom. Body Slam is a solid damaging move when bolstered by STAB and a 30% paralysis rate, which ensures that Delcatty isn't too passive when checking threats. Heal Bell allows Delcatty to remove status from itself and its teammates. This is particularly important if Delcatty is afflicted with Toxic, since it must spend 2 turns on the field to heal itself. Shadow Ball is an option to lure Shuppet, which would otherwise take advantage of Delcatty's passiveness. Hidden Power Grass hits Rhyhorn, which easily switches into Delcatty, but it can also hit the other Rock-types that don't mind Body Slam, such as Onix and Larvitar. However, Hidden Power Grass is easily ignored by Lileep, the most common Rock-type in the tier. Maximum HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature is used so Delcatty can reliably switch into special attackers, but a Sassy nature is preferred if Delcatty uses Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Delcatty is best used on defensive and balance teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check the many special attackers in the tier while also providing Wish and other utility. Lileep and Koffing are excellent physically defensive complements to Delcatty, checking many attackers that try to hit Delcatty on its frailer side, such as Aipom, Rhyhorn, and Pidgeotto. Lileep also particularly appreciates Heal Bell support, as Toxic is a very consistent way to break past Lileep and is splashed into the movesets of many Pokemon otherwise walled by Lileep. Wallbreakers are important on balance to help offset Delcatty's passivity. Rhyhorn is a more aggressive Normal-resistant Pokemon that becomes monstrously dangerous when supported by paralysis from Delcatty's Body Slam, and it can even come back for additional rounds of terror if restored by Wish and/or Heal Bell. Seaking and Castform are two great Pokemon that don't necessarily need support to wallbreak but appreciate Wish and cleric support for additional longevity. Other Pokemon with strong defensive qualities but no reliable recovery, such as Aron, Magnemite, and Chinchou, can stick around to fulfill their functions for much longer when they are kept alive by Wish. While the support Delcatty brings is unparalleled in the tier, it can be quite passive in the face of setup threats unafraid of Body Slam, such as Lum Berry users and Rock- and Steel-types using Substitute like Magnemite. Partnering Delcatty with good answers to these tactics, such as Koffing and Bayleef respectively, will make Delcatty much more reliable. Koffing is a terrific counter to offensive Rhyhorn and can use Explosion to check setup sweepers that might try to use Delcatty as an opportunity to run away with the game, such as Lum Berry Bagon. Bayleef's good mixed bulk allows it to duel Rock-types, Shuppet, and Magnemite that try to use Substitute against Delcatty, and either spread Toxic or chip away with Leech Seed.</p>"

Access to Thunderbolt and Ice Beam complete the legendary BoltBeam coverage, giving it the ability to hit a wide range of Pokemon super effectively, such as Bayleef, Lileep, and Seaking. Rest allows Delcatty to set up with impunity against walls reliant on status, such as Lileep and Dustox, allowing Delcatty to checkmate more passive teams if their phazer is KOed or Delcatty is the last Pokemon remaining.</p> <p>Calm Mind Delcatty is best used as a cleaner on balance teams, leveraging its bulk to slowly push through a weakened team, but appreciating the defensive backbone a balance team provides. Lileep is a great partner, blanket checking a huge portion of the metagame and spreading Toxic to soften the opposition. Wallbreakers like Aipom, Castform, and Seaking do an excellent job of removing or heavily damaging Pokemon that carry tools that can disrupt Delcatty's sweep. For example, Aipom can force big damage on Koffing, which carries Explosion, while Seaking can lure Whirlwind Dustox and threaten it with Hidden Power Rock. In the case that Delcatty comes up short late-game, other cleaners like Elekid and Horsea do a great job at picking up the pieces for Delcatty. Delcatty struggles into physical wallbreakers such as Aipom or Cubone that threaten to 2HKO or 3HKO Delcatty on the turn it Rests, so physically resilient Pokemon like Koffing, Lileep, and Bayleef are solid defensive partners for Delcatty.</p>"

  "Castform": {
    "outdated": true,
    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>A physical wallbreaker set utilizing Choice Band is an option, though this is largely outclassed by Choice Band Aipom. Toxic can be used to catch potential switch-ins off guard, such as Lileep; however, this means Castform has to forego Protect or one of its coverage options. Castform also has some set-specific options. Castform's Tank set may use Hidden Power Grass to OHKO Rhyhorn, but the coverage of Ice Beam is important to target Lileep. On Substitute mixed attacker Castform, Ice Beam can be used over Hidden Power Grass, as it still 2HKOes Rhyhorn while threatening Lileep with a 3HKO, though Hidden Power Grass OHKOing Rhyhorn is generally more useful.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Status Users</strong>: Pokemon that run status such as Butterfree, Lileep, and Koffing can all severely limit Castform's effectiveness. Toxic discourages Castform from using Double-Edge or Protect and greatly reduces its opportunities to switch in. Will-O-Wisp does the same while also halving Castform's Attack, effectively voiding its capabilities as a mixed wallbreaker since it can no longer threaten special walls.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: If Castform lacks Fire-type coverage it cannot threaten Magnemite, which can cripple Castform with a status move or 3HKO it with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: If Castform lacks Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Grass, it has a harder time dealing with Water-types, such as Seaking, Horsea, and Staryu. Staryu deserves a special mention, as it can slowly wear down Castform through its own recoil, healing off Double-Edge damage with Recover. Additionally, the lack of super effective coverage means Horsea can usually withstand at least one attack from Castform at full HP, which lets it fire off Hydro Pump multiple times.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Aipom, Taillow, and Pidgeotto outpace Castform and 2HKO it with their STAB moves. If it lacks Ice Beam or Hidden Power Grass, Castform is unable to threaten Rhyhorn. Cubone can KO Castform after the slightest amount of chip, while Castform can only 2HKO with Ice Beam and Double-Edge if Cubone is healthy.</p>",

It excels as a specially defensive tank that can threaten a wide variety of Pokemon. Furthermore, Forecast makes Castform the most reliable answer to teams that use weather, letting it automatically resist a majority of their primary moves. Protect allows Castform to scout would-be revenge killers that use Choice Band, such as Aipom and Pidgeotto, while also netting recovery from Leftovers. Castform's STAB Double-Edge removes Pokemon that resist its coverage, such as Chinchou and Elekid, while threatening special walls such as Dustox, Delcatty, and Sunflora. Thunderbolt allows Castform to nail Water- and Flying-types such as Horsea, Seaking, and Pidgeotto. Ice Beam enables Castform to threaten Ground- and Grass-types such as Rhyhorn and physically defensive Lileep. Flamethrower is an option to threaten Magnemite, but it requires Castform to forgo Thunderbolt, which limits its effectiveness against rain teams. Castform's EVs allow it to outpace maximum Speed Rhyhorn while still maintaining enough Attack to threaten special attackers such as Growlithe, Elekid, and Seaking. Castform's Special Defense investment allows it to avoid 2HKOs by Seaking, Horsea, and Cyndaquil, and possibly Growlithe with favorable Fire Blast damage.</p> <p>Castform excels on balance and offensive teams that appreciate an answer to weather or a special sponge. Physical wallbreakers such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Taillow appreciate Castform's effectiveness against Elekid. Special attackers such as Growlithe, Elekid, and Staryu enjoy the pressure that Castform puts on special walls like Dustox and Delcatty with Double-Edge. Elekid pairs particularly well with Castform, as it is able to threaten physical wallbreakers such as Aipom and Pidgeotto. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Castform preforms best with secondary defensive support from Pokemon such as Dustox, Delcatty, and Sunflora. Delcatty provides Castform with recovery in Wish while also keeping it safe from status thanks to Heal Bell. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Lileep, Koffing, and Magnemite prevent Castform from being revenge killed by Aipom, Pidgeotto, or Taillow. Koffing and Castform form a great core, as Koffing can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, while Castform can tank special attacks for Koffing.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Castform's exceptional bulk and special attack, fantastic special movepool, and ability in Forecast allow it to function as an excellent weather setter and wallbreaker. Under rain or sun its boosted STAB move 2HKOes nearly every viable special wall and OHKOes virtually every other neutral target. If it's using Rain Dance, Castform's only viable STAB move is Weather Ball, but if it's using Sunny Day, Castform may use Fire Blast instead, which is strong even outside of sun and still does more damage than Weather Ball in sun at the cost of imperfect accuracy. If it's using Rain Dance, Ice Beam is crucial for targeting Grass-types while also threatening Flying- and Ground-types outside of rain. When using Sunny Day, Solar Beam is used instead, as it OHKOes most Rock- and Water-types, which can usually tank a boosted Fire Blast and try to threaten Castform with their STAB moves and status. Castform's moveset is rounded off by Thunderbolt, which threatens opposing Water-types regardless of the weather and is Sunny Day Castform's strongest attack against Flash Fire Growlithe. Rain Dance has the option to instead use Thunder, which is even stronger at the cost of having shaky accuracy outside of rain, or Hidden Power Grass, which threatens Chinchou, a Pokemon that otherwise resists or is immune to all of Castform's attacks when used in rain. Mystic Water or Charcoal can be used to augment the power of Castform's STAB move, notably hitting special walls, such as Delcatty and Dustox, harder and 2HKOing the rare specially defensive Lileep. A Lum Berry can be used instead to prevent Castform from being crippled by status.</p> <p>Castform fits best on offensive teams looking for a powerful wallbreaker. Specifically, it is a fantastic option on dedicated weather teams, as it's among their best setters and one of their only answers to the other weather due to Forecast. On dedicated rain teams, Swift Swim users, such as Seaking and Horsea, and Rain setters, such as Voltorb, make great partners. On dedicated sun teams, Chlorophyll users, such as Exeggcute and Sunflora, and sun setters, such as Onix, are essential partners. On all types of offensive teams, fast physical threats such as Aipom and Taillow appreciate Castform's ability to break physical walls, while they in return can break through the remainder of the opposing team. Fast physical attackers are also Castform's biggest threat, as they can revenge kill it, so physical tanks and walls, such as Rhyhorn and Nosepass, also make great partners.</p>"

Both moves handle Flying-types such as Taillow and Pidgeotto. Hidden Power Grass rounds off Castform's coverage by threatening Chinchou while also preventing specially defensive Rhyhorn from attempting to tank a hit and retaliate. Alternatively, Fire Blast can be used to threaten Dustox and Magnemite, which otherwise wall this set.</p> <p>This set fits best on offensive and balance teams looking for a powerful and bulky special wallbreaker. Special walls that don't fear its coverage, such as Delcatty, wall it completely, so strong physical wallbreakers such as Aipom and Taillow make great partners, and Castform handles the physical walls they dislike in return. If it's running Fire Blast, Grass-types are important partners for their ability to break through Chinchou. Even if Castform is running Hidden Power Grass, it still appreciates their support. Psychic-types are notable partners for their ability to threaten specially defensive Poison-types like Dustox and Grimer, which Castform struggles to break through. Exeggcute is noteworthy for having both Grass- and Psychic-type STAB moves while also spreading sleep, which makes it easier for Castform to set up a Substitute. Fire-types like Cyndaquil and Growlithe pair well with Castform's coverage and break through Dustox and Magnemite for it, which is essential if it's running Hidden Power Grass. Physical walls and tanks, like Nosepass, Rhyhorn and Lileep, are also greatly appreciated, as faster physical wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Taillow, can easily revenge kill Castform, and the former can even survive all of Castform's attacks moves when at full HP. Finally, Forecast and Castform's good bulk make it the best weather answer, and this set's coverage often lets it handle weather sweepers for teams that would otherwise struggle with them.</p>"

Alternatively, Double-Edge can be used to increase Castform's damage at the cost of hurting its longevity. Flamethrower threatens Magnemite, Aron, and physically bulky Grass-types, such as Exeggcute and Bayleef. Hidden Power Grass threatens Rock-types, notably annihilating the exceptionally dangerous Rhyhorn. A Naughty nature allows Castform to increase the power of its STAB moves without compromising its Special Attack or Speed but it worsens Castform's matchups against special attackers like Elekid and Staryu. A Lonely nature can be used to check those threats, preserving those matchups at the cost of worsening Castform's matchups against physical attackers like Aipom and Taillow.</p> <p>Castform best fits on offensive and balance teams that appreciate it checking a wide range of Pokemon. Lileep is the one wall this set cannot threaten at all, and thus Toxic support from the likes of Dustox and Koffing is greatly appreciated. Fast physical attackers, such as Choice Band Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Taillow, can easily outspeed and revenge kill Castform if it's not behind a Substitute, and thus physically defensive Pokemon such as Lileep and Rhyhorn can help Castform fight off these threats. Special walls such as Dustox and Delcatty are also good partners if this Castform is using a Naughty nature, as it's easily put into range of faster special attackers such as Elekid and Staryu. Given this Castform's ability to break through special walls, additional special attackers such as Chinchou and Growlithe form potent offensive cores alongside it. Finally, Forecast lets this Castform check weather sweepers for its team, but it cannot be a team's sole weather check due to its lack of strong coverage, especially if it's running a Naughty nature.</p>"

Earthquake provides Mankey with a more accurate option against Fire-types like Growlithe and Cyndaquil and Electric-types such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Elekid. Mankey is able to outspeed the previous two and is able to avoid being OHKOed by Elekid's Thunderbolt while at full health. Rock Slide threatens Dustox and Flying-types like Pidgeotto, Tailow, and Delibird that may try to switch in on an Earthquake. Because of the sheer amount of switches Mankey forces, Focus Punch is a viable option, allowing it to heavily damage or OHKO would be switch-ins like Bayleef. Vital Spirit provides Mankey with an opportunity to switch into Butterfree on a Sleep Powder; however, Mankey Speed ties with maximum Speed Butterfree and gets OHKOed by Psychic if it loses the tie.</p> <p>Mankey excels on balance and offense teams that need a dedicated offensive Lileep check. Normal-types such as Pidgeotto, Aipom, and offensive Castform, as well as Petaya Berry Butterfree, appreciate Mankey being able to remove Lileep for them. Special attackers such as Chinchou, Elekid, Growlithe, and Staryu can remove Koffing, which otherwise completely walls Mankey. Dustox makes a great partner, as it walls Koffing and can threaten it with Psychic. Because of its poor bulk, Mankey struggles with faster attackers such as Elekid, so Pokemon with access to Thunder Wave such as Aipom, Nosepass, and Magnemite pair well with it. Utility Aipom appreciates how much Mankey threatens Lileep, which it otherwise struggles to remove due to its lack of Choice Band. Additionally, Nosepass also makes for a great partner, as its excellent bulk makes it an excellent pivot for Mankey into faster attackers like Pidgeotto. Special walls such as Delcatty, Sunflora, and Grimer can shut down special attackers that Mankey can't outspeed such as Elekid, Staryu, and Butterfree.</p>"

These aspects alongside a Salac Berry and its access to Reversal allow Mankey to act as a frightening late-game sweeper. Substitute allows Mankey to avoid status while also providing it with a reliable way to activate its Salac Berry. STAB-boosted Reversal, when at full power, OHKOes almost every Pokemon that doesn't resist Fighting bar Bayleef. Earthquake provides Mankey with an option to hit Pokemon without relying on a weakened Reversal. It also threatens Poison-types that resist Reversal such as Grimer and Dustox while also threatening Shuppet, which is otherwise immune to Fighting. Bulk Up allows Mankey to function outside of or in conjunction with its Salac Berry as a setup sweeper. The most notable instance of this is allowing it to 2HKO Dustox with Earthquake at +2. Additionally, at +1, Mankey has a chance to OHKO Bayleef with a full-power Reversal.</p> <p>Mankey fits best on bulky offense and balance builds that require a late-game sweeper. Koffing is Mankey's biggest threat because of its resistance to Reversal as well as its immunity to Earthquake, so Pokemon that can threaten it such as Dustox, Magnemite, and Staryu all pair well with it. Physical walls such as Nosepass, Koffing, and Lileep can stifle the presence of faster physical attackers such as Pidgeotto and Aipom. Mankey struggles against Dustox, so Pokemon that can remove it such as mixed Seaking and Rhyhorn pair well with it. Elekid is one of Mankey's most common offensive checks, so Pokemon that can threaten it such as Castform, Delcatty, and Sunflora are all apreciated. Dustox is worth mentioning as it acts as a fantastic special wall capable of checking Elekid while also providing Toxic support.</p>"

Chinchou is a notable partner for its excellent type synergy with Growlithe, as it can easily KO the Rock- and Ground-types that Growlithe can struggle with, while Growlithe, in return, can eliminate the Grass-types that give Chinchou trouble. The aforementioned physical wallbreakers have the added benefit of breaking through special walls and tanks such as Castform and Delcatty, which also check Growlithe. Fast physical wallbreakers are themselves problematic to Growlithe before it has set up Agility, so Rock-types, Steel-types, and Shuppet support Growlithe by checking them.

Overheat is crucial, OHKOing common offensive leads such as Taillow and Delibird and having an 87.5% chance to OHKO Aipom. Flamethrower is a more spammable Fire-type STAB attack, though Fire Blast can be used instead for higher power at the cost of accuracy. Hidden Power Grass threatens Rhyhorn and also deals significant damage to Water-types such as Chinchou and Rock-types such as Nosepass. Toxic lets Growlithe cripple walls such as Lileep and non-Substitute Spoink. Crunch can be used instead to overwhelm Substitute variants of Spoink, which can otherwise use Growlithe as setup fodder.

Given that Growlithe can't reliably deny Snorunt at least one layer of Spikes, it is best used on a team that either doesn't mind Spikes or has a spinner in the back, like Staryu. Water-types such as Staryu and Chinchou can usually beat Growlithe one-on-one if they switch into its Fire-type attacks, so special sponges such as Castform and Dustox make great partners. Chinchou itself is a great partner, with it able to break through the Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types that annoy Growlithe and spread Thunder Wave to shore up Growlithe's average Speed; in return, Growlithe can break through Grass-types for it. Physical wallbreakers such as Aipom and Taillow also work well because of their ability to break through both Water-types and special walls that could overwise beat Growlithe. If a team doesn't have a Rock-type, a Steel-type, or Shuppet, such as on certain hyper offense teams, Growlithe can sometimes be used as a check to physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Aipom and Taillow, though it shouldn't be a team's sole check to them.</p>"

Earthquake ensures Onix is not completely reliant on Explosion to do damage, and while it's extremely weak, it does allow Onix to threaten some foes like Rhyhorn and Voltorb. Onix's Speed is maximized to let it outspeed other leads such as Snorunt and Spoink, while 200 HP EVs allow it to avoid getting 2HKOed by Choice Band Aipom's Brick Break; the remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to augment the power of Onix's Explosion and Earthquake as much as possible.</p> <p>Onix only fits on dedicated sun teams, typically as a lead.

Some leads such as Growlithe are slower than Onix but can OHKO it, preventing Onix from using Explosion but giving its teammate four turns of sun instead, which is generally a fine trade. Against leads that can outspeed and OHKO Onix, like Elekid and Staryu, Onix must play a dangerous guessing game due to Endure failing if used in successive turns, and thus sometimes it may be more optimal to switch out Onix and save it for later. Against Taunt leads like Aipom, Onix is best off switching out, as while many of these leads lack the means to KO Onix, they can switch into teammates that can while Onix is unable to use Sunny Day or Endure.

Thunder serves as Voltorb's primary STAB attack—with perfect accuracy in rain, it provides Voltorb the means to threaten foes without KOing itself, and it can OHKO some Pokemon like Taillow.

It also appreciates teammates such as Magnemite and Aron that can take on Poison-types like Grimer and Dustox. Aron also has the added benefit of handling the Choice Band users like Pigdeotto and Aipom that can 2HKO Exeggcute with their STAB attacks; however, Aron needs to be aware of their Fighting-type coverage. Although, Nosepass performs this job better, since it can wall those physical attackers and cripple them with Thunder Wave.</p>"

It also boasts decent coverage moves for Pokemon such as Koffing and Bayleef. Cubone is able to find opportunities to come in on passive Pokemon, like Delcatty and Dustox, and Choice-locked Pokemon like Nidorino and set up with Swords Dance. Earthquake is Cubone's STAB-boosted attack of choice, with it OHKOing Pokemon such as Rhyhorn at +0 and Lileep at +2. Bonemerang can be used instead to beat Substitute versus Pokemon like Rhyhorn, but it comes at the cost of less accuracy when compared to Earthquake. Double-Edge is Cubone's strongest option into Koffing, doing about half of its HP and almost being able to OHKO it at +2 while additonally hitting Grass-types such as Bayleef, which are Cubone's best defensive answers. It also threatens Flying-types such as Pidgeotto and Taillow that may want to pivot into Earthquake. An Adamant nature increases the odds of OHKOing Pidgeotto with Double-Edge, but it comes at the cost of losing Speed, meaning foes like Delcatty can outrun Cubone. Rock Head allows Cubone to avoid the recoil from Double-Edge that would put it in range of Choice Band Pidgeotto and Taillow. Substitute is used to avoid status from Koffing and to help Cubone deal with revenge killers like Seaking and Aipom.</p> <p>Cubone is mainly found on balance and some offense teams that prefer its power to the defensive utility that Ground-types like Rhyhorn may offer. Cubone also appreciates having defensive Pokemon to fall back on, as its defenses are rather poor, and its low Speed makes it liable to be revenge killed quite easily. Pokemon like Elekid and Mankey appreciate Cubone's ability to break through or trade with Pokemon like Dustox, Delcatty, and Koffing, which allows them to clean late-game. Cubone can struggle into strong special attackers such as Seaking and Growlithe. To help alleviate this issue, specially defensive walls like Dustox and Delcatty can be good partners. Particularly strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Aipom can also threaten to OHKO Cubone after some chip, and Pokemon like Pidgeotto and Taillow can also threaten to KO it. Pairing Cubone with Rock-types like Rhyhorn and Lileep can help remedy this, while Shuppet can also be useful to pivot into these attackers. Grass-types such as Sunflora and Bayleef can also attempt to pivot in on Cubone's Ground moves and threaten back with their Grass moves. Cubone thus appreciates partners like Cyndaquil and Growlithe to threaten these answers.</p>"

Rhyhorn's high Attack allows its STAB Earthquake to threaten Pokemon that do not resist Ground or have huge physical bulk, which is complemented by its STAB Rock Slide targeting Bug- and Flying-types. Rhyhorn's coverage is further augmented by Megahorn, which threatens Grass-types, such as Lileep, Bayleef, and Exeggcute. Maximum Attack investment coupled with an Adamant nature maximizes Rhyhorn's offensive presence, crucially 2HKOing the otherwise unbreakable Lileep. Maximum Speed investment lets Rhyhorn outpace certain walls, such as Nosepass and Exeggcute, while also maximizing its odds to outspeed opposing Rhyhorn.</p> <p>Offensive Rhyhorn best fits on offensive and balance teams looking for both a wallbreaker and a check to certain physical wallbreakers, such as Aipom, Taillow, and Pidgeotto. Due to Rhyhorn's lack of reliable recovery and the risk of heavy damage from the coverage of the aforementioned wallbreakers, another Rock- or Steel-type, such as Nosepass or Magnemite, can pick up Rhyhorn's slack if it gets KOed prematurely. Given Rhyhorn's low Special Defense and weaknesses to Water, Grass, and Ice, special walls such as Dustox, Sunflora, Grimer, and Delcatty are essential. The latter also provides Heal Bell support in case Rhyhorn gets statused. Castform is another notable partner, as its high special bulk and strong offensive presence provides great synergy with Rhyhorn's own offensive presence and physical bulk. Paralysis support from Pokemon such as Butterfree and Chinchou greatly aids Rhyhorn by helping to mitigate its low speed as an issue. Finally, special wallbreakers such as Cyndaquil, Chinchou, and Growlithe appreciate Rhyhorn breaking through many of their switch-ins, such as Grimer, while in return they can break past its one true counter, Koffing.</p>"

Rock Slide allows Rhyhorn to threaten Flying-types, such as Pidgeotto, Taillow, Delibird, and Butterfree.

Protect allows Rhyhorn to net more recovery from Leftovers while also scouting against Choice Band users. Rhyhorn's bulk investment allows it to survive Elekid's Hidden Power Grass from full health while also avoiding the 2HKO by Fighting-type coverage from Pidgeotto, Taillow, and non-Choice Band Aipom. 124 Speed EVs allow Rhyhorn to outspeed Exeggcute with no speed investment.</p> <p>Rhyhorn finds the most success on offensive and balanced teams that require a secondary Elekid check or an offensive Flying-type check.

Delcatty is especially useful, as it can provide Rhyhorn with Wish and Heal Bell support to increase its longevity. Rhyhorn appreciates Rapid Spin support from Pineco and Staryu, or an anti-Spikes lead like Cyndaquil or Butterfree in order to maintain its HP for Elekid. If Rhyhorn is using Rock Slide, then special attackers, such as Chinchou, Elekid, and Growlithe can all threaten Koffing.

The boost from Mystic Water also increases damage ranges against foes like offensive Staryu, giving Horsea a higher change to break through them in fewer turns. Ice Beam targets Grass- and Dragon-types, 2HKOing foes like Exeggcute and Bayleef and OHKOing Bagon. It is also a perfectly accurate way to OHKO Flying-types such as Taillow and Pidgeotto. Hidden Power Grass targets Water-types; while it's slightly weaker than rain- and Mystic Water-boosted Hydro Pump, it is perfectly accurate and stronger outside of rain.</p> <p>Horsea should always be used alongside Seaking on dedicated rain teams.

Psychic is a solid STAB-type with few checks in the tier. Notably, a super effective hit on Poison-types like Dustox and Grimer narrows the pool of Pokemon that can check Natu. Thanks to Natu's solid base 70 Speed, it can use Substitute in front of Pokemon that could tank a Psychic such as Spoink and Chinchou, while at minimum Speed tying Castform, which regularly does not fully invest in Speed. Toxic racks up damage on the many special tank checks to Natu like Castform and Lileep, particularly synergizing with Substitute due to the free turns it provides. Protect primarily allows Natu to stall more turns while the opponent is badly poisoned, but the extra turns of recovery from Leftovers and scouting it provides are appreciated as well. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative that allows Natu to immediately KO even specially defensive variants of Rhyhorn and pressure defensive Staryu without expending Psychic PP, although it becomes easier to force Natu out when it can't Protect to force additional Toxic damage. Maximum Speed and a Timid nature are used so that Natu can confidently outspeed Pokemon like Seaking, Chinchou, and Cyndaquil. 12 EVs HP are used to maximize Leftovers recovery, while the rest are dedicated to Special Attack. Both of Natu's abilities can be useful; Early Bird allows Natu to switch directly into Butterfree's Sleep Powder and wake up relatively quickly, while Synchronize can punish the very common Thunder Wave, Will-O Wisp, and Toxic at the cost of crippling Natu.</p> <p>Natu should be used on balance and offense teams which can take advantage of the pressure it applies, and Pokemon that serve as reliable switch-ins to faster attackers that threaten to OHKO Natu are ideal teammates. Spikes have excellent synergy with Natu, as the damage dealt to foes switching in combined with Toxic's increasing damage makes it very difficult to answer. Snorunt stands out as a Spiker with a strong offensive profile, although Pineco's Explosion can also get the ball rolling for Natu. Elekid sits in a nearly uncontested Speed tier, allowing it to clean up teams Natu has weakened and revenge kill targets like Pidgeotto and chipped Aipom. Swift Swim attackers like Horsea are similarly effective, running through teams once roadblocks like Chinchou and Bayleef have been put into KO range. Natu isn't powerful enough that it can threaten immediate KOs for offense teams, so other Pokemon that can such as Wailmer, Choice Band Aipom, and Seaking are great partners. Natu provides very little defensive utility, so it requires partners that can swap into attacks directed at it. Magnemite is a great partner, resisting many common Rock- and Normal-type attacks, keeping up offensive pressure, and even potentially trapping the other Steel-types that wall Natu. Koffing is another great pairing thanks to its mix of offense and defense. Its great physical bulk allows it to easily switch into unboosted physical attacks and threaten foes with Will-O-Wisp or its strong attacking movepool.</p>"

Protect provides Nosepass some extra longevity and to scout moves from Choice Band users like Aipom and Pidgeotto. Explosion is used to OHKO offensive switch-ins like Seaking and Staryu, which can open up opportunities for its teammates. Nosepass does great at supporting slower teammates by crippling checks like Lileep, Koffing, and Bayleef with Thunder Wave. It can also slow down offensive threats like Seaking and Delibird. 60 Attack EVs are to KO Magnemite after a Substitute with Earthquake and OHKO Seaking with Explosion, with the rest used to maximize bulk.</p> <p>Nosepass does great on balance teams looking for a catch-all wall for offensive threats like Growlithe, Elekid, and Castform. It can form a solid core with physical walls like Koffing and Bayleef since they can take on Rhyhorn and Cubone, respectively. Koffing is worth the extra mention, because it can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, which also helps put bulkier foes in range of Explosion. They also form a great Explosion core and generally cover each other's weaknesses well. Nosepass also does great at dealing with Choice Band users like Aipom and Pidgeotto because of its Rock typing, but it does have to be wary of their super effective coverage moves. These same Choice Band users make great partners because they can break through checks like Seaking and Chinchou. Aipom and Pidgeotto also appreciate Nosepass's ability to trap and remove Aron and Magnemite to open up the opposing team for them. Bulky support Pokemon like Dustox, Castform, and Delcatty also appreciate this removal as well. Nosepass appreciates being paired with these bulky supporters, since it cannot deal with Water-types like Seaking and Staryu. Nosepass desperately needs support against Flying-types like Pidgeotto and Tailow, since it cannot damage them barring Explosion, although they hate to stay in and take a Thunder Wave. Delibird is worth mentioning because it can safely use Subsitute in front of Nosepass, so Pokemon like Castform and Delcatty are great to help circumvent this issue. Slower setup sweepers and wallbreakers like Cubone, Nidorino, and Spoink appreciate Nosepass crippling faster Pokemon like Chinchou and Delibird with Thunder Wave. Nosepass prefers to be paired with a status absorber like Grimer or Delcatty, since burn cripples it entirely and poison wears it down quick with no reliable recovery.</p>"

Toxic can cripple some walls, notably Grass-types like Lileep and Bayleef. Body Slam is alternative over Double-Edge, trading power for a chance to paralyze foes. Choice Band is an option to let Aron act as a wallbreaker, notably allowing it to OHKO Staryu with Double-Edge, 2HKO Staryu and Seaking with Body Slam, and 2HKO Lileep with Hidden Power Steel. Unlike other Choice Band users like Aipom and Taillow, Aron's good defensive profile allows it to easily find entry points against common foes like the aforementioned Pokemon themselves as well as foes like Dustox.

Rock Slide primarily targets Flying-types like Pidgeotto and Taillow and Bug-types like Dustox and Butterfree. Earthquake mainly hits Rock-types like Rhyhorn and Nosepass, Electric-types like Elekid and Magnemite, and some Poison-types like Grimer. This EV spread maximizes Aron's Attack while giving it enough Speed investment to outspeed and revenge kill lure Rhyhorn, with the rest being dumped into HP. An EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Attack / 216 Spe can be used instead to outspeed all variants of Rhyhorn, though the loss in bulk is noticeable.</p> <p>Aron fits on balance teams that appreciate its unique defensive utility, taking advantage of other balance and some defensive teams. It stonewalls CurseTalk Grimer thanks to its immunity to Poison, making it a natural partner for teammates Grimer can otherwise take advantage of, like Delcatty and Elekid. Another notable Poison-type Aron does extremely well against is Dustox, making it pair nicely with special attackers that struggle against it like Elekid and Chinchou. It is also an excellent check to Choice Band Double-Edge users like Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Taillow, as it can switch into most of their attacks with ease, though it must be wary of their Fighting- and Ground-type coverage. Aron also must be wary of Ground-types such as Rhyhorn and Cubone, as well as Mankey, as they can easily OHKO it using their 4x super effective STAB attacks. Certain physical walls such as Bayleef and Koffing make good partners for their ability to switch into the Normal-types' coverage and check Ground- and Fighting-types. Most special attackers such as Chinchou and Growlithe have little trouble taking out Aron, so special walls and tanks like Delcatty and Castform are essential teammates. Aron struggles to break through Lileep and Koffing, so it appreciates wallbreakers like Substitute Delibird and mixed wallbreaker Seaking that work excellently in eliminating these foes. Chinchou deserves a special mention, as it can break through most physical walls, switch into and beat Water-types trying to eliminate Aron, and mitigate Aron's Speed issues using Thunder Wave.</p>"

When Wailmer is already damaged, Hydro Pump is used to threaten Pokemon that resist Self-Destruct such as Nosepass and Aron. Surf can also be used for its greater accuracy, though it also has lower power and cannot OHKO Nosepass. Roar is used exclusively for opposing Snorunt leads, as they most often use Endure to bait a damaging move to put them into range of their Salac Berry. Alternatively, Snorunt can choose to use Hidden Power Grass, which heavily damages, Wailmer, rendering Water Spout useless.

It is able to break through opposing leads like Butterfree, Growlithe, and Cyndaquil and common specially defensive Pokemon such as Dustox, Castform, and Delcatty. Other special attackers such as Elekid, Chinchou, and Growlithe greatly appreciate Wailmer softening up or taking down their hard checks and counters, which they normally cannot get through. Alternatively, physical wallbreakers such as Cubone, Aipom, and Pidgeotto can remove specially defensive Pokemon for Wailmer so that it doesn't have to use Self-Destruct to remove them itself. These same physical attackers appreciate the pressure Wailmer applies to Pokemon that resist Normal such as Nosepass, Magnemite, and Shuppet with Water Spout. Ironically, Wailmer pairs well with these Pokemon that resist Normal because Choice Band Aipom OHKOes it with Double Edge. Thunder Wave and Sleep Powder users such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Butterfree pair well with Wailmer, as they can cripple faster attackers to ensure its safety if it hasn't already used Self-Destruct. Butterfree in particular is worth mentioning, as it is a fantastic mid-game wallbreaker or late-game cleaner that appreciates how much Wailmer threatens Pokemon like Lileep and Dustox. Chinchou is also worth a mention because of its ability to wall other Chinchou and absorb Elekid's Thunderbolt. Bulky attackers such as Castform, Sunflora, and Grimer can threaten both Chinchou and Elekid, which otherwise prove to be major obstacles for Wailmer.

Flamethrower is an option with its better accuracy and greater PP since it still does well against the likes of Sunflora and Bayleef, but it fails to threaten Koffing and Dustox. RestTalk is the best recovery option to increase Numel's longevity. It's also worth mentioning that RestTalk gives Numel the ability to stall out Dustox in a 1v1 situation.

Hidden Power Water is an option to threaten Fire-types such as Cyndaquil and Growlithe, which otherwise use Snorunt as setup fodder, but it comes with the same flaws that Hidden Power Fire does.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Faster Taunt users such as Spoink and Aipom can completely deny Snorunt from Spikes on the field, and they can either use it as setup fodder or OHKO it outright.</p> <p><strong>Status Spreaders</strong>: Status spreaders such as Aipom, Magnemite, and Butterfree can cripple Snorunt with paralysis, making Salac Berry useless. Aipom can also cripple it with Toxic, rendering Endure useless. Butterfree is notable for sleeping Snorunt before it even has a chance to set up Spikes, incapacitating it for most the game.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong> Setup Sweepers such as Growlithe and Spoink do not fear any of Snorunt's moves and can use Snorunt as set up fodder. However, Growlithe cannot consistently stop Snorunt from setting up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong> Hazard Removal from Rapid Spinners such as Staryu can completely ruin Snorunt's effectiveness by removing Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves from Pokemon such as Pidgeotto, Elekid, and Cyndaquil can pick off Snorunt even when it has activated its Salac Berry. Cyndaquil is notable for being able to KO Snorunt before it can set up Spikes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Snorunt may look like a horrible Pokemon in ADV ZU at first glance due to its terrible stats and abysmal defensive utility, but Spikes grants its team a powerful form of support. Ice Beam is a great STAB option that also threatens common Pokemon such as Pidgeotto and Lileep. Hidden Power Grass allows Snorunt to threaten the most prominent spinner in the tier, Staryu, alongside other Water-types such as Chinchou and Seaking. Finally, Endure allows Snorunt to activate its Salac Berry and outspeed every unboosted Pokemon bar Voltorb, meaning it will always be able to get a layer of spikes versus Pokemon without priority or a status move.</p> <p>Snorunt fits best on offensive and balance teams that benefit from Spikes support. Due to Snorunt's prevalence as a lead, it often faces counter-leads that can shut down Spikes such Aipom, Butterfree, and Cyndaquil. Some partners that can deal with these threats are Elekid, Seaking, and Magnemite. These partners and other offensive threats enjoy Spikes chipping down Pokemon that are otherwise tough matchups for them, such as Delcatty, Lileep, and Dustox, allowing them to wallbreak much more easily. Snorunt also appreciates pivots such as Aipom, Delcatty, and Lileep to help it set up spikes later if it faces an unfavourable lead matchup. Additionally, the former two are great checks to Spoink, another tough lead matchup for Snorunt due to its fast Taunt. Lileep can also deal with common priority users such as Pidgeotto and Taillow, which completely shut down Snorunt with a Salac Berry boost, and it checks Fire-types such as Growlithe and Cyndaquil that threaten Snorunt. As teammates, priority users enjoy Spikes chipping down faster Pokemon such as Elekid into range of a KO. Even defensive pokemon enjoy Spikes which helps them threaten offensive Pokemon such as tank Castform. Shuppet uniquely denies Rapid Spin users such as Staryu, and it takes advantage of the Spikes on Delcatty and Pokemon locked into Normal- or Fighting type moves. Lastly, Magnemite walls Snorunt, so Nosepass can be used trap and remove it, while at the same time also handling priority move users and Fire-types like Lileep can. However, Nosepass does not have the longevity to do this repeatedly throughout a game.</p>"

    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Bagon has a few other options due to its move pool, but unfortunately, it can't make proper use of them because of its stats or ability. Using Dragon Claw may seem like a good option; however, with base 40 Special Attack, running a Dragon-type STAB move is pointless. Facade may also seem like a worthwhile option, but Bagon lacks Guts, so poison is the only acceptable status.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Koffing</strong>: Bagon is unable to 2HKO Koffing with Double-Edge at +1. This allows Koffing to reliably switch into Bagon and 2HKO in return with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Shuppet</strong>: Shuppet can easily withstand a Hydro Pump and cripple Bagon with its status options or 2HKO with Shadow Ball. Shuppet must be wary of Hidden Power Ghost, as it OHKOes even without an Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>Dustox</strong>: Dustox can withstand one Double-Edge at +1 from Bagon and can use Whirlwind to phase it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Bagon is quite frail and is easily threatened by faster attackers that have moves it doesn't resist such as Aipom, Chinchou, and Delibird. These Pokemon make setup opportunities hard to find.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After just one Dragon Dance, Bagon outspeeds the entirety of the unboosted metagame bar Voltorb. This, coupled with its already respectable base Attack and its rare typing, cements Bagon as an extremely effective mid-game wallbreaker and sweeper. Double-Edge is Bagon's strongest physical option, allowing it to threaten common special attackers like Elekid, Staryu, and Chinchou after a Dragon Dance. Additionally, Double-Edge hits a majority of the metagame for neutral damage. Bagon is also able to negate the recoil damage from Double-Edge thanks to Rock Head. Brick Break primarily targets Normal- and Steel-types like Aipom, Delcatty, and Magnemite, but it also 2HKOes physically defensive Lileep at +2. Hydro Pump threatens Rock- and Ground-types like Rhyhorn and Cubone. Alternatively, Bagon can use Hidden Power Ghost to avoid being walled by the tier's only Ghost-type, Shuppet. A Lum Berry provides Bagon with a free setup opportunity against status users. The most notable instance of this is against Elekid that may try to use Toxic or Thunder Wave to reduce Bagon's chances of sweeping.</p> <p>Bagon excels on offense and balance teams that aim to take advantage of Elekid that lack Ice Punch. It can withstand one Thunderbolt when healthy and can outspeed and OHKO it after one Dragon Dance boost. Wallbreakers like Pidgeotto and Aipom appreciate this immensely, as Elekid outspeeds them and threatens them with Thunderbolt. Secondary sweepers such as Masquerain, Croconaw, Growlithe, and Butterfree all benefit from Elekid's removal as well. These sweepers can also act as mid-game breakers if Bagon is more poised for a successful late-game. Butterfree is worth mentioning, as its access to Sleep Powder creates more opportunities for Bagon to set up. Bagon can be completely walled by Koffing, so special attackers that threaten it such as Chinchou, Croconaw, and Elekid pair well with Bagon. Elekid is worth mentioning, as it can offensively check Aipom so Bagon doesn't need to rely on a Speed boost from Dragon Dance.</p>"
