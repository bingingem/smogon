Paired with its above-average Speed tier, it is a frightening lead, particularly versus slower leads like Snorunt, Cyndaquil, and Spoink. Sleep Powder's nigh-perfect accuracy allows Butterfree to put switch-ins or opposing leads to sleep, which makes them deadweight for most of the game. Psychic is Butterfree's strongest move, and thanks to the rarity of viable Dark- and Steel-types, it is almost drawback-free. Hidden Power Grass allows Butterfree to OHKO offensive Rhyhorn while also threatening Ground-types such as Cubone and Water-types like Seaking and Staryu. Giga Drain is an option to provide Butterfree a form of recovery that helps complement Morning Sun's low PP, though it also has low PP and is weaker. Morning Sun provides Butterfree with reliable recovery and allows it to keep itself healthy throughout the match. Butterfree can opt to use Stun Spore alongside Sleep Powder in order to neuter faster threats such as Aipom, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Elekid. If Stun Spore is used over Morning Sun, Butterfree appreciates the limited recovery that Leftovers and Giga Drain provide.</p> <p>Butterfree fits best on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate the free turns that Sleep Powder provides. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves, such as Spoink, Seaking, and Chinchou, pair up nicely with Butterfree. Chinchou is worth noting due to its additional resistances to Ice and Electric. Its access to Thunder Wave means Butterfree's team can also spread status more easily. Wallbreakers such as Aipom, Castform, and Elekid all appreciate the opportunity to switch in on sleeping Pokemon. Aipom can act as an offensive pivot for Butterfree, as it threatens Butterfree's checks with Double-Edge and Brick Break. Likewise, Castform is worth mentioning, as it can tank special moves from Butterfree's checks and deal heavy damage in return. Setup sweepers such as Croconaw, Growlithe, Cubone, and Spoink appreciate the setup opportunity that Sleep Powder and Stun Spore provides them. Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyhorn, Aron, Magnemite, and Nosepass can switch into the STAB moves of faster physical attackers that threaten Butterfree such as Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Aipom.</p>"

Nosepass can also trap and remove opposing Magnemite, another prominent Butterfree check. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves such as Growlithe, Seaking, and Spoink all make good partners. Growlithe is able to act as a wallbreaker with Overheat making it a great partner.

This allows Cyndaquil to beat leads that would otherwise outspeed and OHKO it, such as Aipom, although it must be careful of paralysis. Fire Blast threatens leads such as Snorunt with an OHKO and packs a huge punch with Blaze active, 2HKOing specially bulky Pokemon such as Delcatty and Grimer. It can even 2HKO some Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Staryu and Chinchou. Hidden Power Grass hits Water- and Rock-types that resist Fire Blast such as Seaking and Rhyhorn.

Finally, Normal-resistant Pokemon like Corsola, Anorith, and Rhyhorn can set up on Noctowl if it is lacking Hidden Power Grass, so Pokemon like Clamperl, Wartortle, and Koffing, respectively, can be great to help counter these Pokemon.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Noctowl is able to be a decent offensive threat despite low attacking stats due to its excellent offensive typing and coverage while leveraging its superb bulk to check Pokemon like Quilava and Sunflora. Castform is notable competition for Noctowl, but Noctowl has much better bulk and has access to moves like Psychic, allowing Noctowl hit physical walls such as Koffing and Ariados much more effectively. Double-Edge is Noctowl's main attacking move, dealing decent damage into a majority of the tier. Alternatively, Return can be used if you wish to preserve Noctowl's bulk, though this comes at a cost in power, as Noctowl cannot 2HKO Pokemon like Seaking. Hidden Power Grass threatens Normal-resistant Pokemon in Corsola and Rhyhorn with a 2HKO and an OHKO, respectively. Psychic threatens the physically bulky Koffing. Reflect can be used to support Noctowl's teammates, such as Beedrill, into Pokemon such as Aipom. Toxic allows Noctowl to threaten physical walls it cannot hit with its coverage such as Lileep. Protect allows Noctowl to gain extra passive recovery from Leftovers, scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Doduo, and stall out rain or sun turns when facing Pokemon such as Seaking and Ponyta. 128 Defense EVs allow Noctowl to live a variety of physical hits from Pokemon such as Choice Band Aipom, while 128 Speed EVs allow Noctowl to outspeed Pokemon such as Flaaffy and Magnemite.</p> <p>Noctowl fits best on balance and hyper offense teams that appreciate Noctowl's great matchup into other hyper offense teams thanks to its ability to handle Pokemon such as Abra and Quilava while exerting a decent offensive presence. Some partners that appreciate Noctowl's presence include Corsola and Flaaffy, as Noctowl can handle Grass- and Water-types such as Sunny Day Gloom, Rain Dance Seaking, and Lombre. Beedrill and Anorith additionally appreciate Noctowl's ability to break their checks in Corsola and Koffing while also appreciating Noctowl setting up Reflect, which gives them more opportunities to set up. Reflect additionally helps Calm Mind Drowzee set up, especially versus Pokemon such as Choice Band Doduo. Ponyta also likes Noctowl's favorable matchups into Corsola and Seaking, which sets up rain on Ponyta. Noctowl appreciates Pokemon such as Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Sunflora that cover its weakness into Electric-types. Chinchou and Flaaffy are especially notable because the former resists Ice-type moves, which Noctowl is threatened by, and the latter can be a cleric. Other notable clerics include Delcatty and Mightyena, which help Noctowl's weakness to status and allow it to switch in on Pokemon like Koffing and Quilava more frequently. Sunflora also appreciates Noctowl checking Fire-types and can take advantage of Noctowl weakening the opposing team to clean. Wish users such as Drowzee and Delcatty are great partners for Noctowl, giving it more longevity throughout a game. Mightyena can be troublesome for Noctowl to deal with, so pairing Noctowl with Pokemon such as Ariados and Magnemite can be advantageous.</p>"

This, combined with its access to reliable recovery and Calm Mind, makes it one of the most potent setup sweepers. Calm Mind allows Corsola to comfortably set up against the variety of Pokemon that struggle to 2HKO it, such as Porygon, Mightyena, and Choice-locked Normal-types like Doduo and Aipom. With two Calm Mind boosts, Corsola can reliably avoid being 2HKOed by its most common offensive checks, Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Quilava, notably also surviving super effective hits like Hidden Power Grass. Recover provides Corsola with a reliable form of recovery, which helps increase the number of setup opportunities available. Refresh prevents it from being forced out by status users such as Porygon, Koffing, and Castform, drastically increasing its setup opportunities and allowing for almost riskless Calm Mind uses. Alternatively, Ice Beam is an option to threaten Tropius and specially defensive Gloom, two of Corsola's biggest defensive answers. Natural Cure lets Corsola heal off status conditions; while somewhat redundant alongside Refresh, it is still Corsola's most useful ability on this set.</p> <p>Corsola excels on balance and bulkier teams that appreciate its defensive typing and setup capabilities. Its premier partner Gloom excels on these kinds of teams. These two make for perfect partners, as Gloom can check Flaaffy, Chinchou, and opposing Corsola and helps with Corsola's susceptibility to being taken advantage of by weather users like opposing Gloom and Seaking. In return, Corsola can soak up physical attacks and threaten to set up on Pokemon that threaten Gloom such as Doduo and physical Seaking. Special walls like Porygon, Drowzee, and Delcatty pair well with Corsola, as they can wall Flaaffy and Quilava. Drowzee is worth mentioning because Corsola can absorb status for it, while Drowzee can pass a Wish to Corsola if it gets too weakened to use Recover. Corsola pairs well with physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Seaking, Volbeat, and Doduo, as they can remove Gloom and other specially defensive checks. Because Corsola can find multiple setup opportunities throughout a game, secondary sweepers and cleaners like Anorith and Beedrill make good teammates. Corsola can wall faster revenge killers such as Aipom, Doduo, and Volbeat or set up mid-game and remove potential checks to Beedrill and Anorith.</p>"

Even without the boost from its Petaya Berry, Masquerain can threaten many attackers and physical walls such as Rhyhorn, Castform, and Staryu. With Substitute, Masquerain can more reliably self-activate Petaya Berry. Hydro Pump is Masquerain's strongest move and has a chance to OHKO both Elekid and Aipom when at +1. Giga Drain provides Masquerain with a form of recovery while keeping it from relying on Hydro Pump's poor accuracy against Rock- and Ground-types such as Rhyhorn and Cubone. Agility allows Masquerain to outspeed and threaten faster attackers such as Aipom, Elekid, and Chinchou. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used to hit bulky Grass-types such as Sunflora, Bayleef, and Lileep which otherwise wall Masquerain. Ice Beam also allows Masquerain to focus its efforts on wallbreaking rather than relying on Agility to clean. Intimidate allows Masquerain to pivot in on weaker physical attackers, such as Koffing, or attackers that lack strong coverage, such as Shuppet. Masquerain's mediocre base Speed means it appreciates the boost that a Timid nature provides it. This allows it to Speed tie with other base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Wailmer and Growlithe. Modest can also be used but the only notable thing it can accomplish is securing a more favorable chance to OHKO Aipom, which requires the use of Agility.</p> <p>Masquerain thrives on bulky offense builds that appreciate special wallbreakers or late-game cleaners. Masquerain appreciates paralysis support from Pokemon such as Nosepass, Magnemite, and Chinchou. Chinchou deserves a special mention, as it's able to switch into Electric- and Ice-type moves for Masquerain and paralyze offensive threats that outspeed it, such as Elekid and opposing Chinchou. Other sweepers like Bagon, Mankey, and Croconaw appreciate Masquerain's role compression, which allows it to act as a sweeper or wallbreaker. Physical attackers such as Pidgeotto, Aipom, and Cubone can threaten special walls such as Delcatty and Dustox for Masquerain. These physical attackers also threaten Substitute + Calm Mind Spoink, which otherwise turns Masquerain into setup fodder. Dustox makes for a fantastic partner; it can phaze out Spoink with Whirlwind while walling special attackers that threaten Masquerain, such as Elekid and Chinchou. It's also a more reliable check to Koffing, which helps prevent Masquerain from being statused. If Masquerain lacks Ice Beam, Pokemon that can threaten Grass-types such as Growlithe, Pidgeotto, and Seaking are appreciated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to great mixed bulk, an acceptable defensive typing, and an incredible suite of utility moves, Delcatty is a staple cleric of the tier and excellent choice for any team needing a solid backbone and support Pokemon. Wish differentiates Delcatty from other walls and other bulky Normal-types like Castform thanks to the amount of support it provides. Protect allows Delcatty to safely receive its own Wish, as well as accrue additional Leftovers recovery and scout the intentions of Choice Band users such as Aipom. Body Slam is a solid damaging move when bolstered by STAB and a 30% paralysis rate, which ensures that Delcatty isn't too passive when checking threats. Heal Bell allows Delcatty to remove status from itself and its teammates. This is particularly important if Delcatty is afflicted with Toxic, since it must spend 2 turns on the field to heal itself. Shadow Ball is an option to lure Shuppet, which would otherwise take advantage of Delcatty's passiveness. Hidden Power Grass hits Rhyhorn, which easily switches into Delcatty, but it can also hit the other Rock-types that don't mind Body Slam, such as Onix and Larvitar. However, Hidden Power Grass is easily ignored by Lileep, the most common Rock-type in the tier. Maximum HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature is used so Delcatty can reliably switch into special attackers, but a Sassy nature is preferred if Delcatty uses Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Delcatty is best used on defensive and balance teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check the many special attackers in the tier while also providing Wish and other utility. Lileep and Koffing are excellent physically defensive complements to Delcatty, checking many attackers that try to hit Delcatty on its frailer side, such as Aipom, Rhyhorn, and Pidgeotto. Lileep also particularly appreciates Heal Bell support, as Toxic is a very consistent way to break past Lileep and is splashed into the movesets of many Pokemon otherwise walled by Lileep. Wallbreakers are important on balance to help offset Delcatty's passivity. Rhyhorn is a more aggressive Normal-resistant Pokemon that becomes monstrously dangerous when supported by paralysis from Delcatty's Body Slam, and it can even come back for additional rounds of terror if restored by Wish and/or Heal Bell. Seaking and Castform are two great Pokemon that don't necessarily need support to wallbreak but appreciate Wish and cleric support for additional longevity. Other Pokemon with strong defensive qualities but no reliable recovery, such as Aron, Magnemite, and Chinchou, can stick around to fulfill their functions for much longer when they are kept alive by Wish. While the support Delcatty brings is unparalleled in the tier, it can be quite passive in the face of setup threats unafraid of Body Slam, such as Lum Berry users and Rock- and Steel-types using Substitute like Magnemite. Partnering Delcatty with good answers to these tactics, such as Koffing and Bayleef respectively, will make Delcatty much more reliable. Koffing is a terrific counter to offensive Rhyhorn and can use Explosion to check setup sweepers that might try to use Delcatty as an opportunity to run away with the game, such as Lum Berry Bagon. Bayleef's good mixed bulk allows it to duel Rock-types, Shuppet, and Magnemite that try to use Substitute against Delcatty, and either spread Toxic or chip away with Leech Seed.</p>"

Rest allows Delcatty to set up with impunity against walls reliant on status, such as Lileep and Dustox, allowing Delcatty to checkmate more passive teams if their phazer is KOed or Delcatty is the last Pokemon remaining.</p> <p>Calm Mind Delcatty is best used as a cleaner on balance teams, leveraging its bulk to slowly push through a weakened team, but appreciating the defensive backbone a balance team provides. Lileep is a great partner, blanket checking a huge portion of the metagame and spreading Toxic to soften the opposition. Wallbreakers like Aipom, Castform, and Seaking do an excellent job of removing or heavily damaging Pokemon that carry tools that can disrupt Delcatty's sweep. For example, Aipom can force big damage on Koffing, which carries Explosion, while Seaking can lure Whirlwind Dustox and threaten it with Hidden Power Rock. In the case that Delcatty comes up short late-game, other cleaners like Elekid and Horsea do a great job at picking up the pieces for Delcatty. Delcatty struggles into physical wallbreakers such as Aipom or Cubone that threaten to 2HKO or 3HKO Delcatty on the turn it Rests, so physically resilient Pokemon like Koffing, Lileep, and Bayleef are solid defensive partners for Delcatty.</p>"

    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>A physical wallbreaker set utilizing Choice Band is an option, though this is largely outclassed by Choice Band Aipom. Toxic can be used to catch potential switch-ins off guard, such as Lileep; however, this means Castform has to forego Protect or one of its coverage options. Castform also has some set-specific options. Castform's Tank set may use Hidden Power Grass to OHKO Rhyhorn, but the coverage of Ice Beam is important to target Lileep. On Substitute mixed attacker Castform, Ice Beam can be used over Hidden Power Grass, as it still 2HKOes Rhyhorn while threatening Lileep with a 3HKO, though Hidden Power Grass OHKOing Rhyhorn is generally more useful.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Status Users</strong>: Pokemon that run status such as Butterfree, Lileep, and Koffing can all severely limit Castform's effectiveness. Toxic discourages Castform from using Double-Edge or Protect and greatly reduces its opportunities to switch in. Will-O-Wisp does the same while also halving Castform's Attack, effectively voiding its capabilities as a mixed wallbreaker since it can no longer threaten special walls.</p> <p><strong>Magnemite</strong>: If Castform lacks Fire-type coverage it cannot threaten Magnemite, which can cripple Castform with a status move or 3HKO it with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: If Castform lacks Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Grass, it has a harder time dealing with Water-types, such as Seaking, Horsea, and Staryu. Staryu deserves a special mention, as it can slowly wear down Castform through its own recoil, healing off Double-Edge damage with Recover. Additionally, the lack of super effective coverage means Horsea can usually withstand at least one attack from Castform at full HP, which lets it fire off Hydro Pump multiple times.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Aipom, Taillow, and Pidgeotto outpace Castform and 2HKO it with their STAB moves. If it lacks Ice Beam or Hidden Power Grass, Castform is unable to threaten Rhyhorn. Cubone can KO Castform after the slightest amount of chip, while Castform can only 2HKO with Ice Beam and Double-Edge if Cubone is healthy.</p>",

Protect allows Castform to scout would-be revenge killers that use Choice Band, such as Aipom and Pidgeotto, while also netting recovery from Leftovers. Castform's STAB Double-Edge removes Pokemon that resist its coverage, such as Chinchou and Elekid, while threatening special walls such as Dustox, Delcatty, and Sunflora. Thunderbolt allows Castform to nail Water- and Flying-types such as Horsea, Seaking, and Pidgeotto. Ice Beam enables Castform to threaten Ground- and Grass-types such as Rhyhorn and physically defensive Lileep. Flamethrower is an option to threaten Magnemite, but it requires Castform to forgo Thunderbolt, which limits its effectiveness against rain teams. Castform's EVs allow it to outpace maximum Speed Rhyhorn while still maintaining enough Attack to threaten special attackers such as Growlithe, Elekid, and Seaking. Castform's Special Defense investment allows it to avoid 2HKOs by Seaking, Horsea, and Cyndaquil, and possibly Growlithe with favorable Fire Blast damage.</p> <p>Castform excels on balance and offensive teams that appreciate an answer to weather or a special sponge.

Elekid pairs particularly well with Castform, as it is able to threaten physical wallbreakers such as Aipom and Pidgeotto. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Castform preforms best with secondary defensive support from Pokemon such as Dustox, Delcatty, and Sunflora. Delcatty provides Castform with recovery in Wish while also keeping it safe from status thanks to Heal Bell. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Lileep, Koffing, and Magnemite prevent Castform from being revenge killed by Aipom, Pidgeotto, or Taillow.

Under rain or sun its boosted STAB move 2HKOes nearly every viable special wall and OHKOes virtually every other neutral target. If it's using Rain Dance, Castform's only viable STAB move is Weather Ball, but if it's using Sunny Day, Castform may use Fire Blast instead, which is strong even outside of sun and still does more damage than Weather Ball in sun at the cost of imperfect accuracy. If it's using Rain Dance, Ice Beam is crucial for targeting Grass-types while also threatening Flying- and Ground-types outside of rain. When using Sunny Day, Solar Beam is used instead, as it OHKOes most Rock- and Water-types, which can usually tank a boosted Fire Blast and try to threaten Castform with their STAB moves and status. Castform's moveset is rounded off by Thunderbolt, which threatens opposing Water-types regardless of the weather and is Sunny Day Castform's strongest attack against Flash Fire Growlithe. Rain Dance has the option to instead use Thunder, which is even stronger at the cost of having shaky accuracy outside of rain, or Hidden Power Grass, which threatens Chinchou, a Pokemon that otherwise resists or is immune to all of Castform's attacks when used in rain. Mystic Water or Charcoal can be used to augment the power of Castform's STAB move, notably hitting special walls, such as Delcatty and Dustox, harder and 2HKOing the rare specially defensive Lileep. A Lum Berry can be used instead to prevent Castform from being crippled by status.</p> <p>Castform fits best on offensive teams looking for a powerful wallbreaker. Specifically, it is a fantastic option on dedicated weather teams, as it's among their best setters and one of their only answers to the other weather due to Forecast. On dedicated rain teams, Swift Swim users, such as Seaking and Horsea, and Rain setters, such as Voltorb, make great partners. On dedicated sun teams, Chlorophyll users, such as Exeggcute and Sunflora, and sun setters, such as Onix, are essential partners. On all types of offensive teams, fast physical threats such as Aipom and Taillow appreciate Castform's ability to break physical walls, while they in return can break through the remainder of the opposing team. Fast physical attackers are also Castform's biggest threat, as they can revenge kill it, so physical tanks and walls, such as Rhyhorn and Nosepass, also make great partners.</p>"

If it's running Fire Blast, Grass-types are important partners for their ability to break through Chinchou. Even if Castform is running Hidden Power Grass, it still appreciates their support. Psychic-types are notable partners for their ability to threaten specially defensive Poison-types like Dustox and Grimer, which Castform struggles to break through. Exeggcute is noteworthy for having both Grass- and Psychic-type STAB moves while also spreading sleep, which makes it easier for Castform to set up a Substitute. Fire-types like Cyndaquil and Growlithe pair well with Castform's coverage and break through Dustox and Magnemite for it, which is essential if it's running Hidden Power Grass. Physical walls and tanks, like Nosepass, Rhyhorn and Lileep, are also greatly appreciated, as faster physical wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Aipom, Pidgeotto, and Taillow, can easily revenge kill Castform, and the former can even survive all of Castform's attacks moves when at full HP.

Flamethrower threatens Magnemite, Aron, and physically bulky Grass-types, such as Exeggcute and Bayleef. Hidden Power Grass threatens Rock-types, notably annihilating the exceptionally dangerous Rhyhorn. A Naughty nature allows Castform to increase the power of its STAB moves without compromising its Special Attack or Speed but it worsens Castform's matchups against special attackers like Elekid and Staryu. A Lonely nature can be used to check those threats, preserving those matchups at the cost of worsening Castform's matchups against physical attackers like Aipom and Taillow.</p> <p>Castform best fits on offensive and balance teams that appreciate it checking a wide range of Pokemon.

Pain Split is Koffing's only recovery option besides Leftovers, but its low base HP means Pain Split gives it decent longevity and easily wears down healthy and high-HP foes like Noctowl, Tropius, and Rhyhorn. A Relaxed nature ensures Koffing's power isn't hindered while trading off Speed that is mostly useless given Koffing usually goes second against most foes, and outspeeding Corsola is less important than losing out on extra power on Hidden Power Grass.</p> <p>Koffing is a good fit for balance and defensive teams thanks to it taking on prominent physical attackers like Aipom, Doduo, and Meditite. Pokemon that struggle against Gloom and Tropius such as Corsola, Wartortle, and Chinchou greatly appreciate Koffing. Delcatty is a standout partner, as it complements Koffing with its special bulk, can keep Koffing healthy with Wish, and appreciates Koffing neutralizing Pokemon like Gloom, Tropius, and Meditite that could overwhelm it. Koffing's vulnerability to special attackers like Abra, Ponyta, and Quilava makes special walls like Porygon, Drowzee, and Noctowl great options to form defensve cores with Koffing, as they appreciate it taking on physical attackers like Seaking and Anorith. Offensive teammates like Aipom, Ponyta, and Quilava love Koffing debilitating other offensive Pokemon so that they can more easily clean up weakened teams. Setup sweepers like Beedrill and Anorith are enabled by Koffing softening up teams for them, and they can take advantage of burned Pokemon for easier setup opportunities.</p>"

Hidden Power Grass is able to chunk threats like Rhyhorn, Corsola, and Seaking. Pain Split allows Koffing to stay healthy throughout the battle while potentially weakening other Pokemon.

Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava also appreciate Koffing's sun-setting capabilities, being able to hit even harder with Fire Blast. Castform also benefits from the sun, nuking opposing Pokemon with Weather Ball. On the flip side, powerful special attackers along the lines of Abra can easily OHKO Koffing on the switch or in a one-on-one scenario. Opposing Ponyta and Quilava are also scary for Koffing, taking advantage of the sun and Koffing's lower Special Defense. Against these Pokemon, bulky Pokemon like specially defensive Mightyena and Noctowl work nicely. +1 Corsola is also really hard for Koffing to break through and take attacks from, even with the sun up and Hidden Power Grass. Chlorophyll users like Tropius and Gloom can deal with Corsola thanks to Solar Beam, although they must be weary of Ice Beam.</p>"

Pidgeotto faces competition from another Normal / Flying type, Taillow, who has a better Speed and a useful ability in Guts. However, Pidgeotto has better attack and bulk.

Return can be used over Double-Edge to help Pidgeotto stay healthy, but it will be harder to get targets into KO range. STAB Quick Attack revenge kills faster Pokemon such as Aipom, Elekid, and Delibird. Hidden Power Fighting can threaten Pokemon that don't mind Pidgeotto's STAB combination such as Rhyhorn, Magnemite, and specially defensive Lileep.

Pidgeotto appreciates Spikes support from Snorunt and Pineco, which helps chip Pokemon like Elekid and Aipom into Quick Attack range over time. Spikes also allows Pidgeotto to 2HKO Pokemon it normally can't like bulky variants of Rhyhorn. Special walls such as Chinchou and Delcatty are excellent checks to faster special attackers such as Elekid and Staryu, with Delcatty also offering cleric support if Pidgeotto gets burned by Pokemon such as Koffing. Rock-types such as Rhyhorn and Nosepass can switch into Aipom and Taillow's STAB moves as they try to revenge kill Pidgeotto. Nosepass has the added benefit of trapping Magnemite, a common Pidgeotto check. Also, Pidgeotto's Grass resistance also helps Rock-types versus Pokemon such as Bayleef and Butterfree.

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Abra is a huge threat with its combination of Speed and Special Attack. It outspeeds and can revenge kill many weakened foes like Quilava, Aipom, Flaaffy, and Seaking. Calm Mind makes Abra an even stronger attacker and allows it to 2HKO even special walls like Porygon and Delcatty with Psychic after a single boost. Encore disrupts setup sweepers like Anorith and Beedrill as well as defensive threats like Wartortle and Delcatty by locking them into an unthreatening move. This offers Abra more setup opportunities and can make up for its poor defenses. Substitute pairs well with Petaya Berry to ensure it can be activated and is a safer way to boost Abra's offensive power without risking an OHKO. STAB Psychic threatens a 2HKO on many common foes such as Flaaffy and Seaking, making Abra very difficult to switch into and very powerful as a revenge attacker. Hidden Power Grass threatens mainly Corsola with the potential to OHKO it without a boost but can also serve to hit Water-types really hard and KO them with additional damage. Ice Punch threatens Tropius with 4x super effective damage and can also be an option over Hidden Power Grass to hit Mightyena and Lileep slightly harder. Petaya Berry coupled with Abra’s Special Attack allows it to swiftly clean up chipped teams, even 2HKOing special walls like Delcatty and Porygon with a +1 Psychic. Lum Berry is a great alternative to absorb and return status to preserve when Abra can be a threat without the additional power from Petaya. Lum Berry is ideal when running Encore + Calm Mind and no substitute. A Timid nature is recommended to outspeed the entirety of the tier outside of Voltorb and Elekid as well as Ponyta, which Abra Speed ties with.</p> <p>Abra fits both on offensive and defensive teams as a late-game sweeper and constant disruptor with the threat of Encore. Abra is at its strongest when it’s preserved to clean up late-game after its checks are dealt with or in a health range that allows Abra to KO them. This makes defensive pivots critical on any team with Abra to cover a number of common threats. Koffing can take on common physical attackers like Ponyta, Beedrill, Anorith and common Choice Band users like Meditite, Doduo, Seaking, and Aipom when they’re locked into a resisted move. Intimidate Mightyena and Normal-resistant Pokemon like Corsola, Rhyhorn, and Anorith can come in on Quick Attack users as well as opposing Abra and also do respectable damage to special walls that can get in Abra's way. Abra benefits greatly from a safe switch in due to its fragility, which makes strong Baton Pass users such as Ariados, Meditite, and Delcatty great pairings. Ariados can come in on Mightyena and threaten it out with a strong STAB Signal Beam while also taking on other threats with good coverage in Sludge Bomb and Psychic for Koffing and Beedrill. Abra’s extremely poor bulk makes it an easy target for priority users, notably Doduo, Ponyta, and Meditite. Specially defensive pivots are required alongside Abra to counteract opposing special walls that are not yet in range of a KO. Ariados can serve as a strong Mightyena switch-in and additionally functions as a slow pivot via Baton Pass. Delcatty can serve as a special wall and cleric support for Abra and other offensive threats on the team. Specially defensive Gloom and Noctowl can be great alternative options. Gloom can come in on many threats like Corsola and Mightyena and force progress with Stun Spore or Leech Seed. Noctowl can slowly wear down Pokemon that Abra doesn’t threaten like Mightyena or Drowzee. Abra enjoys being paired with additional sweepers that can enable its sweep. Options like Anorith can break through special walls like Noctowl, Delcatty and Porygon that can get in Abra's way. Weather sweepers like Seaking and Tropius can also open up Abra's offensive gameplan by putting opposing teams in KO range of its attacks. Choice Band wallbreakers like Ponyta and Mightyena can offer much of the same by damaging foes that tend to slow down Abra.</p>"

Besides supporting its teammates, Sunny Day allows Ponyta to weaken incoming Water-types that may attempt to check it, such as Corsola, Wartortle, and Seaking. Fire Blast, while threatening on its own, becomes incredibly hard to withstand while boosted by sun. Solar Beam allows Ponyta to threaten the previously mentioned Water-types and Rock-types. It's important to note that Ponyta has a chance to OHKO bulky Wartortle with Solar Beam if it first switches into a Fire Blast. Hidden Power Ground allows Ponyta to threaten Fire-types such as Quilava, Ponyta, and Magby. Quick Attack may also be used as a safety net against Salac Berry users. It is recommended to not run maximum Speed on Chlorophyll teammates. Toxic weakens potential switch-ins early in the game before using Sunny Day later. Lum Berry allows Ponyta to disregard status users such as Porygon, Magnemite, and Gloom, resulting in more opportunities to use Sunny Day. Charcoal increases the potency of Fire Blast, and it most notably decreases the chip damage needed to KO Gloom and Tropius with Fire Blast outside of sun. It also secures the Fire Blast 2HKO on Porygon while sun is active. Run Away is used instead of Flash Fire so that Ponyta can reliably damage Porygon if it attempts to switch in.</p> <p>Ponyta fits almost exclusively on teams that center around the usage of Sunny Day. Moreover, its viability as a Sunny Day user allows it to function on semi-sun teams as well. Chlorophyll users like Gloom, Tropius, Sunflora, and Nuzleaf all benefit from Ponyta as a Sunny Day user. These Chlorophyll users can set Sunny Day on their own as well, which prevents Ponyta from needing to come in multiple times to use it. Tropius is worth mentioning, as Ponyta can weaken or remove physical walls that may prevent Tropius from sweeping. Ponyta appreciates physical wallbreakers like Aipom, Seaking, Volbeat, and Doduo to weaken or remove special walls like Drowzee, Porygon, and Tentacool. On semi-sun teams, if Ponyta chooses to use Charcoal, then a Heal Bell user such as Flaaffy or Mightyena is beneficial. Flaaffy is worth noting, as it forms a potent special attacking core with Ponyta. Flaaffy also benefits from Sunny Day, as it can OHKO Volbeat and reliably 2HKO specially defensive Gloom with Fire Punch in sun.</p>"

Hidden Power Fighting covers Corsola, Mightyena, and Magnemite in one slot but makes Doduo's Speed IV a point lower, causing it to lose instead of speed Speed tie against opposing Doduo, Beedrill, and Anorith.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Corsola can switch into Doduo and can heal off any damage with Recover, while Doduo needs chip damage to 2HKO Corsola with Hidden Power Ground as it switches in. Tropius and Lileep can withstand attacks other than Drill Peck and force Doduo to wear itself down with Double-Edge recoil. Mightyena's Intimidate makes Doduo easier for it and its teammates to handle. Koffing and Wartortle can withstand a Double-Edge and potentially KO Doduo once it's chipped enough.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Aipom, Ponyta, and Quilava outspeed and easily OHKO Doduo or force it out due to its frailty. Abra OHKOes Doduo but must be wary of Quick Attack as do other weakened or frail faster attackers like Elekid, Staryu, and Voltorb. Ponyta and Quilava themselves can use Quick Attack to outprioritize Doduo.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Doduo's low HP stat and recoil from Double-Edge quickly wear it down and can potentially KO it. The turn-ending effect of Doduo KOing itself can be used to deny recovery to defensive Pokemon like Corsola, Gloom, and Lileep in order to set up a teammate to finish them off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Doduo is frail and easily worn down by the recoil from Double-Edge, so it does not want to risk even switching into Toxic from passive targets like Mightyena, Porygon, and Noctowl. A burn from Koffing's Will-O-Wisp will neutralize Doduo. Paralysis from Thunder Wave from Porygon and Castform as well as Flaaffy's Static is debilitating to Doduo given its frailty and reliance on its Speed to avoid being KOed itself.</p>",

Many Pokemon slower than Doduo like Seaking, Clamperl, and Meditite are OHKOed by Double-Edge. Certain physical walls like Koffing and Tropius cannot reliably switch into Doduo, while Mightyena and Wartortle are worn down switching into repeated attacks. Quick Attack compensates for Doduo's good but not amazing Speed and picks off weakened offensive Pokemon like Aipom, Ponyta, and Quilava, notably OHKOing Abra. Quick Attack is useful to finish off weakened Speed-boosting setup sweepers like Tropius, Gloom, Beedrill, and Ariados. Drill Peck deals over 80% damage to physically defensive Gloom, reliably 2HKOes physically defensive Tropius, and lacks the recoil damage of Double-Edge. Hidden Power Ground is Doduo's best coverage move for the few relevant physically bulky Pokemon that resist Normal in the tier, enabling it to 2HKO Corsola with some chip damage, OHKO Magnemite, and 2HKO Rhyhorn.</p> <p>Doduo is a good fit on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate both wallbreaking and revenge killing. Aipom is Doduo's most significant competition thanks to its greater bulk, Speed, and coverage, although Doduo's greater power and Quick Attack distinguish it from Aipom. Doduo threatening specially bulky Pokemon like Porygon, Noctowl, and Delcatty is appreciated by special attackers like Sunny Day Gloom, Abra, and Quilava, which return the favor to Doduo by beating physical walls like Corsola, Koffing, and Magnemite. Doduo's frailty leaves it unable to deal with Pokemon it invites in like Corsola, Mightyena, and Lileep, so it depends on defensive partners like Gloom, Corsola, and Koffing to compensate for its lacking defensive value. Doduo's frailty leaves it quickly worn down when using Double-Edge and rarely able to switch in for free, so partners using Baton Pass like Delcatty can bring Doduo in safely. Toxic users like Ponyta, Mightyena, and Porygon support Doduo by chipping down foes, wearing down Heal Bell Mightyena, and luring in Delcatty for Doduo to dispatch. Pokemon like Gloom, Koffing, and Corsola struggle against late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Abra, Ponyta, Quilava, and Sunny Day Gloom and Tropius, so Doduo's strong Quick Attack is much appreciated.</p>"

Maximum investment into Grimer's special bulk allows it to sponge special hits as effectively as possible, complimenting Curse's Defense boost.</p> <p>Grimer best fits on teams looking for a win con that can also function as a special wall against threats such as Elekid and Cyndaquil. Grimer traditionally sees itself used on balance and bulky offense teams, though Rain offense can also make use of its high special bulk and ability to pick off weakened foes. Grimer is incapable of making any meaningful progress against Magnemite, Rhyhorn, and Aron, and thus checks to them are essential for it to function. The former can be handled by special tanks and walls, such as Chinchou or bulky variants of Castform, who have the added benefit of acting as a substitute special wall if Grimer is forced out while asleep. Rhyhorn and Aron, on the other hand, can usually be checked by Water- and Grass-types such as Staryu and Bayleef. Koffing is another notable partner, as while it and Grimer share the same typing, Koffing completely walls Rhyhorn and Aron, neutering 2 of Grimer's worst matchups, while in return, Grimer handles special attackers that give Koffing trouble. Delcatty is another partner that deserves a special mention, as it can use Wish and Heal Bell to keep Grimer healthy, but its cleric sets also struggle to touch the same Pokemon Grimer struggles with. Finally, Rock- and Steel-types such as Lileep and Magnemite make good partners due to their ability to check powerful Normal-type attackers such as Aipom and Taillow, who can usually overwhelm Grimer before it can set up.</p>"

Endure in conjunction with Salac Berry allows Onix to tank a hit and subsequently outspeed foes that can otherwise outspeed and OHKO it, such as Elekid. Earthquake ensures Onix is not completely reliant on Explosion to do damage, and while it's extremely weak, it does allow Onix to threaten some foes like Rhyhorn and Voltorb. Onix's Speed is maximized to let it outspeed other leads such as Snorunt and Spoink, while 200 HP EVs allow it to avoid getting 2HKOed by Choice Band Aipom's Brick Break; the remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to augment the power of Onix's Explosion and Earthquake as much as possible.</p> <p>Onix only fits on dedicated sun teams, typically as a lead.

Some leads such as Growlithe are slower than Onix but can OHKO it, preventing Onix from using Explosion but giving its teammate four turns of sun instead, which is generally a fine trade. Against leads that can outspeed and OHKO Onix, like Elekid and Staryu, Onix must play a dangerous guessing game due to Endure failing if used in successive turns, and thus sometimes it may be more optimal to switch out Onix and save it for later. Against Taunt leads like Aipom, Onix is best off switching out, as while many of these leads lack the means to KO Onix, they can switch into teammates that can while Onix is unable to use Sunny Day or Endure. By setting up sun, Onix enables Chlorophyll sweepers such as Sunflora, Exeggcute, and Nuzleaf, as well as sun wallbreakers like Castform. Given the frailty of Chlorophyll sweepers, another Sunny Day setter alongside Onix and Castform, like Grimer, works well on these kinds of teams.

This utility is further augmented by access to Explosion, which lets Voltorb sacrifice itself to threaten its target with significant damage and safely bring in its offensive teammates. Explosion generally guarantees its teammates three turns of rain; some leads can OHKO Voltorb, though that gives its team four turns, which is often better due to the sheer power of rain sweepers like Seaking and Castform. Thunder serves as Voltorb's primary STAB attack—with perfect accuracy in rain, it provides Voltorb the means to threaten foes without KOing itself, and it can OHKO some Pokemon like Taillow. However, Voltorb generally prefers to use Explosion as quickly as possible in order to maximize the amount of rain turns given to its teammates. Taunt lets Voltorb deny utility from opposing leads, such as Snorunt's Spikes, Spoink's Substitute + Calm Mind, and Onix's Sunny Day. Bulky foes like Lileep can attempt to switch in and tank its Explosion, so Taunt can deny them the ability to use recovery moves against Voltorb's teammates.

The Attack investment and Silk Scarf maximize the power of Voltorb's Explosion, letting it OHKO most neutral targets and even deal significant damage to foes that resist Normal—for example, Magnemite and offensive Rhyhorn can find themselves taking over 50% from it.

Thunderbolt is Voltorb's STAB move of choice, threatening common Pokemon like Seaking, Butterfree, and Pidgeotto. Hidden Power Grass is used to threaten otherwise problematic Pokemon like Chinchou and Rhyhorn, but leaves it vulnerable to Lileep. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Grass to threaten Lileep for passable damage, 2HKOing it after a Petaya Berry boost, which can be especially important due to Lileep resisting Explosion. It is also able to threaten Sunflora, Bagon, and Bayleef. However, running Hidden Power Ice means Voltorb is completely walled by Chinchou and forces it to use Explosion. It also does notably less damage to Rhyhorn, failing to OHKO it before a Petaya Berry boost. Explosion threatens Pokemon that would otherwise wall Voltorb like Dustox and Delcatty, doing 66% minimum to both and creating offensive momentum for Voltorb's teammates. Petaya Berry gives Voltorb a much-needed power boost that allows it to OHKO Pokemon like Aipom and Koffing with Thunderbolt.

It can also immobilize special walls, allowing special attackers to have an easier time taking them down. Psychic is its strongest move that can chunk Poison-types that want to come in on Exeggcute like Koffing and Grimer. It also does great damage to offensive switch-ins like Elekid, Cyndaquil, and Delibird, which limits their opportunity to come in more than once on it. Giga Drain does well against the aforementioned offensive threats as well as offensive Water-types like Seaking or Staryu that want to come in and KO it. Synthesis is a reliable form of recovery to keep Exeggcute around to do its job for longer.</p> <p>Exeggcute is preferred on balance and offense teams who are looking for a physical wall that can open up opportunites for its teammates. Sleep Powder helps set-up sweepers like Growlithe, Cubone, and Larvitar come in and possibly get off a free boosting move or Substitute. Special walls such as Nosepass and Delcatty can work well alongside Exeggcute, since it can deal with physical attackers like Cubone and Aron for them. On the other hand, these special walls can help Exeggcute because they can deal with special attackers like Growlithe and Elekid that want to come in on Exeggcute, although they have to be mindful of coming into a STAB-boosted Psychic more than once. It also appreciates teammates such as Magnemite and Aron that can take on Poison-types like Grimer and Dustox. Aron also has the added benefit of handling the Choice Band users like Pigdeotto and Aipom that can 2HKO Exeggcute with their STAB attacks; however, Aron needs to be aware of their Fighting-type coverage. Although, Nosepass performs this job better, since it can wall those physical attackers and cripple them with Thunder Wave.</p>"

It also boasts decent coverage moves for Pokemon such as Koffing and Bayleef. Cubone is able to find opportunities to come in on passive Pokemon, like Delcatty and Dustox, and Choice-locked Pokemon like Nidorino and set up with Swords Dance. Earthquake is Cubone's STAB-boosted attack of choice, with it OHKOing Pokemon such as Rhyhorn at +0 and Lileep at +2. Bonemerang can be used instead to beat Substitute versus Pokemon like Rhyhorn, but it comes at the cost of less accuracy when compared to Earthquake. Double-Edge is Cubone's strongest option into Koffing, doing about half of its HP and almost being able to OHKO it at +2 while additonally hitting Grass-types such as Bayleef, which are Cubone's best defensive answers. It also threatens Flying-types such as Pidgeotto and Taillow that may want to pivot into Earthquake. An Adamant nature increases the odds of OHKOing Pidgeotto with Double-Edge, but it comes at the cost of losing Speed, meaning foes like Delcatty can outrun Cubone. Rock Head allows Cubone to avoid the recoil from Double-Edge that would put it in range of Choice Band Pidgeotto and Taillow. Substitute is used to avoid status from Koffing and to help Cubone deal with revenge killers like Seaking and Aipom.</p> <p>Cubone is mainly found on balance and some offense teams that prefer its power to the defensive utility that Ground-types like Rhyhorn may offer. Cubone also appreciates having defensive Pokemon to fall back on, as its defenses are rather poor, and its low Speed makes it liable to be revenge killed quite easily. Pokemon like Elekid and Mankey appreciate Cubone's ability to break through or trade with Pokemon like Dustox, Delcatty, and Koffing, which allows them to clean late-game. Cubone can struggle into strong special attackers such as Seaking and Growlithe. To help alleviate this issue, specially defensive walls like Dustox and Delcatty can be good partners. Particularly strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Aipom can also threaten to OHKO Cubone after some chip, and Pokemon like Pidgeotto and Taillow can also threaten to KO it. Pairing Cubone with Rock-types like Rhyhorn and Lileep can help remedy this, while Shuppet can also be useful to pivot into these attackers. Grass-types such as Sunflora and Bayleef can also attempt to pivot in on Cubone's Ground moves and threaten back with their Grass moves. Cubone thus appreciates partners like Cyndaquil and Growlithe to threaten these answers.</p>"

Rhyhorn's high Attack allows its STAB Earthquake to threaten Pokemon that do not resist Ground or have huge physical bulk, which is complemented by its STAB Rock Slide targeting Bug- and Flying-types. Rhyhorn's coverage is further augmented by Megahorn, which threatens Grass-types, such as Lileep, Bayleef, and Exeggcute. Maximum Attack investment coupled with an Adamant nature maximizes Rhyhorn's offensive presence, crucially 2HKOing the otherwise unbreakable Lileep. Maximum Speed investment lets Rhyhorn outpace certain walls, such as Nosepass and Exeggcute, while also maximizing its odds to outspeed opposing Rhyhorn.</p> <p>Offensive Rhyhorn best fits on offensive and balance teams looking for both a wallbreaker and a check to certain physical wallbreakers, such as Aipom, Taillow, and Pidgeotto. Due to Rhyhorn's lack of reliable recovery and the risk of heavy damage from the coverage of the aforementioned wallbreakers, another Rock- or Steel-type, such as Nosepass or Magnemite, can pick up Rhyhorn's slack if it gets KOed prematurely. Given Rhyhorn's low Special Defense and weaknesses to Water, Grass, and Ice, special walls such as Dustox, Sunflora, Grimer, and Delcatty are essential. The latter also provides Heal Bell support in case Rhyhorn gets statused. Castform is another notable partner, as its high special bulk and strong offensive presence provides great synergy with Rhyhorn's own offensive presence and physical bulk. Paralysis support from Pokemon such as Butterfree and Chinchou greatly aids Rhyhorn by helping to mitigate its low speed as an issue. Finally, special wallbreakers such as Cyndaquil, Chinchou, and Growlithe appreciate Rhyhorn breaking through many of their switch-ins, such as Grimer, while in return they can break past its one true counter, Koffing.</p>"

Rock Slide allows Rhyhorn to threaten Flying-types, such as Pidgeotto, Taillow, Delibird, and Butterfree.

Megahorn provides Rhyhorn with coverage against Grass-types, such as Bayleef, Lileep, and Exeggcute. Protect allows Rhyhorn to net more recovery from Leftovers while also scouting against Choice Band users. Rhyhorn's bulk investment allows it to survive Elekid's Hidden Power Grass from full health while also avoiding the 2HKO by Fighting-type coverage from Pidgeotto, Taillow, and non-Choice Band Aipom. 124 Speed EVs allow Rhyhorn to outspeed Exeggcute with no speed investment.</p> <p>Rhyhorn finds the most success on offensive and balanced teams that require a secondary Elekid check or an offensive Flying-type check.

Special walls like Dustox, Sunflora, and Delcatty can help check special attackers that threaten Rhyhorn, such as Staryu, Seaking, and Chinchou. Delcatty is especially useful, as it can provide Rhyhorn with Wish and Heal Bell support to increase its longevity. Rhyhorn appreciates Rapid Spin support from Pineco and Staryu, or an anti-Spikes lead like Cyndaquil or Butterfree in order to maintain its HP for Elekid. If Rhyhorn is using Rock Slide, then special attackers, such as Chinchou, Elekid, and Growlithe can all threaten Koffing.

Thunderbolt deals significant damage to Corsola and Clamperl, which otherwise switch in on Return and threaten to respectively wall and break through Porygon, and it's stronger against other Water-types like Wartortle, Horsea, and Staryu. Return is a stronger alternative to 2HKO Ponyta and Quilava, notably OHKOing Abra, and it doesn't leave Porygon reliant on Toxic to beat Chinchou. Ice Beam is strong against Gloom and Tropius and keeps Porygon threatening against physical attackers like Cubone and Rhyhorn. Toxic wears down offensive foes like Seaking, Ponyta, and Quilava while Porygon recovers, puts walls like opposing Porygon and Lileep on a timer, and forces Pokemon with ways to mitigate status like Corsola and Noctowl to switch out in Corsola's case or use Refresh and Rest respectively. Thunder Wave is an alternative to Toxic to neutralize fast attackers like Ponyta and Quilava, but it leaves Porygon more passive and unable to wear down opposing walls and Chinchou. Trace has interesting utility perks for Porygon, potentially allowing it to use Corsola's and Staryu's Natural Cure to heal off status and become immune to Flash Fire Ponyta's STAB moves.</p> <p>Porygon's sole Fighting weakness means special attackers like Ponyta, Quilava, and Abra struggle to break through it without support, so it's a great fit for bulky offense and balance teams. Physically defensive Pokemon like Corsola, Gloom, and Koffing are great partners for Porygon given their complementary bulk, making defensive cores that are tough to break, and all of them can absorb Toxic for Porygon and handle offensive Poison-types like Beedrill and Ariados. Tropius is another physically defensive Pokemon that particularly appreciates Porygon handling Ponyta and Quilava, and in return, it can handle Aipom and Meditite for Porygon. Mightyena helps neutralize physical attackers for Porygon with Intimidate and provides cleric support in case Porygon is afflicted by status. Setup sweepers like Beedrill, Anorith, and Abra benefit from Porygon wearing down foes with Toxic so that they can more comfortably sweep. Fast wallbreakers such as Aipom, Doduo, and Quilava benefit from Porygon handling faster special attackers like Abra, Ponyta, and Elekid for them. Porygon struggles to deal with Magnemite, so teammates like specially defensive Gloom, Ponyta, and Flaaffy should handle it for Porygon.</p>"

Alongside Early Bird, Reflect, and Rest, Natu is able to become a relatively bulky sweeper. However, this set takes many turns to become a threat and Natu is still susceptible to being overpowered even through Reflect and Calm Mind. Any other variant of Calm Mind is mostly outclassed by Spoink, which has much better defensive use and a wider movepool. Wish can be used as a foe is switching out to recover health on Natu or a teammate, but Natu's poor defenses make this a risky option to use. Night Shade can deal damage for very percentages of health in the very low HP stat metagame of ZU. But Natu's main STAB attack, Psychic, has good neutral coverage and power already and many of its checks don't even resist it, although Night Shade does hit Steel-types harder. Baton Pass could be used to generate momentum for powerful wallbreakers as foes switch out, but this would force it to drop Substitute.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types have the bulk and resistance to take Psychic while also being immune to Toxic. Magnemite and Aron can comfortably take any move Natu commonly uses and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Natu's Speed tier is quite good, but it's not elite. Faster offensive Pokemon like Pidgeotto, Elekid, and Delibird can outrun and threaten to OHKO Natu if it is not behind a Substitute. Aipom deserves special mention, as it has the natural bulk to comfortably take a Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If they manage to avoid a Toxic, specially bulky Pokemon like Chinchou and Lileep can switch into a Psychic and threaten Natu with their STAB attacks. However, they can be stalled out by Natu if they swap directly into a Toxic or Substitute. Delcatty is especially good in this role; it has the special bulk to tank Psychics, can 2HKO Natu with Body Slam, and can even remove status from itself and its teammates with Heal Bell.</p>",

      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>Despite seemingly being outclassed due to Spoink's superior base stats and defensive utility, Natu has some key traits that allow it to carve out a niche as a Substitute and Toxic user. Psychic is a solid STAB-type with few checks in the tier. Notably, a super effective hit on Poison-types like Dustox and Grimer narrows the pool of Pokemon that can check Natu. Thanks to Natu's solid base 70 Speed, it can use Substitute in front of Pokemon that could tank a Psychic such as Spoink and Chinchou, while at minimum Speed tying Castform, which regularly does not fully invest in Speed. Toxic racks up damage on the many special tank checks to Natu like Castform and Lileep, particularly synergizing with Substitute due to the free turns it provides. Protect primarily allows Natu to stall more turns while the opponent is badly poisoned, but the extra turns of recovery from Leftovers and scouting it provides are appreciated as well. Hidden Power Grass is an alternative that allows Natu to immediately KO even specially defensive variants of Rhyhorn and pressure defensive Staryu without expending Psychic PP, although it becomes easier to force Natu out when it can't Protect to force additional Toxic damage. Maximum Speed and a Timid nature are used so that Natu can confidently outspeed Pokemon like Seaking, Chinchou, and Cyndaquil. 12 EVs HP are used to maximize Leftovers recovery, while the rest are dedicated to Special Attack. Both of Natu's abilities can be useful; Early Bird allows Natu to switch directly into Butterfree's Sleep Powder and wake up relatively quickly, while Synchronize can punish the very common Thunder Wave, Will-O Wisp, and Toxic at the cost of crippling Natu.</p> <p>Natu should be used on balance and offense teams which can take advantage of the pressure it applies, and Pokemon that serve as reliable switch-ins to faster attackers that threaten to OHKO Natu are ideal teammates. Spikes have excellent synergy with Natu, as the damage dealt to foes switching in combined with Toxic's increasing damage makes it very difficult to answer. Snorunt stands out as a Spiker with a strong offensive profile, although Pineco's Explosion can also get the ball rolling for Natu. Elekid sits in a nearly uncontested Speed tier, allowing it to clean up teams Natu has weakened and revenge kill targets like Pidgeotto and chipped Aipom. Swift Swim attackers like Horsea are similarly effective, running through teams once roadblocks like Chinchou and Bayleef have been put into KO range. Natu isn't powerful enough that it can threaten immediate KOs for offense teams, so other Pokemon that can such as Wailmer, Choice Band Aipom, and Seaking are great partners. Natu provides very little defensive utility, so it requires partners that can swap into attacks directed at it. Magnemite is a great partner, resisting many common Rock- and Normal-type attacks, keeping up offensive pressure, and even potentially trapping the other Steel-types that wall Natu. Koffing is another great pairing thanks to its mix of offense and defense. Its great physical bulk allows it to easily switch into unboosted physical attacks and threaten foes with Will-O-Wisp or its strong attacking movepool.</p>"

Pokemon that can check or counter Koffing such as Tentacool, Drowzee, and Dustox are helpful teammates for Aipom due to it struggling to overcome Koffing on its own. Physically defensive Gloom and Tropius are a pain for Aipom to break without support, so it appreciates help from partners like Koffing and Fire-types like Ponyta and Quilava to neutralize them. Aipom appreciates bulkier partners that can check the few Pokemon faster than it; Castform and Wartortle can handle Ponyta, Mightyena and Porygon check Abra, and Chinchou and Delcatty answer Elekid. Aipom especially struggles to break Corsola, so it appreciates checks to it such as Flaaffy and Gloom.

This allows it to set up a Dragon Dance against Aipom that is locked into Double Edge or Delcatty, which can often only hope to paralyze Larvitar with Body Slam. After one Dragon Dance, Larvitar is able to outspeed and OHKO most base 85 Speed attackers with either of its STAB moves. Earthquake OHKOes faster attackers such as Staryu, Mankey, and Aipom if Larvitar is holding Soft Sand while threatening Rock- and Electric-types such as Rhyhorn, Chinchou, and Magnemite. Rock Slide provides Larvitar with an option against Flying-types such as Delibird, Pidgeotto, Taillow, and Butterfree while also threatening Dustox. Hidden Power Bug threatens bulky Grass-types such as Bayleef and Exeggcute, which otherwise OHKO Larvitar with their Grass-type STAB moves. Alternatively, Larvitar can use Facade to grant it a more powerful option when inflicted with status due to its ability Guts. Soft Sand notably allows Larvitar to always OHKO Aipom with Earthquake when at +1 instead of relying on a 93% chance to do so without it. Alternatively, Larvitar can hold a Lum Berry in order to prevent it from being paralyzed by Delcatty when it tries to set up, though this can be counterproductive if Larvitar is using Facade.</p> <p>Larvitar does its best work on offense teams that rely on special attackers. These teams appreciate Larvitar's usefulness in threatening common special walls like Dustox and Delcatty. Pokemon like Elekid, Chinchou, Staryu, and Croconaw all appreciate Larvitar for these reasons. These special attackers threaten Koffing, which otherwise walls Larvitar and has a chance to OHKO it with Hidden Power Grass. Chinchou is notable as a teammate, as its access to Thunder Wave can create more opportunities for Larvitar to set up or remove threats by remedying its poor Speed. Secondary sweepers that appreciate the removal of special walls and Aipom, such as Growlithe, Masquerain, and Butterfree, pair well with Larvitar. Butterfree's access to Sleep Powder makes it an incredible partner, as it provides Larvitar with more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance. Growlithe is worth noting, as it threatens Grass-types like Bayleef, which allows Larvitar to more safely use Facade over Hidden Power Bug. Larvitar fails to outspeed Elekid, Luvdisc, and Voltorb when at +1, so Pokemon that can check them, such as Castform and Dustox, are appreciated.</p>"

Nosepass desperately needs support against Flying-types like Pidgeotto and Tailow, since it cannot damage them barring Explosion, although they hate to stay in and take a Thunder Wave. Delibird is worth mentioning because it can safely use Subsitute in front of Nosepass, so Pokemon like Castform and Delcatty are great to help circumvent this issue.

A set with Substitute, Leftovers, and Focus Punch can take advantage of the switches Meditite forces, but the surprise factor goes away once the set is revealed, and Meditite is better at dealing immediate damage. A Salac Berry set with Substitute or Endure and Reversal can turn Meditite into a sweeper, but it struggles to set up safely and is vulnerable to being picked off by Quick Attack from offensive Pokemon like Doduo, Ponyta, and Quilava.

These same physical attackers appreciate the pressure Wailmer applies to Pokemon that resist Normal such as Nosepass, Magnemite, and Shuppet with Water Spout. Ironically, Wailmer pairs well with these Pokemon that resist Normal because Choice Band Aipom OHKOes it with Double Edge. Thunder Wave and Sleep Powder users such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Butterfree pair well with Wailmer, as they can cripple faster attackers to ensure its safety if it hasn't already used Self-Destruct. Butterfree in particular is worth mentioning, as it is a fantastic mid-game wallbreaker or late-game cleaner that appreciates how much Wailmer threatens Pokemon like Lileep and Dustox. Chinchou is also worth a mention because of its ability to wall other Chinchou and absorb Elekid's Thunderbolt. Bulky attackers such as Castform, Sunflora, and Grimer can threaten both Chinchou and Elekid, which otherwise prove to be major obstacles for Wailmer. Wailmer struggles against other Water-types like Seaking, Staryu, and Croconaw, so Pokemon that can threaten them like Elekid and Bayleef pair well with it.</p>"

Fire Blast is its preferred Fire-type STAB move since it allows Numel to 2HKO Koffing and 3HKO Dustox. Flamethrower is an option with its better accuracy and greater PP since it still does well against the likes of Sunflora and Bayleef, but it fails to threaten Koffing and Dustox. RestTalk is the best recovery option to increase Numel's longevity. It's also worth mentioning that RestTalk gives Numel the ability to stall out Dustox in a 1v1 situation. Leftovers is preferred to rack up recovery against more passive opponents, while Chesto Berry works to give Numel the ability to keep threatening its enemies since being asleep can make it much more passive.</p> <p>Numel performs best on balance teams looking for something to handle Electric- and Fire-types like Elekid and Growlithe. It pairs well with Snorunt since Numel can switch into the leads that can beat it like Cyndaquil, Elekid, and Spoink, while Spikes from Snorunt give it a greater chance to take down Dustox with a 2HKO. Special attackers benefit from Numel's ability to safely switch into Dustox and Grimer to wear them down. Fast attackers and setup sweepers like Croconaw and Aipom appreciate Numel's ability as a status absorber with its typing and RestTalk. With its horrible physical bulk, Numel needs support from Pokemon that resist Normal-types, like Rhyhorn, Nosepass, and Lileep, to take hits from Aipom and Pidgeotto. Koffing is a great partner because it can help with offensive foes like Rhyhorn and Cubone that can OHKO Numel with Earthquake. Water-types like Seaking and Staryu threaten Numel because they can stomach an Earthquake and OHKO back with their 4x effective Water moves, so support from special walls like Dustox and Castform are needed.

Pokemon that bait in Growlithe and Cyndaquil like Sunflora and Magnemite pair well with Spoink, since it can set up on them or force them out. Spoink can help take special hits for physical walls like Rhyhorn and Lileep in a pinch, but it really needs all the health it can get to start performing a sweep and thus should be preserved. Paralysis spreaders such as Chinchou and Nosepass are also appreciated to give Spoink an easier time setting up on different targets like Butterfree and opposing Chinchou.

Knock Off and Rapid Spin can be used on Choice Band sets in place of Rock Blast or Double-Edge, providing more options for utility.

Hidden Power Flying also punishes Poison-types weak to Flying such as Gloom, Beedrill, and Ariados trying to take advantage of Tropius. Earthquake provides excellent coverage, threatening Pokemon that resist Hidden Power Flying such as Flaaffy, Chinchou, and Magnemite. Earthquake mitigates Tropius's vulnerability to Ponyta and Quilava, and it can let Tropius beat them or significantly weaken them in a pinch if it isn't OHKOed by Quilava's Charcoal-boosted Overheat.

Koffing can also absorb Toxic and mitigate Tropius's vulnerabilities to Poison-types like Swords Dance Gloom and Tentacool. Pokemon that can absorb Toxic such as Corsola, Koffing, and Magnemite make great partners for Tropius.

However, without Hidden Power Grass, Snorunt cannot reliably threaten Water-types such as Staryu and Chinchou for any significant damage.

Aipom can also cripple it with Toxic, rendering Endure useless. Butterfree is notable for sleeping Snorunt before it even has a chance to set up Spikes, incapacitating it for most the game.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong> Setup Sweepers such as Growlithe and Spoink do not fear any of Snorunt's moves and can use Snorunt as set up fodder.

        "description": "<p>Snorunt may look like a horrible Pokemon in ADV ZU at first glance due to its terrible stats and abysmal defensive utility, but Spikes grants its team a powerful form of support. Ice Beam is a great STAB option that also threatens common Pokemon such as Pidgeotto and Lileep. Hidden Power Grass allows Snorunt to threaten the most prominent spinner in the tier, Staryu, alongside other Water-types such as Chinchou and Seaking. Finally, Endure allows Snorunt to activate its Salac Berry and outspeed every unboosted Pokemon bar Voltorb, meaning it will always be able to get a layer of spikes versus Pokemon without priority or a status move.</p> <p>Snorunt fits best on offensive and balance teams that benefit from Spikes support. Due to Snorunt's prevalence as a lead, it often faces counter-leads that can shut down Spikes such Aipom, Butterfree, and Cyndaquil. Some partners that can deal with these threats are Elekid, Seaking, and Magnemite. These partners and other offensive threats enjoy Spikes chipping down Pokemon that are otherwise tough matchups for them, such as Delcatty, Lileep, and Dustox, allowing them to wallbreak much more easily. Snorunt also appreciates pivots such as Aipom, Delcatty, and Lileep to help it set up spikes later if it faces an unfavourable lead matchup. Additionally, the former two are great checks to Spoink, another tough lead matchup for Snorunt due to its fast Taunt. Lileep can also deal with common priority users such as Pidgeotto and Taillow, which completely shut down Snorunt with a Salac Berry boost, and it checks Fire-types such as Growlithe and Cyndaquil that threaten Snorunt. As teammates, priority users enjoy Spikes chipping down faster Pokemon such as Elekid into range of a KO. Even defensive pokemon enjoy Spikes which helps them threaten offensive Pokemon such as tank Castform. Shuppet uniquely denies Rapid Spin users such as Staryu, and it takes advantage of the Spikes on Delcatty and Pokemon locked into Normal- or Fighting type moves. Lastly, Magnemite walls Snorunt, so Nosepass can be used trap and remove it, while at the same time also handling priority move users and Fire-types like Lileep can. However, Nosepass does not have the longevity to do this repeatedly throughout a game.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest can be used to try and keep Clamperl healthy to trade more, but it relies on team support through Heal Bell and thus can be inconsistent on a game-to-game basis. Deep Sea Scale gives Clamperl good special bulk, but it is outclassed by other Water-types such as Wartortle in a defensive role due to a low HP stat and no passive recovery through Leftovers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Chinchou, Flaaffy, and Elekid all outspeed Clamperl and threaten to OHKO it; though, all of these Pokemon are not able to switch into Clamperl safely.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While they must be wary of Ice Beam, Grass-types such as Gloom can take one hit from Clamperl and threaten an OHKO, but they are unreliable at switching into Clamperl.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong> Due to Clamperl's mediocre bulk, it is often OHKOed by many of the tier's special attackers such as Abra on sets without bulk, while Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Staryu and Quilava can threaten it out as well with chip damage beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong> Physical wallbreakers such as Doduo and Meditite all outspeed and threaten an OHKO on Clamperl.

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Clamperl is a huge threat for many slower teams with excellent offenses thanks to Deep Sea Tooth while being able to find common entry points on Pokemon such as Corsola. Surf OHKOes or 2HKOes the vast majority of the tier with the exception of Water-resistant Pokemon. Ice Beam threatens Grass-types with an OHKO in the case of physically defensive Gloom and Tropius while also OHKOing specially defensive Gloom after Surf. Hidden Power Grass threatens Water-types such as Seaking, Chinchou, and Corsola, OHKOing the latter after a Calm Mind boost. Substitute is a great option to punish switching around Clamperl, but Protect can also be used to scout Choice-locked revenge killers. The first EV spread is seen on offensively inclined teams to help Clamperl survive and trade with Pokemon such as Aipom with enough Speed investment to outspeed defensive Gloom. Modest is the preferred nature on this spread, as Timid does not reach any notable speed benchmarks. The alternate EV spread can be used more commonly on balance teams with a Timid nature to improve matchup against Pokemon such as Adamant Cubone and opposing Clamperl.</p> <p>Clamperl fits both on offensive and defensive teams as a wallbreaker. It is especially good at enabling Anorith and Beedrill, with its main targets of entry being Koffing and Corsola, which both teammates can struggle versus. Pokemon like Quilava and Ponyta also appreciate Clamperl trading with Water-types and checking Pokemon such as opposing Ponyta. Clamperl appreciates Pokemon that are able to pivot it in. Ariados and Aipom with Baton Pass can allow it to come in on Koffing or Corsola a lot easier to threaten the opposing team. Wailmer and Voltorb can be good partners, as they can use Explosion on Water- or Grass-types such as Seaking or Gloom while additionally giving Clamperl entry to continue wallbreaking. Notable defensive partners for Clamperl include Flaaffy, Gloom, and Sunflora, with all resisting Electric-type moves that threaten Clamperl while additionally providing offensive pressure against Water-type Pokemon.</p>"

    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Bagon has a few other options due to its move pool, but unfortunately, it can't make proper use of them because of its stats or ability. Using Dragon Claw may seem like a good option; however, with base 40 Special Attack, running a Dragon-type STAB move is pointless. Facade may also seem like a worthwhile option, but Bagon lacks Guts, so poison is the only acceptable status.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Koffing</strong>: Bagon is unable to 2HKO Koffing with Double-Edge at +1. This allows Koffing to reliably switch into Bagon and 2HKO in return with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Shuppet</strong>: Shuppet can easily withstand a Hydro Pump and cripple Bagon with its status options or 2HKO with Shadow Ball. Shuppet must be wary of Hidden Power Ghost, as it OHKOes even without an Attack boost.</p> <p><strong>Dustox</strong>: Dustox can withstand one Double-Edge at +1 from Bagon and can use Whirlwind to phase it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Bagon is quite frail and is easily threatened by faster attackers that have moves it doesn't resist such as Aipom, Chinchou, and Delibird. These Pokemon make setup opportunities hard to find.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>After just one Dragon Dance, Bagon outspeeds the entirety of the unboosted metagame bar Voltorb. This, coupled with its already respectable base Attack and its rare typing, cements Bagon as an extremely effective mid-game wallbreaker and sweeper. Double-Edge is Bagon's strongest physical option, allowing it to threaten common special attackers like Elekid, Staryu, and Chinchou after a Dragon Dance. Additionally, Double-Edge hits a majority of the metagame for neutral damage. Bagon is also able to negate the recoil damage from Double-Edge thanks to Rock Head. Brick Break primarily targets Normal- and Steel-types like Aipom, Delcatty, and Magnemite, but it also 2HKOes physically defensive Lileep at +2. Hydro Pump threatens Rock- and Ground-types like Rhyhorn and Cubone. Alternatively, Bagon can use Hidden Power Ghost to avoid being walled by the tier's only Ghost-type, Shuppet. A Lum Berry provides Bagon with a free setup opportunity against status users. The most notable instance of this is against Elekid that may try to use Toxic or Thunder Wave to reduce Bagon's chances of sweeping.</p> <p>Bagon excels on offense and balance teams that aim to take advantage of Elekid that lack Ice Punch. It can withstand one Thunderbolt when healthy and can outspeed and OHKO it after one Dragon Dance boost. Wallbreakers like Pidgeotto and Aipom appreciate this immensely, as Elekid outspeeds them and threatens them with Thunderbolt. Secondary sweepers such as Masquerain, Croconaw, Growlithe, and Butterfree all benefit from Elekid's removal as well. These sweepers can also act as mid-game breakers if Bagon is more poised for a successful late-game. Butterfree is worth mentioning, as its access to Sleep Powder creates more opportunities for Bagon to set up. Bagon can be completely walled by Koffing, so special attackers that threaten it such as Chinchou, Croconaw, and Elekid pair well with Bagon. Elekid is worth mentioning, as it can offensively check Aipom so Bagon doesn't need to rely on a Speed boost from Dragon Dance.</p>"
