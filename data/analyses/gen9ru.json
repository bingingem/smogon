        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Slowbro makes for one of the best physical walls and late-game cleaners in the metagame. It acts as an excellent check to a wide variety of Pokemon such as Terrakion, Barraskewda, and Jirachi. Calm Mind allows Slowbro to turn into a threatening late-game cleaner capable of ending games easily. Scald can punish switch-ins to special sponges like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra and Dark-type physical attackers like Bisharp and Crawdaunt. Psychic Noise is preferred over Psychic and Psyshock to stop setup Pokemon from recovering, making matchups against Fezandipiti and Suicune more favorable and cancelling Amoonguss's Giga Drain and Okidogi's Drain Punch completely. Slack Off and Regenerator give Slowbro incredible longevity and the ability to consistently set up with Calm Mind during the course of the game. Heavy-Duty Boots is an excellent item that allows Slowbro to make full use of its ability in Regenerator to stay healthy throughout the game. Rocky Helmet is also useful, as Slowbro switches into the many Close Combats, Iron Heads, Liquidations while also checking Maushold and dealing damage passively. Tera Poison makes Slowbro immune to Toxic from the likes of Okidogi, Fezandipiti, and Quagsire; keeps its invaluable Fighting resistance while granting it a Fairy resistance and removes its Dark- and Bug- type weaknesses to consistently check Okidogi, Mienshao, and others. Tera Fairy rids Slowbro of its Ghost-, Bug-, and Dark-type weaknesses</p> <p>Calm Mind Slowbro fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, as they enjoy its ability to check the many physical attackers running around the tier. Cyclizar makes for a great partner because it resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks and is immune to Ghost-type attacks, while Slowbro resists Fighting-type attacks and other strong physical attacks for Cylizar and its teammates. Cyclizar also acts as a sponge for the many special attacks aimed at Slowbro and as entry hazard control. Amoonguss pairs well with Slowbro because it forms a Regenerator core alongside Slowbro while preventing it by getting poisoned from the likes of Fezandipiti and Okidogi. Amoonguss also eases the pressure off of Slowbro by helping in answering the plentiful physical attackers in the tier. Hippowdon acts similarly in checking physical attackers while also aiding Slowbro against Electric-types like Rotom-Heat, whereas Slowbro switches into Water-type attacks for Hippowdon. Krookodile is a good partner for Slowbro, as it enjoys Slowbro's ability to check Fighting- and Water-types like Terrakion and Barraskewda, while Slowbro appreciates Krookodile's ability to set Stealth Rocks, remove items with Knock Off and take care of the Steel- and Ghost-types like Hisuian Goodra and Gengar that threaten Slowbro. Slither Wing is a great offensive partner for Slowbro because it invites Fezandipiti and Okidogi for Slowbro and resists Dark-type attacks for it. Calm Mind Fezandipiti and Slowbro work well together, as they both weaken Steel-types like Empoleon and Jirachi for each other while doubling as Fighting-type answers. Fezandipiti and Jirachi are excellent teammates because they form great synergy with Slowbro and are good Pokemon in general due to their ability to spread status and act as pivots while throttling setup attempts with Taunt and Encore, respectively.</p>"

      "Future Sight": {
        "description": "<p>Slowbro is among the best physically defensive walls in the tier with great bulk, multiple forms of recovery, and the ability to use Terastallization very efficiently against a good portion of the metagame. Scald allows Slowbro to punish switch-ins to Dark-types that come in to stop Future Sight, such as Bisharp and Overqwil while also threatening to burn specially defensive walls like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Empoleon. Future Sight has great damage output and enables Slowbro's teammates to force uncomfortable matchups during a game. Thunder Wave, similarly to Future Sight, can enable teammates to apply offensive pressure through forcing switches. Slack Off, combined with Regenerator, makes Slowbro very difficult to take down. A maximum HP and Defense Slowbro with Bold nature has seemingly unbreakable bulk on the physical side, comfortably switching into some of the premier physical threats like Barraskewda, Terrakion, and Galarian Zapdos. Tera Fairy is used to flip the weaknesses to Bug- and Dark-type, maintain the important Fighting-type resistance, and is generally a good Tera type defensively. Tera Poison keeps the Fighting-type resistance and can prevent Slowbro from becoming poisoned, usually the best means of taking it down, although it does make the matchup into Psychic-types like Reuniclus and opposing Slowbro more difficult.</p> <p>Future Sight Slowbro provides incredible offensive and defensive synergy within many team structures and is especially good on balance or bulky offense teams. Slowbro is often paired with other Regenerator users such as Amoonguss, Cyclizar, and Mienshao to form cores that are very difficult to break and can wear teams down offensively through hazard damage and gradual chip from U-turn and Future Sight. Slowbro can support teams through paralysis spam with other teammates like Bellibolt, Jirachi, and Thundurus, enabling offensive options like Basculegion-F and Gengar to take advantage of the boosted Hex damage or slow wallbreakers like Conkeldurr and Crawdaunt to outspeed most of the metagame. Slowbro generally likes to be paired with teammates that can absorb special attacks and are immune to Poison, such as Fezandipiti and Jirachi. To maximize the use of Future Sight, you often want to run physical attacking Fighting-types like Conkeldurr, Mienshao, and Terrakion, since Future Sight will lure in specially defensive walls such as Assault Vest Cyclizar and Empoleon as well as Dark-types like Bisharp and Alolan Muk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Jirachi is difficult to take down thanks to its typing and natural bulk, which let it stack Calm Mind boosts easily against a large portion of the tier. Psychic Noise prevents slower defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Reuniclus, and Fezandipiti from healing so Jirachi can eventually beat them. Grass Knot smacks many of the defensive Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that would normally handle other variants of Jirachi well, such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, Slowbro, and Gastrodon. Aura Sphere provides a coverage move that hits Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon like Bisharp, Hisuian Goodra, and Magnezone super effectively. Thunder nails Water-type Pokemon neutral to Grass Knot such as Gyarados, Volcanion, and Empoleon while boasting a nice chance to paralyze the foe and being a great option versus rain teams. Jirachi can usually afford missing a Thunder thanks to its bulk. Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types such as Armarouge, Reuniclus, and opposing Jirachi, which are otherwise safe from Jirachi's other options. Leftovers allows Jirachi to recover health throughout a game thanks to the many switch-in opportunities its bulk and typing offers it. Calm Mind Jirachi will often stay on the field for many turns as it sets up and chips at the opponent's team, so Leftovers recovery will easily pile up. Expert Belt can be used on more aggressive teams to offset the middling immediate power of this set, but be wary that Jirachi will be worn down more quickly. 224 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outspeed Mimikyu and Krookodile. Tera Water allows Jirachi to remove its Ground, Ghost, and Dark weaknesses, as well as letting it resist Armarouge's Armor Cannon and Volcanion's Flamethrower. Tera Fairy transforms Jirachi's Dark weakness into a resistance to handily tank the likes of Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Krookodile's Knock Off while being an overall fantastic defensive typing. Tera Fighting can be used in conjunction with Expert Belt and Aura Sphere to directly threaten high damage on Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon while being Jirachi's best Tera type against Bisharp.</p> <p>Offensive Calm Mind Jirachi works on a wide variety of teams, from offense to balance teams, looking for a bulky Pokemon that can weaken common balance cores while providing defensive value through its natural bulk coupled with resistances to Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks and an immunity to poison and Poison-type attacks. Levitate Galarian Weezing provides an immunity to Ground and a resistance to Dark coupled with decent physical bulk and spreads burn through Will-O-Wisp to help Jirachi withstand physical attacks much better. Other physical walls, like Hippowdon, Amoonguss, and Gligar, can likewise handle physical breakers such as Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile that Jirachi struggles taking hits from. Krookodile is a great partner, acting as a switch-in to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, fulfilling the entry hazard setter role, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from defensive Pokemon, and denying recovery attempts from foes with Taunt, which Jirachi can capitalize on. Other more sturdy switch-ins to Ghost-type Pokemon like Basculegion-F and Gengar include Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra and Assault Vest Cyclizar. Fighting-type breakers such as Galarian Zapdos, Slither Wing, and Mienshao pair well with Jirachi due to their ability to threaten Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that do well against Jirachi, especially if choosing not to run Aura Sphere, while Jirachi can switch into the Psychic- and Fairy-type attacks targeted at them in return. Because this set has difficulty pulling its weight against hyper offense teams, Pokemon strong against the archetype like Bisharp, Slither Wing, and Umbreon are recommended.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Jirachi provides speed control and offensive pivoting for many team structures. Defensively, Jirachi is a great team presence because of its great defensive typing and natural bulk, with 100 base stats across the board providing it with the longevity needed to switch into several attacks for its teammates. Iron Head is the most reliable STAB option for Jirachi to use since it has adequate base power, is neutral into a majority of the metagame, and boasts a high flinch rate. U-turn is a safe pivot move, allowing powerful partners to come in freely. Choice Scarf Jirachi uses Trick to hinder would-be checks like Amoonguss and Hippowdon, which can also greatly help teammates that struggle against these defensive walls like Revavroom and Terrakion. Healing Wish can give a second opportunity to a teammate that may otherwise not have enough health to get back into a game reliably. Using a Jolly nature with max Attack and Speed enables Jirachi to outspeed a majority of the tier, tying with other Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos or Dragon Dance Salamence after a Speed boost. Tera Steel is run to maximize its damage output with Iron Head, which can allow Jirachi to potentially flinch its way through the opponent's physical wall, along with hitting several notable benchmarks like OHKOing Terrakion and 2HKOing Noivern and Galarian Zapdos.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi is primarily seen in offense and balance structures, where it can pack speed control, support, disruption, and a solid defensive profile into one slot. Jirachi is one of the best switch-ins to Fairy- and Poison-types in the tier, as well as having key resistances to Dragon- and Psychic-type attacks, making it a reliable option to take a Gardevoir or Fezandipiti Moonblast or Salamence Outrage. Teammates weak to Fairy-type moves, such as strong Dragon- or Fighting-types like Salamence and Terrakion, are grateful for Jirachi's presence on the team to fall back on. Taking advantage of Choice Scarf Jirachi's ability to hinder and chip at physically defensive walls like Amoonguss, Hippowdon, and Palossand, teammates such as Revavroom, Mimikyu, and Okidogi can position themselves to set up reliably. Teammates that lack recovery such as Armarouge and Galarian Zapdos can function as both mid-game breakers and late-game cleaners when paired with Healing Wish support from Jirachi.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Offensive Empoleon is uniquely equipped to provide teams with a strong defensive and offensive presence given its natural bulk and exceptional coverage. Its Water / Steel typing and Special Defense is valuable in a metagame with strong Choice Scarf users such as Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar threatening to use their strong STAB attacks to clean games. Surf is a reliable STAB option for Empoleon, as it hits a lot of the metagame for neutral damage. Ice Beam gives Empoleon coverage to hit Dragon- and Grass-types such as Cyclizar, Noivern, Salamence, and Amoonguss. Grass Knot hits Water-types like Basculegion-F and Slowbro while also giving it a means to damage Volcanion. Roost assures Empoleon can reliably recover throughout a game. Leftovers gives Empoleon even more longevity and offsets most entry hazard damage. Competitive is useful for getting a boost from Defog attempts, Intimidate Attack drops, and notably from Moonblast Special Attack drops, as Empoleon often switches into Fezandipiti and Gardevoir. Modest is used given Empoleon has great natural bulk without much investment, giving it more wallbreaking power without offsetting the defensive utility it has. The EV spread provided covers a few relevant defensive and offensive benchmarks. The defensive investments allow Empoleon to survive Hippowdon's Earthquake after taking Stealth Rock damage, Conkeldurr's Mach Punch after taking one layer of Spikes damage, Salamence's Earthquake after taking one layer of Spikes damage, and two Dark Pulses from +2 Modest Blastoise. Offensively, Empoleon threatens to 2HKO Assault Vest Cyclizar with Ice Beam after it takes Stealth Rock damage, 2HKO Slowbro with Grass Knot, and has a favorable roll to OHKO both Hippowdon and Palossand with Surf after they take Stealth Rock damage. The Speed investment allows Empoleon to outspeed Adamant Conkeldurr. Tera Fairy flips its Fighting weakness into a resistance while also making Electric- and Ground-type attacks neutral, allowing Empoleon to stay in against Krookodile and Thundurus if needed.</p> <p>Offensive Empoleon fits on balance and bulky offense teams, as it pivots into many of the special attackers in the tier and provides an immediate offensive response. Strong Fighting- and Ground-types like Conkeldurr, Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mienshao appreciate Empoleon switching into Fairy- and Water-type attacks, namely from Basculegion-F and Gardevoir. Offensive Empoleon fits well on teams that can use alternative entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Jirachi so that it can maximize its offensive presence. Defensive teammates like Levitate Galarian Weezing and Noivern can switch into to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks while removing entry hazards and pivoting. Physical setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Mienshao, Okidogi, and Terrakion benefit from Empoleon being able to take on Slowbro and other bulky Water-types. Magnet Pull Magnezone can partner with Empoleon to trap and eliminate Steel-type Pokemon like opposing Empoleon and Jirachi, two of the better defensive checks to offensive Empoleon. Salamence is an excellent teammate for Empoleon, as it can threaten to hit most of the metagame with its excellent mixed offensive attacks and provide another bulky defensive presence with reliable recovery. Sticky Web setters like Araquanid and Galvantula can partner with and enable offensive Empoleon, as it outspeeds Adamant Overqwil, Adamant Okidogi, and Jolly Bisharp after they get slowed down.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Empoleon is among the best utility Pokemon in the metagame for its capacity to counter most special attackers, establish entry hazards, remove items, and phaze setup attempts. Roost allows Empoleon to remain healthy enough to switch in against the strong special attackers like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar multiple times throughout a game. Flip Turn can be used to gain switch momentum after switching into an attack, allowing teammates to position into whatever enters the field against Empoleon. Knock Off provides excellent utility in the form of item removal, namely Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing entry hazard damage to rack up as Empoleon forces multiple switches by absorbing attacks. Roar provides similar utility in accruing entry hazard damage while stopping setup attempts from the likes of Calm Mind Cresselia, Slowbro, and Reuniclus. Ice Beam gives Empoleon coverage to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types in the tier like Chesnaught, Cyclizar, Noivern, and Salamence. Leftovers ensures Empoleon can recover off damage taken from entry hazards and switching into special attackers. Competitive gives Empoleon a needed Special Attack boost when activated by Moonblast drops from Fezandipiti and Gardevoir, Intimidate from Krookodile and Salamence, and Defog from Galarian Weezing and Noivern, making even bulky utility sets capable of outputting good damage. Being a Defog deterrent gives Empoleon an advantage in maintaining hazards, as the notable Defog users often struggle to deal with its coverage, especially after a boost from Competitive. A Calm nature with full investment in HP and Special Defense makes Empoleon seemingly impervious to damage from special attacks. Tera Fairy flips the critical weakness to Fighting into a resistance, allowing it to not be as threatened by the likes of Chesnaught, Mienshao, Slither Wing, and Terrakion, while also flipping the Ground and Electric weaknesses into neutrality, making Krookodile and Thundurus much less imposing. Tera Ghost similarly helps with the litany of Fighting-types prevalent in the metagame and gives Empoleon a valuable immunity to Rapid Spin attempts from the primary form of removal in Cyclizar.</p> <p>Empoleon is a staple on balance and bulky offense teams needing to shore up their matchups into the strong special attackers in the tier, a stalwart Steel-type that can establish entry hazards, and another form of item removal or phazing. With access to Roost, Empoleon has instant and reliable recovery, unlike other Steel-types like Jirachi and Hisuian Goodra. Choice Scarf Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar pose many problems for Fighting-type breakers like Galarian Zapdos, Okidogi, and Mienshao, making Empoleon an excellent choice to support them through defensive switch-ins and subsequent pivots with Flip Turn. Physically defensive teammates that can absorb Fighting- and Ground-type attacks from Krookodile, Slither Wing, and Terrakion like Galarian Weezing, Amoonguss, and Chesnaught are excellent in creating cores that can cause issues for opposing teams, accumulating entry hazard damage and whittling teams down. Chesnaught benefits from Empoleon handling the main forms of removal in the metagame, such as Cyclizar with Ice Beam and Noivern and Galarian Weezing due to Competitive, forming a strong defensive pairing that can remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and rack up hazard chip. Slower teammates such as Conkeldurr and Crawdaunt that appreciate Empoleon's ability to sponge special attacks and safely pivot into them can assist in removing items and breaking teams through forcing multiple switches and hitting very hard into Empoleon checks like Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi. The combination of Water and Steel gives Empoleon favorable matchups into rain abusers like Basculegion-F and Kingdra, making physically defensive teammates like Amoonguss, Bellibolt, and Chesnaught, which also functions as a Knock Off absorber for Empoleon, valuable for their ability to switch into Barraskewda. Empoleon can gradually get worn down by hazard chip itself, making teammates that can pivot and maintain hazard control like Cyclizar and Noivern excellent partners.</p>"

Hippowdon has the best raw physical bulk compared to other physical walls such as Slowbro, Chesnaught, and Amoonguss. This bulk allows it to take neutral hits exceptionally well, making it a safe switch-in to unresisted moves like Terrakion’s Close Combat and Galarian Zapdos’s Brave Bird. As it is taking these hits, it is wearing foes  down through passive damage from the sand it summons. It also has many chances to switch in, giving it plenty of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Hippowdon is the anchor for most balance teams in the tier, putting in work and making progress in basically every game. However, Hippowdon can struggle with particularly strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Okidogi or Galarian Zapdos because does not resist their STAB attacks and struggles to take them effectively, and it is also vulnerable to passive damage such as entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<p>Other Options</p> <p>====</p> <p>Certain teams such as ones with Pokemon running Synthesis or that have teammates that dislike passive sandstorm chip such as Alolan Muk and Suicune would prefer Sand Force, effectively giving it no ability. Sand Force also makes it easier to Terastallize Hippowdon, since it doesn’t have to worry about its own sandstorm and has a better matchup into other Hippowdon due to its stronger Earthquake. Hippowdon can also run varying amounts of Special Defense in order to better match up against special attackers — for example, 140 Special Defense EVs to survive two Photon Geysers from Necrozma  — but Hippowdon often relies on maximum physical bulk to take neutral physical attacks.</p> <p>Checks and Counters</p> <p>====</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Mono-Earthquake Hippowdon is unable to hit Ground-immune foes at all, making Rotom-H, Thundurus, Salamence, and Noivern incredibly safe switch-ins to it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Hippowdon with Stone Edge can hit Ground-immune foes but can't do any real damage to Grass-types such as Chesnaught.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Hippowdon's low Special Defense and reliance on Defense investment means it is vulnerable to special attacks even from uninvested attackers. Pokemon like Gengar and Gardevoir are attackers that Hippowdon does not want to switch in on, and bulky Pokemon with decent special damage such as Slowbro and Reuniclus are able to take Hippowdon's Earthquakes and threaten it in return.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers with Entry Hazard Support</strong>: Pokemon like Choice Band Okidogi, Terrakion, and Mienshao can overcome Hippowdon's raw physical bulk with the help of chip damage such as hazard support.

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Set Details</p> <p>===</p> <p>The tier is full of threatening physical attackers, and Hippowdon handles most of them with ease, switching into attacks from Pokemon like Terrakion, Revavroom, Kleavor, Krookodile, Maushold, and Bisharp. Hippowdon's sand provides passive damage and helps disarm other weather teams by removing their weather. Stealth Rock is the most common option, as Hippowdon makes a good setter due to its many chances to switch in and good matchup against Cyclizar, the tier's best spinner. Whirlwind gives Hippowdon the option to force out setup sweepers or rack up chip damage against foes trying to switch into Earthquake. Whirlwind is preferred over Roar due to Throat Chop Bisharp blocking the latter move. Stone Edge is a coverage  option to hit Flying-types trying to switch into the normally passive Hippowdon, allowing it to turn the tables on matchups like Thundurus or Noivern. Stone Edge also helps to break Air Balloon on Pokemon such as Revavroom that try to turn Hippowdon into a setup opportunity. Rocky Helmet is the most common item due to its importance in dealing with Maushold, a Pokemon that can otherwise threaten to sweep teams on its own, while also providing chip damage against physical attackers. However, teams with other answers to Maushold or that don’t need the passive damage can instead run Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. Tera Ghost is an all-around strong defensive type that blocks Rapid Spin from Cyclizar, allows it to take on Terrakion even after a Swords Dance boost, and beats other Fighting types like Conkeldurr and Slither Wing. Tera Dragon removes Hippowdon's weaknesses to Grass and Water, being especially helpful against rain teams. Tera Poison gives Hippowdon a resistance to Grass, Fairy, and Fighting and makes Hippowdon immune to Toxic and able to absorb Toxic Spikes, being useful on teams that are otherwise weak to them.</p> <p>Hippowdon is common on bulky offense and balance teams. However, Hippowdon’s weaknesses must be accounted for in teambuilding, especially when considering the set it runs. Whirlwind Hippowdon needs to be paired with something that can handle Ground immune Pokemon like Noivern, Thundurus, and Rotom-H well. Assault Vest Cyclizar and Rotom-H are two Pokemon that can safely switch into them. While Hippowdon is able to switch into strong Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Terrakion and Mienshao when fully healthy, it loses this resilience with even just a little bit of chip damage. Therefore, Hippowdon should be paired with a more sturdy Fighting resistant Pokemon such as Slowbro or Reuniclus. Hippowdon without Whirlwind may require extra support for physical setup sweepers. Choice Scarf users faster than Salamence, such as Mienshao, Terrakion, Gengar, and Hisuian Zoroark, can all fill this role. Non-Stealth Rock Hippowdon should be paired with another Stealth Rock setter such as Empoleon or Jirachi.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Krookodile solidifies its place in the metagame as the premier offensive Ground-type, with access to Stealth Rock and Intimidate giving it great utility for an offensive Pokemon. Krookodile has advantages over other Ground-type entry hazard setters like Flygon and Hippowdon because of its combination of good Speed and access to Knock Off, which helps accumulate hazard chip by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from checks such as Salamence and Slowbro. Taunt helps Krookodile disrupt slower Pokemon trying to setup on it like Air Balloon Revavroom and Shell Smash Blastoise while also being used to prevent other Pokemon like Hippowdon and Galarian Weezing from setting up hazards and using status moves. Gunk Shot helps against switch-ins that would otherwise resist its STAB moves, hitting Chesnaught for super effective damage and Levitate Galarian Weezing for neutral. Leftovers is preferred on Krookodile to passively recover on Pokemon it forces out, giving it more longevity and offsetting Stealth Rock damage. Tera Poison flips the weaknesses to Bug, Fairy, and Fighting into valuable resistances while giving Gunk Shot a STAB boost. Resisting Bug- and Fighting-type attacks is great for Krookodile, allowing it to resist First Impression from Slither Wing and take on Fighting-type Pokemon faster than it such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao. Tera Ghost similarly flips the weaknesses to Bug and Fighting, and allows Krookodile to block Rapid Spin from the tier’s most common hazard removal, Cyclizar.</p> <p>Stealth Rock Krookodile fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate having a more offensive entry hazard setter that is able to force progress with Knock Off, stack hazard chip damage on Heavy-Duty Boots users, and threaten common hazard removal options like Cyclizar, Galarian Weezing, and Noivern. Krookodile appreciates teammates that can switch into super effective attacks from Pokemon trying to revenge kill it like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Okidogi, Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Slither Wing, and defensive switch-ins that threaten it like Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Galarian Weezing. Steel-types  such as Empoleon and Jirachi make for good teammates, resisting Fairy-type attacks from Gardevoir and Fezandipiti that would otherwise threaten Krookodile. Empoleon also covers its Water-type weakness, and Jirachi appreciates having a teammate that can take Dark-type moves for it. Jirachi relies on Covert Cloak users like Slowbro and Fezandipiti getting their item removed to capitalize on its paralysis and flinch chances with Body Slam and Iron Head, respectively. Galarian Weezing is a great teammate for Krookodile, being able to take on Bug- and Fighting-type attacks from Slither Wing, Terrakion, and Mienshao, while threatening back with Strange Steam and Will-O-Wisp, while Krookodile can take on Psychic-type attacks from Reuniclus and Necrozma that threaten Galarian Weezing. Offensive teammates such as Volcanion and Thundurus benefit from Krookodile removing Assault Vest from their most common switch-in, Cyclizar. Volcanion appreciates Krookodile removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Noivern and Salamence, limiting their ability to switch into it.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Reuniclus is a potent late-game cleaner that is difficult to break past for weakened teams. Reuniclus is unable to be dealt with through forms of passive damage such as Spikes, Toxic, and Leech Seed, which many defensive teams rely on to wear down opposing threats. While slow, Reuniclus sports good bulk when invested, allowing it to set up Calm Mind on Pokemon like Chesnaught, Cyclizar, and Slowbro that can't damage it for more than around half of its HP, as it will simply recover off the damage over time and KO them with a boosted STAB move or coverage. Tera complicates this further, as Reuniclus can flip its bad type matchups and set up on Pokemon like Krookodile and Barraskewda that are typically able to threaten it with significant damage. Powerful Pokemon holding boosting items such as Life Orb Mimikyu and Choice Specs Basculegion-F can threaten Reuniclus with strong super effective STAB moves while not being immediately KOed by Reuniclus's own relatively weak attacks before boosting. Reuniclus must also be wary of Encore and Roar from Pokemon such as Jirachi and Empoleon that can switch in and disrupt its boosting before it's strong enough to break the opposing team. Jirachi in particular can flinch Reuniclus down with Iron Head before it has a chance to use Recover. Psychic Noise is chosen as the primary STAB move to thwart both Slowbro and opposing Reuniclus's attempts to heal. It also stops faster defensive walls like Gastrodon and Empoleon from healing for a turn, either letting Reuniclus finish them off or switching to a teammate that forces them out. This keeps special walls from recovering back to full HP, letting Reuniclus outlast them and sweep. Focus Blast hits Dark-types immune to Psychic Noise like Krookodile and Bisharp while slamming Steel-types like Magnezone and Hisuian Goodra. Shadow Ball helps Reuniclus beat variations of Calm Mind Slowbro with Covert Cloak that block Psychic Noise and hits other Psychic-types like Jirachi and opposing Reuniclus. Leftovers helps reduce Reuniclus's reliance on Recover, allowing it to boost more often with Calm Mind or attack once already boosted. Rocky Helmet punishes Jirachi trying to flinch Reuniclus with Iron Head or paralyze it with Body Slam while also wearing down Pokemon with U-turn and Knock Off like Galarian Zapdos and Cyclizar that want to pivot to another teammate or remove Reuniclus's item. Due to Reuniclus having an effective immunity to status like poison, it does not need to use Tera Poison to beat Fezandipiti and Bellibolt and instead can opt for Tera Water or Fairy for their defensive value. Tera Water allows Reuniclus to resist Iron Head from Steel-type checks like Jirachi and Bisharp and rain-boosted Water-type attacks from Barraskewda and Kingdra. Tera Fairy flips Reuniclus's Dark weakness into a resistance, which is helpful for resisting strong Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Bisharp and Krookodile. Bug-types like Yanmega and Slither Wing can be set up on once Reuniclus resists their most powerful STAB moves as well. Tera Fairy also has the additional benefit of an immunity to Dragon Tail users such as Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra looking to phaze it out.</p> <p>Calm Mind Reuniclus offers bulky offense and balanced teams good counterplay to the residual damage of entry hazards as well as an absorber of burn and Toxic poison. For example, Reuniclus can help relieve pressure on Cyclizar to spin away entry hazards because Reuniclus itself does not care about their residual damage. This allows Cyclizar to more freely use Knock Off to remove opposing items and use U-turn to pivot out of switch-ins like Okidogi looking to take advantage of Rapid Spin. Reuniclus is a great switch-in to status spreaders like Slowbro and Galarian Weezing, and as such partners that bait in these Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Barraskewda that can use pivoting moves make good partners, allowing Reuniclus to enter the field and set up. Switching in on status moves like Scald is often advantageous for Reuniclus, as burn or Toxic poison prevents Reuniclus from being paralyzed by its most common check, Jirachi. Reuniclus does not appreciate losing its Leftovers to Cyclizar's Knock Off, so teammates like Okidogi and Terrakion that can switch in on Knock Off and threaten damage on the opponent are good options. Rocky Helmet Chesnaught is another way to punish Knock Off that can set Spikes to chip down Reuniclus's checks while acting as a good check to strong physical attacking Dark-types like Crawdaunt and Bisharp that threaten Reuniclus. Specially defensive Jirachi is a thorn in Reuniclus's side regardless of its coverage option, as it can be flinched down with Iron Head and paralyzed. Basculegion-F, Thundurus, and Magnezone are strong special breakers that don't fear Body Slam paralysis or Iron Head from defensive Jirachi and thus force out the opponent's Jirachi into a teammate that must now absorb a hit from some of the most threatening special attackers in the tier. These three teammates also have pivoting moves in Flip Turn and Volt Switch, letting them choose a teammate to bring in on a predicted Jirachi switch while chipping down the opponent's switch-in in the process.</p>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Defensive Reuniclus finds a place in a metagame lacking phenomenal Dark-types outside of Krookodile and Bisharp and with a myriad of Fighting- and Psychic- types such as Okidogi, Mienshao, and Slowbro. Its bulk and typing allow it to continuously switch into the aforementioned Fighting- and Psychic-types' moves and weaken the opposition while staying healthy with a combination of Recover and Regenerator. It can also act as a crucial member of teams relying on paralysis that enjoy its resistance to Fighting as well as its ability to invite in the likes of Bisharp and Jirachi and cripple them with Thunder Wave. Despite being in competition with Slowbro, Reuniclus's Electric neutrality as well as higher special bulk make it sometimes worth using over Slowbro. Thunder Wave makes it easier for wallbreakers like Volcanion, Okidogi, and Crawdaunt to shine. Psychic Noise is used over the stronger Psychic and Psyshock due to the recovery blocking effect. Knock Off is another excellent support move that forces progress by removing the bevy of Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Focus Blast can be used over Knock Off to deal with Krookodile and Bisharp as well as smacking Empoleon. Tera Water gives Reuniclus an excellent defensive matchup against rain teams and strong Water-type attacks from offensive threats such as Barraskewda, Blastoise, and Volcanion while also removing the weakness to Bug- and Dark-type attacks like U-turn and Knock Off. Tera Fairy turns the aforementioned weaknesses into resistances, gives a Dragon-type immunity against strong threats like Salamence and Noivern, and is generally a good defensive Tera type for a bulkier Pokemon like Reuniclus.</p> <p>Reuniclus fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that enjoy its ability to switch into the myriad of Fighting-type moves in the tier and slow down and soften the opposition with Thunder Wave and Knock Off, respectively. Volcanion and Crawdaunt are great offensive partners for Reuniclus, as they enjoy Reuniclus's ability to slow down the opposition. Fighting-types such as Slither Wing and Okidogi make great offensive and defensive partners for Reuniclus. On the offensive side, they enjoy Reuniclus's Thunder Wave support and its Psychic resistance, while on the defensive side they resist the omnipresent Knock Off and U-turn. Reuniclus also enjoy Palossand, Fezandipiti, Chesnaught and other Fighting-type checks due to its crippling weakness to Knock Off and U-turn. Palossand and Chesnaught are also excellent entry hazard setters and enjoy Reuniclus's Knock Off support. However, since this Reuniclus set doesn't use Magic Guard, it enjoys hazard-removing partners like Cyclizar.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thundurus is an incredibly threatening offensive presence due to its wide array of coverage moves and ability to spread paralysis on would-be switch-ins. It benefits from a lack of specially defensive walls in the tier. Focus Blast chunks common Thundurus checks such as Hisuian Goodra and Assault Vest Cyclizar for a good amount of damage. Knock Off is an alternative utility option for making progress in general by taking away Heavy-Duty Boots, Leftovers, and Assault Vest from defensive switch-ins such as Fezandipiti, Umbreon, and Cyclizar and reducing their longevity. Grass Knot is good for punishing Ground-type switch-ins such as Krookodile and Hippowdon attempting to block Volt Switch or Thunder Wave. Psychic covers a different set of checks in Fezandipiti, Amoonguss, and Chesnaught and pairs well with Focus Blast to keep Thundurus from being completely walled by Krookodile. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Thundurus to pivot throughout the game without suffering Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fairy is useful for denying a Dragon-type STAB move from Hisuian Goodra or Cyclizar in a pinch, removing Thundurus's Stealth Rock weakness, and allowing it to comfortably take common Dark-type attacks such as Knock Off and Bisharp's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Utility Thundurus fits well on a variety of structures, particularly balance and offensive teams that can capitalize on its strong pivot support and paralysis. Useful teammates for Thundurus include Pokemon that can take advantage of paralyzed foes such as Iron Head Jirachi, Hex Gengar, and Hex Basculegion-F as well as setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados that love getting off extra boosts. Wallbreakers such as Okidogi and Conkeldurr pair well with Thundurus, as their middling Speed tiers benefit greatly from paralysis support; moreover, they can comfortably take a hit from and exploit defensive Thundurus checks, particularly Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Wo-Chien, by coming in after a Volt Switch. Thundurus appreciates partners like Cyclizar, Wo-Chien, and Gastrodon that can absorb hits from Electric-type checks such as Magnezone, while Ground-types like Krookodile and Flygon can threaten these same Electric-types offensively. Other paralysis spreaders like Body Slam Jirachi and Thunder Wave Slowbro can be used alongside Thundurus to cripple as much of the opponent's team as possible and provide additional support to the game plan of taking advantage of paralyzed Pokemon. Structures that rely on entry hazards to chip down the opposing team combine well with Thundurus due to its ability to pivot and remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which is supplemented further by additional U-turn or Volt Switch users. Thundurus also benefits from defensive partners such as Hippowdon, Galarian Weezing, and Chesnaught that can easily come in on a Knock Off.</p>"

Since there are no viable Mold Breaker Pokemon in the tier, Disguise almost always guarantees Mimikyu a free turn to set up Swords Dance, which is incredibly valuable. Life Orb provides Mimikyu with much-needed extra firepower that can come in handy when attempting to dispatch offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos and Kleavor or sweep after a Swords Dance. Red Card is an alternative that offers insurance by phazing out bulkier threats and setup sweepers that Mimikyu may not be able to easily take out such as Shell Smash Blastoise, Shift Gear Revavroom, and Throat Spray Yanmega; it also has the added possibility of bringing in a Pokemon like Cyclizar or Slither Wing that Mimikyu could use as setup fodder, in return for decreasing its damage. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed ensures that Mimikyu can outspeed a large chunk of the tier and, in particular, Kleavor and Krookodile. Tera Ghost strengthens Mimikyu's power as a sweeper and allows it to dish out heavy-hitting Shadow Sneak at +2, which can clean worn-down Pokemon like Blastoise, Galarian Zapdos, and Gardevoir.</p> <p>Mimikyu fits best on hyper offense and offensive structures that rely on setup sweepers and strong attackers to overwhelm the opposing team and thus may not have the defensive resources necessary to easily take out a fast revenge killer or prevent a reverse sweep. Other notable setup sweepers such as Shell Smash Blastoise, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Shift Gear Revavroom pair well with Mimikyu by chunking holes in the opposing team and possibly removing some of its key defensive checks such as Hippowdon and Talonflame, thus bolstering Mimikyu's ability to clean late-game. Mimikyu can act as a decent spinblocker against teams reliant on Cyclizar for entry hazard removal. It also appreciates its own hazards support, thus pairing well with Stealth Rock leads such as Kleavor and Terrakion, as they ease Mimikyu's job as a cleaner by wearing out the opposing team, which brings them closer to KO range after a Swords Dance. Mimikyu synergizes well with Future Sight users such as Slowbro and Reuniclus, as it prevents some of Mimikyu's common Poison-type checks like Galarian Weezing and Okidogi from switching in. Status spreader partners such as Thunder Wave Thundurus and Will-O-Wisp Galarian Weezing can cripple offensive threats such as Armarouge, Kleavor, and Okidogi, which gives Mimikyu more opportunities to pull off a sweep.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Weakness Policy Armarouge is a naturally potent wallbreaker and sweeper that can immediately chunk holes in the opposing team thanks to its excellent STAB combination and decent bulk. Armarouge can use the combination of Endure and Weakness Policy to flip situations around at the drop of a hat and threaten a devastating sweep. Armor Cannon is the centerpiece of Armarouge's arsenal as a wallbreaker due to its high Base Power and its drawbacks made negligible by having Endure as an option. Stored Power can deal incredible amounts of damage after a Weakness Policy and Weak Armor activation, with the drawback of initially being very weak. Expanding Force is an option on Psychic Terrain teams that can OHKO most non-resistant foes in the tier while Psychic Terrain is active and is still a decently powerful attack otherwise. Energy Ball provides Armarouge with coverage that is essential for dealing with Water-types such as Slowbro and Suicune. Calm Mind is an optional setup move that allows Armarouge to capitalize on Pokemon that cannot deal much damage to it like Cyclizar, Fezandipiti, and Galarian Weezing and keeps it from being dependent on Weakness Policy for strengthening its attacks. Weak Armor allows Armarouge to outspeed a massive portion of the tier after surviving a physical attack, thus enabling it to act as an excellent late-game cleaner. A Timid nature ensures that Armarouge outspeeds even the fastest Choice Scarf users in the tier, such as Terrakion and Gengar, at +2. Tera Ground makes Armarouge immune to Sandstorm damage and also lets it deny Thunder Wave and Electric-type moves from Pokemon such as Thundurus, Jirachi, and Reuniclus, which gives it time to either setup further or pick up a KO. Tera Normal can be used to turn the tables on a Ghost-type revenge killer like Gengar or Mimikyu. Tera Psychic boosts the damage of Armarouge's strong Psychic-type attacks even further and is particularly useful in Psychic Terrain.</p> <p>Weakness Policy Armarouge fits well on hyper offense and offensive structures that appreciate a safety net that can revenge kill a Choice item user such as Galarian Zapdos or Krookodile if needed and possibly sweep in return. Armarouge can also cover the role of a wallbreaker and cleaner on balance structures that aim to gradually chip away at the opposing team due to its innate firepower and ability to quickly boost its Speed. Armarouge synergizes particularly well with Psychic Terrain and thus partners well with lead Psychic Surge Indeedee; not only does Psychic Terrain power up Armarouge's Psychic-type STAB attacks to unstoppable levels, it also stops Armarouge from being revenge killed with a priority move, which is often its biggest worry after a successful Endure. Armarouge often finds its itself lacking meaningful ways to deal with specially defensive walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Hisuian Goodra and therefore benefits from strong physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Terrakion and Shift Gear Revavroom and, on bulkier structures, wallbreakers such as Choice Band Okidogi, as they can help to remove or deal large chunks of damage to Armarouge's checks. Armarouge benefits from hazard removal options such as Tidy Up Maushold and Rapid Spin Cyclizar, as they can prevent it from losing its health to entry hazard chip, thus keeping it from being dependent on Endure for surviving attacks. Armarouge works well with fast pivots such as Choice Scarf Jirachi and Cyclizar that can bait a Knock Off from weak physical attackers such as Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Chesnaught and use it against them to threaten a devastating sweep by activating Weakness Policy.</p>"

Setting up is made easier with its ability, Filter, which allows it to take a Flamethrower from Pokemon like Galarian Weezing and Noivern. Revavroom also has access to useful coverage moves that allow it to threaten Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types. Nevertheless, Revavroom is quite frail, as its poor Special Defense and reliance on Air Balloon to set up can be exploited by Ground-types, especially Hippowdon, Krookodile, Quagsire, and Palossand, as they can take a +1 hit from full HP and OHKO it back.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Revavroom can opt to run Tera Blast Grass, which threatens Water- and Ground-types such as Slowbro, Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Krookodile. Temper Flare is also an option to take down Steel-types with a Ground immunity such as Bronzong and Tera Steel Rotom-H, as well as helping against opposing Revavroom. Temper Flare can also be boosted with Tera Fire, making Revavroom immune to burn. Finally, Taunt is a solid option to completely wall and set up on Quagsire and Whirlwind Hippowdon with Air Balloon as well as to block Will-O-Wisp from Galarian Weezing. Tera Flying + Taunt is a good combination to completely shut down Whirlwind Hippowdon and Quagsire even after Air Balloon breaks. Revavroom can also opt to run Leftovers + Magnet Rise to get rid of its Ground weakness and set up on Ground-types more easily. Clear Amulet can also be used to block Intimidate from Krookodile and Salamence. Toxic is an option to put bulky Fire- and Water-type switch-ins on a timer. Toxic Spikes allows Revavroom to take advantage of the free turns it generates. Toxic and Toxic Spikes could be used on a Choice Scarf Revavroom set, which could be a decent source of role compression also capable of pivoting using Parting Shot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Levitate Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types with Levitate are immune to Gunk Shot and High Horsepower and resist Iron Head. As such, Pokemon such as Bronzong and Tera Steel Rotom-H are the sturdiest answers to Revavroom.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Revavroom fails to KO bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Palossand even after a Shift Gear boost, and they threaten to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Quagsire, and Gastrodon deal with Revavroom quite well, potentially burning it with Scald in Slowbro's case or outright KOing it with Ground-type STAB moves in Quagsire and Gastrodon's cases.

Iron Head gives it a reliable STAB move that also hits Ground-types. Tera Ground gives Revavroom an additional STAB move in High Horsepower, which allows it to grab crucial OHKOs such as Bisharp, Volcanion, and Fezandipiti after one Shift Gear boost.</p> <p>Revavroom is a staple on hyper offense teams, and its role is usually to clean late-game. Therefore, it prefers wallbreakers and other setup sweepers such as Terrakion, Basculegion-F, Shell Smash Blastoise, and Yanmega as partners. The usual gameplan with Revavroom is wearing down Steel- and Fire-types with it, allowing another sweeper such as Mimikyu or Blastoise to clean. The opposite is also true, as Blastoise and Yanmega can weaken bulky Ground- and Water-types for Revavroom to sweep late-game. Revavroom should usually be brought in after a teammate has been KOed to ensure that Air Balloon remains intact and it is at near full health, as it is frail defensively.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam is an option as Cyclizar's STAB move so it can fish for paralysis instead of doing more damage with Draco Meteor or Double-Edge. On teams that may have a hard time dealing with Gastrodon and Swampert, Cyclizar can run Power Whip to threaten a 2HKO on both of them. Overheat is an option for Cyclizars looking to supercharge its matchup against Forretress and Bisharp.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Priority</strong>: Common Choice Scarf users like Okidogi, Mienshao, and Krookodile can switch in and threaten to OHKO Cyclizar with Close Combat or take advantage of its need to switch out by using Knock Off or U-turn for free progress. Gardevoir is another common Choice Scarf user that can severely hamper Cyclizar's utility role with Trick. Bisharp can OHKO it at +2 with Sucker Punch, and Slither Wing threatens to KO with First Impression if Cyclizar has taken some chip.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types block Rapid Spin and prevent Cyclizar from doing its most impartant job. Palossand isn't very threatened by Knock Off and can completely roadblock Cyclizar's efforts to remove hazards while setting its own up. Mimikyu is a Ghost-type that isn't weak to Knock Off and is immune to Draco Meteor, meaning it can set up Swords Dance for free while Cyclizar is forced to escape. Basculegion-F is a particular nuisance, as it can spinblock Cyclizar while also taking advantage of Knock Off with its Weakness Policy set. Tera Ghost on hazard setters such as Chesnaught, Empoleon, and Hippowdon can also put Cyclizar in a bind, denying it Rapid Spin removal.</p> <p><strong>Setup Pokemon</strong>: Most setup Pokemon can take advantage of Cyclizar's relative weakness and lack of status to set up in front of it, as long as it isn't running Taunt or Dragon Tail. Bisharp, Revavroom, and Terrakion can take advantage of Cyclizar's passivity and set up in front of it.</p>",

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Cyclizar can safely switch into most special attackers and provide opportunities for its teammates to enter the game thanks to U-turn. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards while also granting Cyclizar a boost to Speed, which helps it outspeed most Choice Scarf users in the tier like Gardevoir and Gengar. It also gives even a paralyzed Cyclizar the opportunity to pivot out of slower opponents like Empoleon and Hippowdon. Knock Off can hit the tier's Pyschic-types such as Reuniclus and Slowbro for decent damage while also threatening the frail Ghost-types like Gengar and Hisuian Zoroark. Draco Meteor can be used to hit physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Dragon Tail is great at forcing opposing setup sweepers like Cresselia and Slowbro out. Facade can take advantage of status like burn or paralysis that Cyclizar may be inflicted by throughout the course of a game from opposing Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Thundurus. Assault Vest helps with its otherwise low natural bulk, which is also helped significantly by Regenerator recovery. Timid maximum Speed Cyclizar is faster than the majority of the tier, and the bulk provided allows it to survive a +2 Modest Blastoise Ice Beam along with taking two Ice Beams or Sludge Waves from other threats such as Basculegion-F and Gengar, respectively. Tera Fairy flips Cyclizar's weakness to Dragon-type moves into an immunity and gives a resistance to Fighting-type moves, helping against opposing Cyclizar, Salamence, and Slither Wing. Tera Steel makes Cyclizar resistant to Fairy- and Ice-type moves from the likes of Gardevoir and Empoleon, respectively. Tera Ghost makes it immune to Normal-type, allowing it to stop Rapid Spin attempts from opposing Cyclizar, while adding an immunity to Fighting-type attacks as well.</p> <p>Assault Vest Cyclizar can reliably slot onto balance or bulky offense teams as the main form of entry hazard removal while also providing item removal and pivoting. It can also be used on stall teams, though these structures often want another hazard removal option such as Defog Talonflame to reliably maintain hazard control. Cyclizar pairs well with other Regenerator Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Mienshao, and Slowbro, creating teams that are very difficult to break offensively and can provide pressure through status, hazard chip, and gradual damage. Strong offensive teammates like Crawdaunt, Conkeldurr, and Volcanion appreciate Cyclizar giving them free entry points. While Cyclizar can often keep hazards off the field, it is advised to still run hazard-resilient or Heavy-Duty Boots teammates, such as Amoonguss, Hisuian Goodra, and Mienshao, since Cyclizar may struggle against teams with Ghost-types like Palossand or Mimikyu. Assault Vest Cyclizar can struggle to retain HP against hazard-stacking archetypes, being unable to remove hazards against teams utilizing Tera Ghost on their hazard setters. To mitigate this dynamic, Cyclizar relies on pivoting into teammates who can apply offensive pressure to deny hazards from being established, like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Volcanion.</p>"

      "Heavy-Duty Boots": {
        "description": "<p>While usually overshadowed by the more prevalent Assault Vest set, running Heavy-Duty Boots on Cyclizar can offer meaningful benefits, allowing access to utility moves, while also making Regenerator more beneficial without needing to worry about the passive chip that comes with its usage as a spinner. Cyclizar is a master at providing utility for a team, boasting Knock Off to remove items from foes for other members of a team to take advantage of, with Heavy-Duty Boots users like Fezandipiti or Slowbro being great examples of Knock Off's usefulness over the course of a game. U-turn provides a way for Cyclizar to get out of sketchy matchups, being able to use the move safely against most of the tier with its phenomenal Speed stat. Taunt can shut down recovery or setup from foes that believe they can take advantage of the presumed passivity of Cyclizar, such as Hippowdon and Revavroom. Double-Edge can be slotted over Taunt if more damage is desired from Cyclizar, providing a harder-hitting STAB move than Rapid Spin, and its recoil is also somewhat negated with the HP gained back from Regenerator. Tera Ghost provides a last ditch-effort of escape against Fighting-types, one of Cyclizar's sketchier matchups, which is especially prevalent with the large amount of Fighting-type moves present in the tier, like Close Combat from various abusers including Okidogi and Zapdos-Galar; however, Cyclizar is generally the last thing you want to Terastalize unless in truly dire straits, as Terastallization is usually far more effective and useful on other members of a team. Tera Ghost can also deny opposing spinners from removing entry hazards, keeping pressure on opposing teams throughout a game and additionally providing momentum through a wasted Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Cyclizar fits on almost all team structures, with the main exception being hyper offense, as its role as a spinner with access to Regenerator makes it extremely reliable at removing entry hazards throughout the course of a game. To get the best use out of Cyclizar's utility, pairing it up with a Stealth Rock setter is extremely important, as Cyclizar's Knock Off makes opposing teams weaker to hazards; this can either be with allies like Hippowdon, or it can be run with Palossand on teams dedicated to hazard stacking. Additionally, pairing Cyclizar up with offensive options that can take advantage of the momentum that U-turn provides, with notable wallbreakers including Choice Band Okidogi and Volcanion being perfect teammates. Cyclizar is somewhat frail by itself, so pairing it up with defensive presences like the aforementioned physically defensive Stealth Rock setters, along with more specially defensive options like Empoleon, creates strong defensive cores that can be difficult to break and can wear down teams through a war of attrition. These defensive cores can be furthered with Regenerator cores, constantly keeping teammates healthy throughout a match, with notable teammates being Amoonguss, Slowbro, Mienshao, and Reuniclus. Pairing Cyclizar up with multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users is also wise, as it can have problems against dedicated spinblockers, with Palossand on hazard-stacking teams and Mimikyu on hyper offense builds.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Despite its mediocre offensive stats, Fezandipiti leverages its excellent bulk, good defensive typing, and signature Toxic Chain ability to be a threatening late-game cleaner while also serving as a solid part of its team's defensive backbone. Fezandipiti's 4x resistance to Fighting makes it an excellent answer to Pokemon like Mienshao and Slither Wing, and its immunity to Dragon and great Special Defense make it a great switch-in to Salamence and Noivern, all of which it can take advantage of to set up Calm Mind or fire off its Toxic-spreading attacks. Fezandipiti does have several weaknesses to common types in the tier, however, like the Ground-type Hippowdon and Swampert and the Psychic-type Gardevoir and Armarouge, all of which are able to survive a Moonblast and threaten Fezandipiti back with super effective attacks. There are many Calm Mind users that Fezandipiti can thrive against such as Suicune and Raikou, but Covert Cloak Slowbro and Magic Guard Reuniclus can reliably win the matchup unless Fezandipiti Terastallizes into an advantageous type and uses Taunt to prevent them from boosting.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heat Wave allows Fezandipiti to hit the Steel-types that typically wall it for super effective damage, reducing its reliance on teammates to answer them. Nasty Plot boosts Fezandipiti's Special Attack faster than Calm Mind, making it a more immediate threat with maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs as well as Heat Wave. Fezandipiti has other options for Tera types, such as Steel, which allows it to resist Terrakion's Stone Edge and Gardevoir's Psychic. Tera Electric grants Fezandipiti resistances to Thundurus's Thunderbolt and Galarian Zapdos's Brave Bird while also making it immune to the paralysis inflicted by Jirachi and Thundurus. Fezandipiti also has the option to drop Calm Mind and run more bulk to take a utility role with moves such as Toxic, which is more reliable than Toxic Chain, and Alluring Voice, which is weaker than Moonblast but can punish faster setup sweepers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Empoleon, Magnezone, and Revavroom resist Moonblast, are immune to being poisoned, and can threaten Fezandipiti with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Amoonguss and Tentacruel resist Moonblast, cannot be poisoned, and can use disruptive moves like Clear Smog and Haze to remove Fezandipiti's boosts. Galarian Slowbro can use Psyshock to get around Fezandipiti's Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical threats like Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos as well as Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Okidogi can outspeed Fezandipiti and deal significant damage to it or KO if it is not healthy enough.</p> <p><strong>Jirachi</strong>: Jirachi in particular is a threat to Fezandipiti due to a combination of its Steel typing, good stats, and variety of disruptive tools. Flinches from super effective Iron Head, paralysis from Body Slam and Thunder Wave, Psychic Noise, Encore, and Trick can all stop an unprepared Fezandipiti in its tracks. Calm Mind Jirachi also beats non-Taunt Fezandipiti, and Doom Desire and Future Sight can prevent a safe entry.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Roost is used to keep Fezandipiti's HP high while it sets up. U-turn allows Fezandipiti to pivot out of unfavorable matchups while potentially applying Toxic thanks to its ability. Taunt is used to prevent opposing Pokemon from using their own setup or healing moves, taking advantage of Fezandipiti's Speed to act first and deny its foe the chance to move. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Fezandipiti from being worn down by entry hazards, improving its longevity. Covert Cloak is primarily used to protect Fezandipiti from Jirachi's Iron Head flinches and Body Slam paralysis as well as Psychic Noise from Slowbro and Reuniclus after Terastallizing, but it also appreciates the effect on moves such as Gardevoir's Moonblast and Salamence's Hurricane. With a Timid nature and 200 Speed EVs, Fezandipiti is fast enough to outspeed Krookodile, which threatens it with strong STAB Earthquake but is vulnerable to Fezandipiti's Moonblast. Terastallizing into the Water-type turns Fezandipiti's Steel weakness into a resistance, allowing it to better take on foes like Jirachi, Hisuian Goodra, and Bisharp, and its lack of weaknesses allows Fezandipiti to survive most neutral hits from other threats. Tera Fairy removes Fezandipiti's Ground and Psychic weaknesses, giving it better matchups against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Reuniclus, while maintaining its important resistances to Fighting and Dark so it can still to switch into Close Combat and Knock Off from Pokemon like Okidogi, Mienshao, Slither Wing, and Crawdaunt. The damage boost from Tera Fairy also guarantees that Moonblast can OHKO Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Terrakion after one Calm Mind.</p> <p>Fezandipiti fits best on balance or bulky offense teams that can chip its checks down across the game and enable a sweep. Knock Off from Cyclizar, Mienshao, and Galarian Zapdos can remove Leftovers from Jirachi and Empoleon to make the lower damage of Fezandipiti's attacks more meaningful as well as Covert Cloak from Slowbro, allowing Toxic Chain to affect it. Fezandipiti benefits from a VoltTurn core with teammates like Cyclizar, Slither Wing, and Magnezone, and it can join in if running U-turn. Magnet Pull Magnezone is a useful teammate, capable of forcing damage onto Steel-types like Bisharp and Jirachi that Fezandipiti can struggle to break through, and U-turn pivoting can ensure Magnezone is able to attack these targets. Fezandipiti works best with teammates that can take the super effective Ground-, Psychic-, and Steel-type attacks that threaten it, such as Noivern, Slowbro, and Empoleon. The Pokemon that want to switch in against Fezandipiti are often vulnerable to Spikes, as Jirachi and Hisuian Goodra lack reliable recovery and typically run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots, so setters such as Chesnaught, Klefki, and Quagsire are valuable.</p>"
