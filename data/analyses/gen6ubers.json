  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gengar is able to maintain a valuable niche in the Uber tier with Shadow Tag, which allows it to trap and remove foes. This makes Mega Gengar, albeit situationally, a stallbreaker, wallbreaker, and revenge killer rolled into one. Its excellent Special Attack and Speed stats aid it in this role, as do utility moves such as Taunt and Destiny Bond. Gengar's defensive typing along with its initial ability Levitate grants it three immunities, allowing it to come into battle a bit more easily. However, Mega Gengar's paltry bulk does it no favors, especially in an offensively inclined metagame. It is also susceptible to Pursuit, although this can be circumvented with the appropriate moves. Mega Gengar is often forced to sacrifice itself with Destiny Bond if it wishes to remove a healthy threat, and it faces indirect competition from other Mega Evolutions. It is worth noting that losing Levitate lets it absorb Toxic Spikes upon switching in and that it is able to spinblock, two small but situationally useful traits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect Type lets Gengar survive Pursuit from common users of the move such as Tyranitar and Scizor if it hits them on the switch. A specialized moveset of Reflect Type / Will-O-Wisp / Rest / Taunt can remove said Pursuit trappers efficiently, but it has little utility outside of that. The Hex set can generally beat Pursuit trappers with Will-O-Wisp and the appropriate coverage move anyway. Sludge Bomb can be used over Sludge Wave, as the increased chance of poison can be worth the 5 Base Power drop under certain circumstances.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Mega Gengar is difficult to check in the traditional sense, as it can usually choose its matchups favorably with Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit users can trap Gengar on the turn it Mega Evolves, thereby preventing it from removing a Pokemon of its choice. However, Mega Gengar can still eliminate the Pursuit user with Destiny Bond, and Tyranitar is generally OHKOed by Focus Blast, while Mega Scizor is OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon are unaffected by Shadow Tag, allowing them to switch out freely against Mega Gengar. Giratina-O and Aegislash can also threaten Mega Gengar with STAB Shadow Sneak and have enough special bulk to survive a Shadow Ball from Mega Gengar, OHKOing it in return.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Super effective priority moves, such as Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak, usually OHKO Mega Gengar before it can react. However, Sucker Punch fails if Mega Gengar does not attack and can still be exploited with Destiny Bond. Given its poor bulk, Bullet Punch can pick off a weakened Mega Gengar too.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf users can typically outspeed and OHKO Mega Gengar, allowing them to revenge kill it or force it out on a double switch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A, Ubers's resident fast Psychic-type powerhouses, can outspeed and dispatch Mega Gengar, as can Deoxys-S if it carries Psycho Boost. Healthy Dragon Dance users such as Rayquaza and Mega Salamence can force Mega Gengar to risk a prediction between Taunt and Destiny Bond, as can Speed Boost Blaziken. Mewtwo forces a Speed tie with Mega Gengar, which it generally does not want to risk.</p> <p><strong>Shed Shell</strong>: Shed Shell allows a Pokemon to escape Shadow Tag freely but has no other utility.</p>",

      "Hex Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set takes advantage of the large amount of status in the ORAS Ubers metagame and is even capable of spreading status itself. Hex allows Mega Gengar to do severe damage, as it reaches 130 Base Power after an opposing Pokemon has been afflicted with a status condition. On top of this, Ghost is an effective offensive typing in this metagame, so most Pokemon will be hit extremely hard by a boosted Hex. Focus Blast provides Mega Gengar with solid coverage, allowing it to quickly KO Pokemon such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Darkrai. Protect allows Gengar to safely Mega Evolve, and reliably trap the aforementioned threats. Protect also racks up chip damage on the foe if it is already burned or poisoned. The final move slot is usually dedicated to Will-O-Wisp, which powers up Hex and allows Mega Gengar to deal with Pursuit trappers such as Aegislash and Tyranitar far more easily. However, Mega Gengar can opt to run Sludge Bomb for trapping Fairies such as Xerneas and Clefable. Finally, Destiny Bond can potentially take out one of your opponent's Pokemon, but it is difficult to find room for it on this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As this set handles Pursuit trappers well, Gengar has an easier time removing intended targets than standard Mega Gengar. However, due to the loss of coverage from not running Sludge Bomb, it has less targets to trap; if you opt for Sludge Bomb, though, this set functions the same way the standard set does, although it will require more team support to spread status ailments. Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs optimize damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure you play Mega Gengar carefully, as the lack of Destiny Bond on this set means that it cannot simply sacrifice itself to remove a member of your opponent's team. If you misplay there's a chance it will accomplish absolutely nothing. Against offensive teams, Mega Gengar usually won't use Will-O-Wisp at all (assuming it has it), so it plays like standard Mega Gengar, only trading the ability to use Destiny Bond for the potential boosted Hexes. Hex can allow Mega Gengar to OHKO Pokemon it wouldn't have been able to otherwise, such as Mega Salamence after prior Stealth Rock damage. Against defensive teams, it can PP stall Pokemon such as Blissey (assuming it lacks an attack that can hit Gengar) despite not having Taunt. It can also cripple walls such as support Arceus formes and Lugia before hitting them extremely hard with Hex.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp is mainly for burning Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Aegislash on the switch, although if Mega Gengar is healthy it can survive a hit and then burn certain support Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Water, before attacking them with boosted Hexes. In general, Mega Gengar greatly appreciates its teammates spreading status ailments instead of being forced to use its valuable turns spreading ailments itself. U-turn and Volt Switch can help give Mega Gengar some opportunities to come in and remove certain threats with either Hex or a coverage move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can spread status ailments easily, such as Klefki and support Primal Groudon, make for excellent partners, as they can help boost of power of Mega Gengar's Hex. Thunder Wave can also slow down Pokemon that can outrun or Speed tie Mega Gengar, such as Mewtwo and its Mega Evolutions. Swords Dance Arceus-Ground can take advantage of Mega Gengar's ability to remove Skarmory and Bronzong while checking Primal Groudon in return. Similarly, Extreme Killer Arceus appreciates the removal of Pokemon such as Skarmory and Arceus-Rock. Ho-Oh checks a large portion of the metagame, including some Steel-types such as Klefki that Mega Gengar might have trouble trapping or might not want to risk removing while spreading burns with Sacred Fire. Hex Giratina-O is a cool partner, despite sharing Mega Gengar's Ghost typing, as it can spread status ailments of its own. Together, Mega Gengar and Giratina-O can break down certain Pokemon and help each other check certain threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can provide much appreciated U-turn support to potentially get Mega Gengar in for free on Pokemon such as Lugia and Skarmory, and it can also check Primal Groudon adequately. Xerneas is a reasonable alternative to Klefki on a more offensively inclined team, as it can destroy Yveltal and Arceus-Dark for Mega Gengar. Finally, bulky support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon can provide defensive synergy by checking Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. If a support Arceus forme can hinder Primal Groudon's staying power with Toxic, Mega Gengar can potentially remove it later on in the match.</p>"

      "Offensive Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Destiny Bond is an indispensable support move that goes hand-in-glove with Shadow Tag, allowing Mega Gengar to force trades with a number of offensive and defensive threats alike. Sludge Wave is Mega Gengar's strongest Poison-type STAB move and conveniently hits Fairy-types super effectively, allowing it to eliminate them from high health. Shadow Ball is Mega Gengar's most consistent STAB move and hits slower Psychic-types such as Latias, Latios, Lugia, and Aegislash super effectively while dealing respectable damage to other Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Diancie. Focus Blast allows Mega Gengar to dispatch Tyranitar and Ferrothorn along with a few other Pokemon. Taunt complements Destiny Bond and Shadow Tag by forcing a trapped opponent to use an attacking move, in turn letting Mega Gengar use a risk-free Destiny Bond the following turn. Protect guarantees Gengar's Mega Evolution and can be used to scout and lock uncommon Choice item users. It is also a good choice for teams that struggle against Jolly Extreme Killer Arceus to let Mega Gengar safely gain the Speed advantage.</p> <p>Substitute helps grant Gengar a safe Mega Evolution and eases prediction, notably against users of Thunder Wave that can also deal hefty damage to Gengar. Thunder is Gengar's strongest option for hitting such relevant threats as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre. Icy Wind is the safest option against a healthy Mega Salamence or Rayquaza. Hidden Power Fire hits Mega Scizor, which commonly runs Pursuit, and Ferrothorn for heavy damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs along with a Timid nature make the best use of Mega Gengar's base 130 Speed by allowing it to outrun threats such as Arceus, Darkrai, and Shaymin-S. 252 Special Attack EVs let Mega Gengar hit as hard as possible and allow it to usually OHKO standard Geomancy Xerneas with Sludge Wave. Siphoning 88 EVs from Special Attack into HP lets Mega Gengar survive Geomancy Xerneas's +2 Moonblast, but the loss in power is generally not worth it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Actively bringing Gengar in via double switching is key to using it effectively. Double switch Gengar in on bulky Pokemon you can remove, as dry switching Gengar in exposes it to getting slapped with a status affliction. Gengar can also be double switched into weakened offensive threats that you predict will switch in to throw out a final blow. A timely double switch can grant Gengar a safe Mega Evolution, as it has three immunities and resists Fairy-type moves. Mega Gengar can also be brought in for free against a target of its choice if you sacrifice one of your Pokemon against the foe you want to trap. Be wary of Choice Scarf users, notably Xerneas, that can surprise and 2HKO Gengar. From Team Preview, assess what Pokemon Gengar should best take down (if any) to benefit its teammates, and plan your game accordingly, as opposed to blindly making trades with Destiny Bond.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar appreciates teammates that handle the common Ghost-types in the tier, as these can bypass Shadow Tag. Ho-Oh pressures Arceus-Ghost and deals hefty damage to Giratina-O with Brave Bird, while Yveltal checks Ghost-types in general. Switch-ins for Dark-types such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark are also required, as these can otherwise force a Destiny Bond that might be better saved for late-game; accordingly, Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Klefki make good teammates. Setup sweepers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and a Calm Mind Arceus forme can exploit Mega Gengar's trapping capabilities and blow through weakened teams. It is effective to pair Mega Gengar with another wallbreaker to pick apart defensive cores for a sweeper to tear through late-game; Ho-Oh is a good teammate, as are other hard hitters such as Primal Kyogre. Users of U-turn, especially Yveltal, can allow Mega Gengar to successfully pivot into the very Fairy-types it wants to trap.</p>"
      },
      "Perish Trapper (Rick Gastly)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Gengar can make use of the combination of Perish Song and Shadow Tag to trap and eliminate opposing defensive Pokemon, mono attackers, and users of a Choice item. Protect is used to guarantee Mega Evolution and allows Mega Gengar to prevent damage every other turn as it stalls for Perish Song turns. Taunt is used to prevent the use of Roar or Whirlwind, and it also prevents moves such as Thunder Wave and Spikes, which can respectively cripple Mega Gengar or otherwise harm its team. Substitute can ease the use of Perish Song after an opponent switches out their Gengar-weak Pokemon. It can also be used repeatedly against slower foes to stall for Perish Song turns; this is particularly effective against threats that have multiple moves that can KO Mega Gengar. Disable forces Choice-locked Pokemon to use Struggle and can rob attackers of the means to hit Mega Gengar, making it easier to stall for Perish Song turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to mitigate the mediocrity of Mega Gengar's bulk and aid in its ability to survive until Perish Song activates. 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Mega Gengar to be faster than maximum Speed Arceus formes after Mega Evolution. The remaining 84 EVs are allocated to Special Defense; this allows Mega Gengar to better take arbitrary special attacks. Specifically, they allow it to always survive a +2 Moonblast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock and frequently survive +2 Thunder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gengar cannot trap anything until it has Mega Evolved safely; do this by getting Mega Gengar into play early in the match. Make smart double switches or sacrifice an unneeded Pokemon to get Mega Gengar in for free against a target of choice. Against a defensive Pokemon such as Lugia, support Arceus, or defensive Xerneas, use Taunt first to prevent Mega Gengar from being phazed or crippled by status. If the foe only has one good method of dealing damage to Mega Gengar and has just used the move, Disable it. Slower Choice users that have already locked themselves into a move can be Disabled immediately; otherwise, use Protect after trapping them, and then use Disable. Once threats have been neutered, Perish Song can be set. Subsequently, use Protect to stall until the Perish Count reaches 1. Switch out after the Perish Count reaches 1 to prevent Mega Gengar from fainting alongside its trapped foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to this set's ability to trap and eliminate many common Defoggers, Spikes users such as Deoxys-A, Deoxys-S, Forretress, Scolipede, Greninja, and Klefki can make the entry hazard game difficult for the opponent. Offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Primal Groudon, Dialga, and Deoxys-S also greatly benefit from Mega Gengar's ability to eliminate foes that can Defog away entry hazards. Setup sweepers such as Xerneas, Primal Groudon, and Rayquaza benefit from the pressure Mega Gengar can place on defensive support Pokemon such as support Arceus formes, Clefable, Blissey, and Klefki. Primal Kyogre is a teammate that appreciates Mega Gengar's ability to remove Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Arceus": {
    "overview": "<p>With a strong priority move, fantastic 120 base stats across the board, and a wide array of coverage moves, Arceus makes for an effective late-game sweeper that can easily set up and sweep once its checks and counters have been weakened. However, a huge part of Arceus's viability also comes from its ability to serve as a very strong revenge killer for its team, taking out weakened offensive threats with its Life Orb Extreme Speed. Arceus also pairs well with other offensive behemoths such as Primal Groudon, Xerneas, Darkrai, and Mega Salamence, easing its ability to fit onto offensive teams. Arceus fares well against a variety of offensive threats due to having a strong priority move in Extreme Speed and various coverage options. Arceus also appreciates the decline of Will-O-Wisp support Arceus, non-Primal Groudon, and Landorus-T in the generation transition, competent checks in XY. However, a new check in Mega Salamence has been introduced, and old checks such as Mega Gengar are still troublesome.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers is an interesting item choice on the 240 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Spe EV spread, especially for teams that struggle with Mega Diancie, enabling Extreme Killer Arceus to use it as setup fodder. The increase in longevity also helps it to get extra Swords Dance boosts in. Although Arceus is considerably weaker with Leftovers, it can deal with Choice Scarf Xerneas better and still set up in a similar manner.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Arceus-Ghost</strong>: Arceus-Ghost can at worst Speed tie with Arceus if both are running maximum Speed, survives a +2 Shadow Claw, and cripples Arceus with Will-O-Wisp. It can falter against Refresh variants, however. Focus Blast Arceus-Ghost is capable of dealing immediate damage to Arceus as well.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Yveltal</strong>: Yveltal survives anything except +2 Life Orb Stone Edge, which has a small chance to OHKO from full health and is a guaranteed KO after Stealth Rock. Yveltal can OHKO +2 Arceus in return with Black Glasses-boosted Foul Play or KO with Foul Play after Stealth Rock damage, a round of Rocky Helmet recoil or a round of Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: With proper investment, Giratina-O can survive a +2 Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock and can either cripple Arceus with Will-O-Wisp or phaze it with Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia is insurmountable if its Multiscale is intact, easily phazing Arceus. It can also Roost back to Multiscale even while taking +2 Shadow Claws. However, +2 Life Orb Stone Edge can OHKO after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp Arceus</strong>: Arceus formes such as Ground and Fairy can take a +2 attack and burn Arceus with Will-O-Wisp, crippling it. Arceus-Rock resists Extreme Speed but risks losing the Speed tie and getting KOed by +2 Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: Sableye can Prankster Will-O-Wisp to cripple Arceus and can deal severe damage with Foul Play, OHKOing if Arceus tries to Swords Dance again after getting burned. Mega Sableye can also take a +2 Life Orb Earthquake and retaliate with Foul Play or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Salamence</strong>: With Intimidate before Mega Evolving and huge physical bulk after Mega Evolving, Salamence can win one-on-one if Stealth Rock is not on the field, 2HKOing with Return or at worst dealing huge damage with Double-Edge or Return. It falls to Ice Beam or boosted Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage, however.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mewtwo X</strong>: Mega Mewtwo X can be EVed to survive Arceus's +2 Life Orb Extreme Speed and can OHKO Arceus with Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar outspeeds Arceus and can either heavily damage it with Focus Blast or give its life to take Arceus down with Destiny Bond. It is outsped and KOed by Jolly variants if it has not already Mega Evolved, however.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Scizor</strong>: Skarmory completely walls any Arceus variant without a Fire move, phazing it while barely taking a scratch. Scizor can take a +2 Earthquake reasonably well and deal heavy damage to Arceus with Superpower. Ferrothorn can rack up residual damage on Arceus with Leech Seed, Iron Barbs, and Protect, but it does not take +2 Earthquake very well and runs the risk of letting Arceus set up Swords Dance on its Protects. All three of these Steel-types are also promptly KOed by Fire Blast or Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Clefable</strong>: Physically defensive Unaware Clefable ignores any Swords Dance boosts, takes less than half from Extreme Speed, and can slowly stall Arceus out with either Moonblast or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Genesect</strong>: Genesect resists Extreme Speed and can either deal heavy damage with Explosion or revenge kill a very weak Arceus with a faster Extreme Speed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Extreme Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance grants Arceus the ability to double its Attack, allowing it to OHKO various Pokemon such as Mewtwo and offensive Yveltal with little or no prior damage. Extreme Speed allows Arceus to bypass Speed tiers and Choice Scarf users, and it can and should be used to revenge kill offensive Pokemon such as Darkrai, Xerneas, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Blaziken once they have been even slightly weakened. Earthquake should be used to break through Primal Groudon as well as Steel- and Rock-types, namely Dialga, Arceus-Rock, and Mega Diancie, while Shadow Claw is used to break through Lugia and Ghost-types, namely Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O. Stone Edge is an equally viable alternate option to Shadow Claw that hit Lugia, defensive Yveltal, Mega Salamence and Ho-Oh with one moveslot.</p> <p>Various other coverage moves can be used in lieu of Shadow Claw or Stone Edge. Ice Beam takes out Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock, OHKOes the albeit rare Landorus-T, and can also 2HKO support Groudon. Overheat or Fire Blast can be used to blow Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor away, with Fire Blast also 2HKOing support Groudon thanks to Drought. Lastly, Shadow Force can be used to OHKO Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O as well as block Defog, but bear in mind it is easy for the opponent to switch in something that resists or is immune to Ghost during the charge turn, and Lugia is also given a free turn to Roost back to full health and reactivate Multiscale.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Arceus to at worst Speed tie with opposing Arceus and defeats Mega Gengar prior to Mega Evolving if it lacks Protect. Life Orb grants a significant power boost to all its attacks. Either Silk Scarf or Lum Berry can be used alongside an Adamant nature and a more bulky spread of 200 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe, which outspeeds Adamant Rayquaza. Investing heavily in HP makes Arceus a lot bulkier, allowing it to set up more easily, and a Lum Berry allows Arceus to absorb a Will-O-Wisp or a Dark Void.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't just use Arceus late-game, as it's an amazing revenge killer that can take out dangerous opposing threats when they are weakened. Do not set up whilst checks are still healthy, as you should be using teammates to wear them down to the point where Arceus can OHKO them and avoid taking damage or status. You should wear down Will-O-Wisp users as well. Similarly, do not set up on something like Primal Kyogre's Origin Pulse, as Arceus takes a huge amount of damage and can no longer sweep due to it being in range of opposing priority attacks, as well as being able to take fewer turns of Life Orb recoil. Setting up on things like Latios's -2 Draco Meteor is smarter, as it means Arceus doesn't get blasted on the turn it sets up.</p> <p>When revenge killing bulky opposing threats, it is necessary to deal significant damage to them as they set up so that Arceus can revenge kill them easily. Foes such as Primal Groudon, Xerneas, and Mega Salamence need to be significantly weakened in order for Extreme Speed to KO them after you sacrifice a Pokemon to bring Arceus in safely. For Pokemon like Darkrai, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Blaziken, only a slight amount of prior damage is needed to push them into Extreme Speed range, but it is wise to calculate whether they will fall to Extreme Speed or not before trying to revenge kill them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon absorbs burns for Arceus while setting up Stealth Rock and potentially weakening Lugia with either Lava Plume burns, Toxic, or Stone Edge. Darkrai or Yveltal can be double switched into Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Lugia, either KOing them or forcing them out and making them take more entry hazard damage the next time they come in. Shadow Ball Mega Gengar can trap checks such as Lugia and severely weaken Arceus-Ghost as well, and it can also run Hidden Power Fire for Ferrothorn or Mega Scizor. Xerneas can easily switch into defensive Yveltal, with Choice Scarf and Geomancy Xerneas both working very well on the kinds of teams Arceus finds itself on. Healing Wish Latias can be used to bring Arceus back for a second go at the opponent's team as well.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Extreme Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Arceus to set up, boosting its Attack by two stages and providing it with a threatening offensive presence and sweeping potential. After a Swords Dance boost, Arceus is able to OHKO many notable threats in the tier, such as offensive Yveltal, Mewtwo, Rayquaza, and most variants of Primal Groudon and Xerneas. Extreme Speed is a strong +2 priority STAB move, allowing it to bypass faster threats along with slower forms of priority; this gives Arceus solid revenge killing ability to allow it to dispatch frailer threats such as Darkrai and Deoxys-A. Shadow Claw, although relatively weak, is essential Ghost-type coverage to allow Arceus to deal damage to common Ghost-types that are immune to Extreme Speed, such as Giratina-O, Mega Gengar, and Arceus-Ghost. Bronzong and Jirachi also take a reasonable chunk of damage due to Shadow Claw also hitting them super effectively. Shadow Claw also damages common Steel-types such as Dialga and Klefki for at least neutral damage. Recover is a reliable form of recovery, increasing Arceus's longevity throughout games and giving it more opportunities to set up and increasing its sweeping potential. Due to its bulk and Recover, Arceus can shrug off unboosted neutral attacks, such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast, with relative ease and create an opportunity to set up Swords Dance. One can opt to forgo Recover for Earthquake to maximize Arceus's coverage, allowing it to get past Tyranitar, which would otherwise comfortably wall it, and OHKO Klefki and all common Primal Groudon variants after Stealth Rock damage. With Earthquake, Arceus can also somewhat reliably deal with Ferrothorn and the uncommon Mega Scizor, as Earthquake does a considerable amount of damage to them after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment coupled with Life Orb and an Adamant nature is used so Arceus is able to pick up OHKOs or dent walls as much as possible after a Swords Dance, making it much more feasible to sweep. 124 Speed EVs allow Arceus to outspeed fully invested positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, in addition to some support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to provide Arceus with some bulk to increase its ability to take unboosted hits and successfully utilize Recover. While Life Orb is the set's item of choice for maximum damage output, one may opt for a Silk Scarf instead due to the Life Orb recoil being a hindrance. However, the power drop is noticeable, mainly in Arceus's coverage moves; for example, Giratina-O now has to be worn down before it can be taken out by a boosted Shadow Claw, and Arceus also misses out on an OHKO against Primal Groudon with a +2 Earthquake. An alternative spread to consider is 240 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Spe to maximize Arceus's bulk; however, it would lose out on the ability to outspeed maximum Speed base 90 Speed Pokemon. Despite this, it retains the ability to outspeed neutral-natured fully invested ones such as Modest Dialga and Adamant Ho-Oh.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus is a proficient revenge killer that can pick off frail and weakened threats and should not be preserved completely for late-game. In most scenarios, Arceus is going to be revenge killing fast threats such as Deoxys-A, Darkrai, and Mewtwo with its strong STAB Extreme Speed along with taking out threatening sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas, Mega Salamence, and Primal Groudon, though these need to be worn down much more to be in the KO range of Extreme Speed. Arceus with Recover needs a more efficient game plan than Earthquake variants, so try to keep it healthy so that it can safely utilize Recover. Weak and moderately powerful moves that Arceus can use Recover against such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast make for good setup fodder. Avoid using Swords Dance in situations that would get Arceus crippled by status from moves such as Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Wave, limiting its offensive capabilities. Take caution against Pokemon that do a considerable amount of damage unboosted such as offensive Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence with Double-Edge, Rayquaza, and Ho-Oh with Brave Bird, as they can take a huge chunk of HP out of Arceus, limiting its longevity and putting it into KO range of opposing priority attacks. It's also recommended that certain Arceus checks such as Giratina-O, Lugia, defensive Yveltal, and Mega Sableye be weakened considerably before setting up Swords Dance to avoid being phazed or crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Defensive Yveltal especially deters Arceus from setting up, as it survives a +2 Life Orb Extreme Speed even after Stealth Rock and OHKOes it back with Foul Play. It is much safer for Arceus to set up on targets such as Mega Diancie, Dialga, and Latios after a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor, first using Recover and proceeding to boost with Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Xerneas possesses good offensive synergy with Arceus and is a direct answer to defensive Yveltal, one of the main checks to Extreme Killer Arceus, while being able to double switch into Giratina-O to keep up offensive momentum. Xerneas and Arceus also share similar checks, such as Klefki, and they can overwhelm their checks, which allows room for one of them to set up as a possible wincon or deal a considerable amount of damage. Choice Scarf or Rest Xerneas variants are also effective sleep absorbers against Darkrai, especially on offensive builds. Rock Polish Primal Groudon partners very well with Arceus due to its ability to remove fast threats and become a solid wincon, late-game cleaner, and Xerneas answer for offensive teams. Primal Groudon is also an effective Stealth Rock user that is able to deal with Steel-types such as Klefki, being useful on mainly balanced and bulky offensive builds. Dialga with a Shuca Berry is another Stealth Rock setter to consider, especially on hyper offensive builds due to its ability to get past Magic Bounce users and pressure common Defoggers. It also allows Primal Groudon to run a move in place of Stealth Rock and is a reactive but defined answer to Mega Salamence, preventing a potential sweep. Mega Salamence is an effective wallbreaker able to dent defensive Yveltal and put bulkier threats into Extreme Speed's KO range, and it is a reliable Ground-immune Pokemon that is able to deal with Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh with Facade, being unbothered by Sacred Fire burns. On the other hand, Mega Salamence appreciates Arceus's ability to deal with faster threats such as Darkrai, Deoxys-A, and Mewtwo. Mega Gengar is another solid Mega Evolution to consider due to its good offensive synergy with Arceus, trapping and removing particular common answers to Arceus such as Lugia, Ferrothorn, Bronzong, and other Arceus formes such as Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Dragon. Mega Gengar can also force trades with Destiny Bond in certain situations against Ho-Oh, opposing Swords Dance Arceus like Extreme Killer, Arceus-Ghost, and Arceus-Ground, and other priority users such as Mega Kangaskhan. Threats to Mega Gengar like Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, and offensive Yveltal can be dealt with by Arceus in return. Dark-types such as Yveltal and Darkrai are able to pressure opposing Ghost-types such as Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost while dealing with other common Arceus answers such as Lugia and Mega Sableye. Yveltal in particular can utilize aggressive play effectively; try to bring Yveltal in on Giratina-O on a predicted switch into Arceus to fire off a Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse or Choice Band-boosted Knock Off. In return, Arceus is able to deal with Mega Diancie and unboosted Geomancy or Choice Scarf Xerneas that would threaten Darkrai and Yveltal or even revenge kill them with Extreme Speed. Ho-Oh is another effective wallbreaker and has Sacred Fire to spread burns while being able to take on common Steel-types, such as Klefki, Bronzong, and Ferrothorn, that would otherwise be a hindrance to Arceus. Furthermore, Ho-Oh is a somewhat reliable sleep absorber and is also able to take on Xerneas, which can beat Arceus one-on-one in some scenarios, as a healthy Geomancy Xerneas can actually set up on an unboosted Arceus.</p>"

  "Arceus-Bug": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Bug's typing offers no useful resistances, as any users of Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves have either secondary STAB or coverage moves that will destroy Arceus-Bug. The Stealth Rock weakness further weakens Arceus-Bug's longevity, removing 25% of its HP on every switch in. Bug isn't the worst offensive typing in Ubers, as there are many Psychic- and Dark-types in the tier. Unfortunately, Arceus-Bug is easily checked by many things in Ubers, as anything that is somewhat bulky can withstand its attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Bug's options are very limited. A Calm Mind set is a possibility, but Ho-Oh poses such a great threat to such a set that it is generally not worthwhile. Extreme Speed is a possible coverage move that allows Arceus-Bug to get past faster threats and beat a boosted Darkrai if weakened. Non-STAB Extreme Speed is extremely weak, however, even with a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon is able to switch into Arceus-Bug easily and threaten to set up boosting moves, set up Stealth Rock, and OHKO Arceus-Bug. Not even a +2 Earthquake can OHKO Primal Groudon, and therefore the matchup should be completely avoided until Primal Groudon is sufficiently worn down.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Salamence can switch into Arceus-Bug and get a free turn to Mega Evolve thanks to Intimidate, then threaten to OHKO with its STAB move. If Salamence has already Mega Evolved when it switches in, Stone Edge can 2HKO non-bulky sets, but even with this, the best possible scenario is that Mega Salamence Speed ties with Arceus-Bug and can potentially OHKO with Return or Double-Edge. The risk can be high for both sides, but mostly favors the Mega Salamence user.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ghost</strong>: Arceus-Ghost resists Bug and takes pitiful damage from Arceus-Bug's coverage moves, making it a good switch-in. Arceus-Ghost can then threaten to countersweep with Calm Mind or Swords Dance, or it can burn Arceus-Bug with Will-O-Wisp if using a defensive set.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O resists X-Scissor and is immune to Earthquake, leaving Stone Edge as Arceus-Bug's only way to hurt it. Unfortunately, Giratina-O is bulky enough to avoid a 2HKO from even a +2 Stone Edge and can phaze with Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types that are neutral to Earthquake such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Mega Scizor are excellent checks to Arceus-Bug.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Arceus-Bug is actually very weak in comparison to other threats. Many Pokemon in Ubers can handle its attacks and check it as a result. can also be used earlier in the match to revenge kill Calm Mind Latios or Latias if necessary. Arceus-Bug's resistance to Ground- and Fighting-type moves can give it a way to switch in, but be very careful; most users of such moves typically have other coverage moves that can deal heavy damage to Arceus-Bug. Arceus-Bug can check Mega Lucario easily. However, Mega Lucario is rather rare.</p> <h3>Team Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Bug requires a huge amount of support to be even slightly effective. Defog users such as Latios, Latias, Mega Scizor, and Giratina-O can clear all entry hazards, all of which are very detrimental to Arceus-Bug's longevity. Giratina-O also doubles as a check to Primal Groudon, a Pokemon that can counter Arceus-Bug with ease, making it an effective partner. Other checks to Primal Groudon include Latios, Latias, Shuca Berry Dialga, and defensive Mega Salamence. Checks to Mega Salamence such as Dialga, Klefki, Tyranitar, and Mega Aerodactyl are appreciated, as Arceus-Bug cannot beat it one-on-one without a Swords Dance boost. It should be noted that Arceus-Bug has a hard time revenge killing Mewtwo and Nasty Plot Darkrai, so checks to them might be a good idea. Checks to Mewtwo include Latios, Latias, Yveltal, and Giratina-O, while checks to Darkrai include Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Tyranitar.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is the preferred set over Calm Mind, as the existence of Ho-Oh leaves Calm Mind an unviable alternative. X-Scissor is the most powerful physical STAB move Arceus-Bug can use and is effective against the numerous Psychic- and Dark-types in the tier, as it is able to OHKO Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, Darkrai, and the offensive Deoxys formes. Earthquake is used as coverage, allowing Arceus-Bug to hit Primal Groudon, Mega Diancie, and most Steel-types. It should be noted that Earthquake is very weak without a boost from Swords Dance, and even then, Pokemon such as Primal Groudon can survive a +2 Earthquake. Stone Edge is used to hit Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Ho-Oh. Iron Head can be used over Earthquake if you wish to hit Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy, which can otherwise check Arceus-Bug easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximize Attack EVs to give Arceus-Bug as much power as possible. Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Arceus-Bug to outspeed anything under base 120 Speed and Speed tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Bug is best used as a late-game cleaner, once Primal Groudon and other checks are sufficiently weakened.

  "Arceus-Dark": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Dark has received a few indirect buffs in the ORAS metagame due to the reintroduction of the Soul Dew for Latias and Latios, an increase in Giratina-O's usage, and the addition of Primal Groudon, a Pokemon that can punish Fairy-type Pokemon, which are the most common checks to Arceus-Dark. However, it does dislike the slight decline of stall in the more offensively-oriented metagame. Like all Arceus formes, Arceus-Dark has access to exceptional 120 / 120 / 120 bulk, which grants it many setup opportunities. Thanks to its typing, it serves as a solid offensive check to many Psychic- and Ghost-type threats in the metagame, such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Latias, Latios, Arceus-Ghost, and Giratina-O. Dark is also a great offensive typing, especially because there is no type immune to it. This allows an effective mono-attacking set to be run, freeing up a slot for Refresh, which allows it to shrug off status and become a menacing stallbreaker. Unfortunately, it still struggles against Fairy-types, which are very common in Ubers, as well as against Fighting-types, though they have been in decline since the introduction of the Fairy-type. Additionally, Dark as a defensive type does not have many useful resistances, so Arceus-Dark faces intense competition from other Arceus formes that run viable support sets. In spite of this, Arceus-Dark is one of the best Calm Mind Arceus formes that can be a fierce stallbreaker and late-game sweeper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Dark can plausibly run a support set that utilizes its wide range of support moves. It can use Defog against many of the threats that the Calm Mind variant can set up on and check Psychic- and Ghost-types as well as Yveltal to some extent. It should be noted that a support set of Arceus-Dark is not susceptible to Shadow Tag, which gives it a distinct niche over other support Arceus formes; however, it lacks many useful resistances. Sludge Bomb can help Arceus-Dark bypass some of the Fairy-type Pokemon that threaten it. Lastly, Substitute is an useful move that can be used over Refresh, as it blocks status, including Leech Seed, and can aid in setup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are the most prevalent and dangerous checks to Arceus-Dark in the metagame. Geomancy Xerneas easily sets up on Arceus-Dark, while Choice Scarf Xerneas can switch in on any move except for Sludge Bomb and begin to spam Moonblast. Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy and Calm Mind Xerneas can also set up on Arceus-Dark. Klefki can use Thunder Wave and 3HKO Arceus-Dark with Play Rough if it gets lucky or use Arceus-Dark as Spikes fodder, although it is prone to being worn down with repeated hits. Bulky Fairies such as Arceus-Fairy and Clefable do fairly well against Arceus-Dark; however, it should be noted that both Pokemon are weak to Sludge Bomb. Clefable is especially notable because its ability Unaware allows it to ignore Arceus-Dark's Calm Mind boosts. Mega Mawile resists Judgment and can do at least 72% to Arceus-Dark with an uninvested Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Though they may be less common, Fighting-types are still strong checks that can beat Arceus-Dark. Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken after a Speed boost both outspeed and have a chance to OHKO Arceus-Dark with Low Kick. Lucario can tank a Judgment, or outspeed 176 Speed Arceus-Dark if it has already Mega Evolved, and OHKO with Close Combat. Arceus-Fighting can also beat Arceus-Dark by virtue of its typing.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar is an effective check to Arceus-Dark, as it resists Judgment, has an impressive Special Defense stat that is further boosted by Sandstorm, and can retaliate with Low Kick, which does 40%-47% to Arceus-Dark uninvested, not counting residual damage from the sand. Low Kick also has twice as much PP as Arceus-Dark's Recover, so Tyranitar will easily stall out Arceus-Dark. Tyranitar can also phaze it with Roar.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Fast physical attackers, especially ones that have high Attack stats or access to super effective coverage moves, can revenge kill or severely dent Arceus-Dark, capitalizing on its unboosted Defense stat. Genesect is a good check to Arceus-Dark despite the fact that it takes significant damage if it switches into Judgment. With a Download-boosted STAB U-turn, Genesect can effectively revenge kill Arceus-Dark, dealing 58%-69%. Zekrom can also do around 50% with Bolt Strike. Life Orb Deoxys-A can hit it with a super effective Low Kick or Superpower for 67%-80%, while Mega Salamence does 51% minimum with Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with exceptional special bulk can act as soft checks to Arceus-Dark. Primal Kyogre with investment in bulk can tank Arceus-Dark's Judgments and, while it doesn't do much damage back, can phaze Arceus-Dark. Ho-Oh can tank hits, hit moderately hard with Brave Bird, fish for burns with Sacred Fire, or phaze with Whirlwind, but it is not a particularly reliable check without Whirlwind.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Arceus-Dark to set up against Pokemon it threatens, such as Latias, Latios, Arceus-Ghost, and Giratina-O, and proceed to break through stall or initiate a late-game sweep. Judgment is Arceus-Dark's primary and only attack, having great neutral coverage for a STAB move while reliably hitting pretty hard after a Calm Mind boost or two. Recover allows it to stay around longer and set up on support Pokemon or weaker offensive threats. Refresh is useful to remove annoying status such as poison, paralysis, or burns, improving Arceus-Dark's impressive stallbreaking capacity. Will-O-Wisp is another option you could use over Refresh if you prefer your Arceus-Dark to check physical threats instead of being a frightening stallbreaker, but Refresh tends to be more useful if a team is adequately prepared for said physical threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment maximizes Arceus-Dark's mixed bulk, which allows it to set up more easily. Running 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows it to outspeed positive-natured base 110 Speed Pokemon, such as Latias, Latios, and non-Mega Gengar, and KO them with Judgment before they can attack; Gengar in particular threatens Arceus-Dark with Destiny Bond. Other viable Speed investment options include 96 Speed EVs with a Timid nature for outspeeding base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Palkia, non-Mega Salamence, and Kangaskhan, while 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows Arceus-Dark to Speed tie with at worst other Arceus formes. The remaining EVs go into physical bulk because Ubers is mostly dominated by numerous physical threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Arceus-Dark's typing and bulk to switch in on some special attackers such as Palkia and neutral support Arceus, as well as Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon that Arceus-Dark can set up on. When doing so, be wary of Mega Mewtwo X and Focus Blast Mega Mewtwo Y; Mega Mewtwo Y's Focus Blast can deal as much as 81% to Arceus-Dark, while Mega Mewtwo X has a solid chance to OHKO it with Low Kick. It is often crucial to scout opposing Mewtwo before switching in, lest you lose a valuable win condition for your team. If Arceus-Dark is not needed to check members of the opposing team, it can be effective to reveal it late-game and sweep when the opposing team has been weakened or lacks checks to Arceus-Dark.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Reliable switch-ins to Fairy-types, such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, are indispensable partners for Arceus-Dark, as Arceus-Dark tends to give them free switches and is often threatened out by them. Mega Gengar can remove Fairy-types altogether by virtue of Shadow Tag and its typing. Klefki, Scizor, and other Steel-types check Geomancy Xerneas, which is useful if other checks to Fairy-types cannot reliably check this Xerneas variant. Latias and Latios appreciate Pokemon that threaten them such as Arceus-Ghost checked by Arceus-Dark, while they check Fighting-types for it and provide Defog support. Lugia checks Fighting-types and physical attackers in general, which can often revenge kill or do considerable damage to Arceus-Dark. Finally, bulky Fairy-types of your own, especially Xerneas, can check Mega Mewtwo X for Arceus-Dark.</p>"
      },
      "Perish Trap": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Perish Song limits your foe to only three turns of play, which coupled with Whirlpool prevents the opponent from switching out. Judgment is Arceus-Dark's main attack and is very useful to get off chip damage or even knock out the foe at low HP. Judgment also hits a lot of common Pokemon super effectively, such as Lugia, Giratina-O, and Arceus-Ghost, and it also hits the Ghost-types that cannot be trapped by Whirlpool. Recover is used to help Arceus-Dark survive longer when a foe is trapped.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed EVs help Arceus-Dark outspeed maximum Speed base 110s like Mega Diancie, Latios, and Latias. 248 HP EVs are used to maximize Arceus-Dark's bulk and to also minimize entry hazard damage. The remaining EVs are poured into Defense, since most of the Pokemon that are pressuring Arceus-Dark will be physical attackers. Maximum Speed investment is another option that Arceus-Dark can use so that it will outspeed or, at worst, Speed tie with Arceus-Ghost, preventing it from being KOed by a Brick Break or Focus Blast if it wins the tie and has not been weakened much.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Dark should be used against bulkier Pokemon that cannot do much damage to it, such as Ferrothorn, Klefki, Arceus-Water and other Arceus formes, and Blissey, so that it is able to stall them out successfully. However, some bulky Pokemon such as Ho-Oh can deal a lot of damage to Arceus-Dark, preventing it from successfully trapping and KOing them. Since Arceus-Dark will usually only be in play for about four turns at a time, and most of those turns will be it using Recover, Arceus-Dark does not really care about being burned, but really fears Toxic due to the great increase in damage taken every turn. Arceus-Dark's great typing means it should be switched in on very prominent threats in the metagame, such as Giratina-O, Lugia, and Arceus-Ghost. Some setup Pokemon can be very scary and sometimes it might be worth it to get off a sacrificial Perish Song to threaten these Pokemon out. Be wary of Primal Groudon when it switches in, as it is unaffected by Whirlpool and as such cannot be trapped and will get a free turn. Arceus-Dark also lures in Klefki and deals with it well, which means that balanced teams can get broken down quite easily by Arceus-Dark; however, Klefki will usually be able to significantly damage Arceus-Dark in the process. When using this set, keep in mind that once Arceus-Dark traps a Pokemon with Whirlpool, it does not have to stay in, as switching out can also be a good option after trapping a Pokemon, since you can switch to a check while the opponent's only option is to stay in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is known for being able to pair well with almost any Pokemon, and Arceus-Dark is no exception. Arceus-Dark really appreciates Primal Groudon's ability to take on Xerneas, as well as having a switch-in to Klefki to avoid Thunder Wave and Toxic while limiting the layers of Spikes it can set up. Since Arceus-Dark is a stallbreaker and is overwhelmed by offense, combinations of partners that can deal with offense are helpful. Giratina-O can switch in, avoid the 2HKO from Primal Groudon, and will be able to help out a lot by threatening Primal Groudon out, since Whirlpool cannot hit it through harsh sunlight. Klefki is also a nice partner, as it is able to paralyze and cripple opposing threats, as well as set up Spikes. Not only that, but Klefki is also helpful to have for the ever-common Fairies that give Arceus-Dark so much trouble. Dialga is able to take on the very threatening Mega Salamence as well as set up Stealth Rock. Although Arceus-Dark is able to deal with Pokemon such as Deoxys-A and Mewtwo, it is a good idea to have a secondary answer to these Pokemon, since their Speed allows them to come in and revenge kill Arceus-Dark when it is not at full HP. Xerneas really appreciates this set, since it is heavily walled by Blissey and Klefki, two Pokemon that Arceus-Dark deals with quite easily, and it can really get to work after they are taken care of.</p>"

  "Arceus-Dragon": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Dragon has a niche as an Arceus forme that compresses a Fire-type resistance and the ability to check Mega Salamence into one Pokemon. Though Arceus-Water can boast the same utility, Arceus-Dragon’s STAB type differs and allows it to hit Mega Salamence, Primal Groudon, and Mega Gengar and break Ho-Oh's Substitutes with only a single moveslot, whereas Arceus-Water would require two moveslots; this means that it is easy to justify as a Defogger on teams that need its qualities. The primary reason Arceus-Dragon is not preferred over Arceus-Water is because it can compound weaknesses to common Ice- and Fairy-type attacks; however, the role compression its Dragon typing offers lets it serve as a Defogger on balanced and bulky offensive teams that can be difficult to exploit. Dragon as an offensive typing is also not great, with Fairy- and Steel-types being common and effective checks. As a defensive typing, Dragon is a mixed bag; while super effective Judgment can keep opposing Dragon-types at bay, they can KO Arceus-Dragon in return, and Dragon Tail Primal Groudon can be an annoyance. It also trades a resistance to Ice for a resistance to Electric when compared to Arceus-Water, making its synergy with Primal Groudon a little less noticeable. Although defensive Arceus-Dragon is a great check to support Primal Groudon, it must be paired with something that can check offensive Primal Groudon, and it has poor type synergy with traditional checks to offensive Primal Groudon such as Latias, Giratina-O, and Mega Salamence, which can somewhat restrict teambuilding. Arceus-Dragon is also hampered by being affected by all types of entry hazards and by all non-volatile status conditions, reducing its ability to bring much defensive synergy to a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge can be used on the support set to KO Ho-Oh, but crippling it with Toxic is usually enough to suppress it. Iron Head and Poison Jab are options instead of Iron Tail on the Swords Dance set due to their higher accuracy and secondary effects, but the drop in power is significant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Diancie and Klefki</strong>: Mega Diancie is immune to Arceus-Dragon's STAB attack and bounces back status moves, while Klefki is immune to Toxic and can cripple Arceus-Dragon with Toxic of its own.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, Clefable, and Mega Mawile are immune to Arceus-Dragon's STAB attack and can retaliate with STAB-boosted super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist Arceus-Dragon's STAB attack and are immune to Toxic, although they dislike Will-O-Wisp and fear Fire Blast from Calm Mind Arceus-Dragon and Earthquake from Swords Dance variants. Common Steel-types include Dialga, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Genesect, Jirachi, Aegislash, and Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey takes pitiful damage from Arceus-Dragon’s neutral Judgment and can use Heal Bell to cure all status ailments inflicted by Arceus-Dragon while being able to cripple it with Toxic. It is defeated by Swords Dance variants, however.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia can switch into both of Arceus-Dragon's offensive sets and proceed to poison it with Toxic or phaze it with Whirlwind. Lugia dislikes Toxic from the support set, however.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh has the special bulk to comfortably switch into Calm Mind Arceus-Dragon and hit back with a powerful Brave Bird or aim for a burn with Sacred Fire. Standard Ho-Oh cannot afford to come into Arceus-Dragon's Outrage and can be Toxic stalled by support Arceus-Dragon, however.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Zekrom and Kyurem-W</strong>: Both Choice Scarf Zekrom and Kyurem-W are able to revenge kill each of Arceus-Dragon's sets. However, they cannot switch directly into Arceus-Dragon in fear of its Dragon-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Fast Attackers</strong>: Fast attackers such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, and Deoxys-A can effectively check Arceus-Dragon due to their superior Speed stats and power. Mewtwo can set up Calm Mind or use Taunt against Arceus-Dragon to stop it from Defogging; Darkrai is able to put it to sleep with Dark Void and proceed to boost with Nasty Plot; and Deoxys-A can obliterate it with Psycho Boost or a super effective Ice Beam. Each of these Pokemon including all of the Mewtwo formes are fast and powerful enough to revenge kill Arceus-Dragon, though they cannot comfortably switch into any of its attacks and dislike Toxic from support Arceus-Dragon.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Arceus-Dragon cannot Defog safely on Cloyster due to the threat of Icicle Spear; however, Cloyster cannot switch into Judgment and loses if its Focus Sash is not intact.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ice</strong>: Arceus-Ice can defeat Arceus-Dragon one-on-one due to its typing advantage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Judgment is an all-purpose STAB attack that notably breaks Ho-Oh's Substitutes and can KO Mega Salamence. Toxic weakens the staying power of opposing support Arceus, Calm Mind Arceus, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon. Although the latter is hit rather hard by Judgment, Arceus-Dragon will have a much easier time Recover stalling Primal Groudon if it has been badly poisoned; it can also annoy certain Fairy-type switch-ins such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy. Will-O-Wisp can be run to ease the matchup against Steel-types such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Jirachi, which Arceus-Dragon would otherwise do nothing to, and lets Arceus-Dragon function as a physical check to Swords Dance Arceus for its team. It can be afforded as long as Ho-Oh is checked well by Arceus-Dragon’s teammates and that Toxic lures for Primal Groudon are used alongside it. Recover is a staple on any bulky Arceus forme, letting Arceus-Dragon heal itself intermittently throughout the match to check threats such as Mega Salamence and Primal Groudon when needed to. Defog gives Arceus-Dragon utility in clearing entry hazards, especially considering that it has an overall good matchup against the most common Stealth Rock user, Primal Groudon, and Judgment's neutral coverage allows for the use of it with very few repercussions.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Draco Plate lets Arceus become Arceus-Dragon and makes Judgment a Dragon-type attack that gives it the ability to compress a way of hitting both Mega Salamence and Primal Groudon. 252 HP EVs maximize bulk and 56 Speed EVs allow Arceus-Dragon to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza. The rest of the EVs are invested into Defense with a Bold Nature in order to let Arceus-Dragon check Mega Salamence and Primal Groudon. The investments into HP and Defense hit impressive benchmarks, as they make it so that Arceus-Dragon has only a 12.5% chance to be 2HKOed by Adamant Mega Salamence's Return after Stealth Rock damage, survives +1 Adamant Mega Salamence's Double Edge after Stealth Rock damage, and is not 2HKOed by Primal Groudon's fully invested Precipice Blades.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Before the match, formulate a plan during Team Preview in which you make priority of what you will need to check with Arceus-Dragon, as it can be easily overloaded between checking Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Ho-Oh. Switch Arceus-Dragon into Pokemon that it can check, such as Primal Groudon, and spread status. Monitor health closely to let Arceus-Dragon sponge hits, use Recover often, and avoid status moves, especially against a team with a Mega Diancie or Mega Sableye on it. Additionally, avoid giving free turns to Fairy-types at all costs, as Pokemon such as Klefki and Xerneas can set Spikes or set up on Arceus-Dragon. Use Arceus-Dragon as bait to these Pokemon and aggressively double switch your Fairy-type punishes or checks to buy free turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks and punishers to Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Klefki are appreciated, making Ho-Oh, Mega Gengar, Klefki, and Excadrill good teammates. Mega Diancie checks are the most dire of teammates to Arceus-Dragon, as it can endlessly find free turns on Arceus-Dragon to set up Stealth Rock, use Heal Bell, or boost with Calm Mind. Specially defensive Primal Groudon, Aegislash, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn all make for good switch-ins to it; Mega Diancie lures such as Flash Cannon Klefki can be useful as well. Specially defensive Primal Kyogre with Roar deserves a special mention as a teammate to Arceus-Dragon, as it can switch into virtually any special attack that is super effective against Arceus-Dragon, check Magic Bounce users such as Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, and phaze a boosted Geomancy Xerneas. Arceus-Dragon is able to check support Primal Groudon, but it struggles against offensive Primal Groudon that carry boosting moves such as Rock Polish and or Swords Dance. Lugia, defensive Yveltal, Skarmory, and Landorus-T are all able to check at least one or at most two variants of offensive Primal Groudon; however, if your team can afford having multiple Dragon-types, Mega Salamence, Latias, Latios, Giratina-O, and Charti Berry Rayquaza are options as well. Arceus-Dragon carrying Will-O-Wisp needs teammates that can lure in Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh to hit them with Toxic, such as Aegislash and Klefki. As for teammates that benefit from Arceus-Dragon running Will-O-Wisp, Gothitelle stands out because of how it appreciates Arceus-Dragon's ability to bait and cripple Steel-types, letting Gothitelle run a different support move aside from Tickle that synergizes better with Arceus-Dragon, such as Thunder Wave, which can trap Defog Latias and Latios and other Dragon-types that threaten Arceus-Dragon, such as Dialga and Palkia.</p> <p>When teambuilding with Arceus-Dragon, try to lean your team more towards bulky offense when choosing between it and Arceus-Water. Arceus-Water tends to fit more naturally on stall teams because they can make up for the compromises that it has to make with move choices. Arceus-Dragon's Judgment compresses moveslots which makes for builds that are more proactive than anything that opts for Arceus-Water.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This offensive set makes use of Swords Dance, possibly allowing Arceus-Dragon to clean late in a match and surprising its usual checks and counters with more coverage moves and hitting with physical attacks rather than special ones. Outrage is the strongest physical STAB attack available to Arceus-Dragon; while it is powerful and accurate, its locking effect means that it should not be used until enemy Fairy-types have been eliminated. Earthquake is used for the Steel-types that resist Outrage, although it also hits other targets such as Primal Groudon. Iron Tail gives Arceus-Dragon a method of hitting Fairy-types hard, being able to deal upwards of 75% to the bulkiest Fairy-types around when at +2. Extreme Speed is an option instead of Iron Tail that gives some utility in priority and a method of blowing past weakened revenge killers. Overheat and Fire Blast are options that can hit some defensive threats such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Draco Plate is the necessary held item to transform into Arceus-Dragon and slightly boosts the power of Outrage. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are used to maximize Arceus-Dragon's Speed, allowing it to beat relevant base 110 Speed threats and Speed tie with other maximum Speed Arceus formes. 252 Attack EVs are necessary to fully raise Arceus-Dragon's damage output. The remaining 4 EVs are placed into Defense to ensure that Genesect gets a Special Attack boost from Download.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Arceus-Dragon should be treated as a late-game cleaner to capitalize on both the use of Outrage and its unexpected nature. +2 Iron Tail is very strong and can be used as an intermediate wallbreaking method to clear away defensive Fairy-types in the middle of a match. Arceus-Dragon can then clean at a later time when other threats have been eliminated or damaged enough for it to break through; note that using Arceus-Dragon to immediately wallbreak has the cost of revealing the set. Iron Tail is strong enough to deal massive damage to even defensive Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy, but not enough to OHKO them from full health. Don't underestimate Outrage's power; it hits significantly harder than Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed and is able to OHKO defensive Yveltal and 248 HP Arceus after Stealth Rock when at +2. Entry hazards often make the difference for ensuring OHKOs with Arceus-Dragon, as they help to whittle down the foe into KO range. For these reasons, maintaining an entry hazard advantage can justify aggressive play from other teammates in order to help ensure that Arceus-Dragon can clean later on. Stay away from burns and paralysis; the former cripples Arceus-Dragon to the point where it will struggle to clean, and the latter gives up Arceus-Dragon's Speed advantage, making it significantly easier to revenge kill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon offensively checks just about every Pokemon that Arceus-Dragon can't break past. Primal Groudon also offers a switch-in for Fairy-type moves on an offensive team and can set Stealth Rock. Mega Gengar can trap and eliminate defensive Fairy-types and Arceus formes, which are common threats that can prevent an Arceus-Dragon sweep. Suicide or offensive entry hazard setters help Arceus-Dragon secure a variety of KOs and fit well on an offensive team; Deoxys-S, Dialga, Forretress, Greninja, and Mega Aerodactyl are some examples. An offensive Xerneas check is mandatory to provide a switch-in to Fairy-type attacks and to prevent a Geomancy sweep. Ho-Oh is a good partner due to its ability to offensively check Fairy- and Steel-types, but do not use it if using a suicide hazard lead, as using Ho-Oh mandates entry hazard removal. Ho-Oh alone can justify a bulky offensive build, in which a longer-lasting Spikes setter such as Klefki is recommended.</p>"

  "Arceus-Electric": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Electric is not very effective in the current metagame as a support Arceus forme. The biggest reason for this is the presence of Primal Groudon, which is immune to Arceus-Electric's STAB attacks and takes very little damage from its weak Ice Beams. Primal Groudon's commonness means that most teams will carry at least one counter to Arceus-Electric, and there are several other common answers to it in the Ubers metagame as well, such as Latias and Arceus-Ground. Arceus-Electric does have three resistances to make use of, but only the resistance to Flying-type moves is particularly useful. Moreover, Arceus-Electric takes heavy damage from Earthquake coverage, which all offensive Flying-types in Ubers commonly run. Compounding its issues is its lack of offensive presence, as Arceus-Electric is forced to use Toxic to do anything to Ground-types and must use Will-O-Wisp to hit Ferrothorn. Fortunately, Arceus-Electric does have a couple of redeeming qualities that make it borderline usable. First of all, it only has one weakness, albeit a nasty one to Ground-type moves. Additionally, Arceus-Electric still has the amazing all-around stats that all Arceus formes have, granting it a nice mix of Speed and bulk. Finally, it is one of the only Pokemon capable of soft checking both Primal Kyogre and Flying-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Arceus-Electric has little flexibility in its given moveset, or else it will be open to a myriad of threats. Although Defog might seem like an appealing option at first, Arceus-Electric is a terrible user of the move because it loses badly to entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Toxic Ferrothorn. Ice Beam is an option to dent Latias and Latios, as well as to hit Mega Salamence and Rayquaza really hard, but Arceus-Electric struggles to find a moveslot for it. Besides, it can already cripple Rayquaza and Mega Salamence with Will-O-Wisp and Latias and Latios with Toxic. Thunder is an option over Judgment if you want a move that can paralyze the foe, but its low accuracy is unappealing on a Pokemon that needs to be as consistent as possible to support its team.</p> <p>Refresh is an option to allow Arceus-Electric to take on Toxic users, but it has little other utility. Fire Blast can be used to hit Ferrothorn really hard and has the added benefit of garnering a stronger hit on Klefki, allowing teammates such as Latios to take advantage of their checks being severely weakened. However, it has mediocre coverage with Arceus-Electric’s Judgment and forces it to give up a status move. Finally, Arceus-Electric can attempt to run a Calm Mind set with Judgment, Earth Power, Calm Mind, and Recover. Unfortunately, a Calm Mind set is difficult to pull off in this metagame due to Arceus-Electric's terrible offensive typing and susceptibility to Primal Groudon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon is immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Judgment and beats Arceus-Electric with its Ground-type STAB attacks. However, it should be wary of switching in on Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: Swords Dance variants of Arceus-Ground outrun and severely damage Arceus-Electric with Earthquake, and other variants hit it with Judgment. Nonetheless, they should be on the lookout for Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Latias and Latios</strong>: Although they dislike Toxic, Calm Mind Latias and Latios can otherwise set up on Arceus-Electric and proceed to threaten its team.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey doesn't care about anything Arceus-Electric can do and can use it to pass Wishes or use Aromatherapy. Ferrothorn can set up Spikes on Arceus-Electric, but it despises Will-O-Wisp. Heal Bell Clefable can also switch in comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Grass</strong>: Arceus-Grass will win one-on-one courtesy of its typing, but it despises Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Perish Song sets can remove Arceus-Electric fairly easily once it has Mega Evolved, as Mega Gengar can use Disable to stop Arceus from using Judgment and stall it out from there.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dual Status": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Judgment is Arceus-Electric's main STAB move and hits most Pokemon that don't carry an immunity or resistance to it fairly hard thanks to its high Base Power and the 1.2x boost granted by Zap Plate. Recover is mandatory to keep Arceus-Electric in good health throughout the match. The last two moveslots are both dedicated to status moves, which are crucial to Arceus-Electric's functionality in the tier. Will-O-Wisp allows Arceus-Electric to effectively check physical threats such as Mega Salamence, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Rayquaza one-on-one, and overeager Swords Dance Arceus-Ground on the switch. Will-O-Wisp can also burn walls such as Ferrothorn, which Arceus-Electric has no other way of dealing with, and prevents a +1 Mega Salamence from comfortably Roosting on its Judgment. Likewise, Toxic allows Arceus-Electric to cripple Calm Mind Arceus formes and gives Arceus-Electric a move to hit Primal Groudon switch-ins with. Earth Power is another option that Arceus-Electric can run in the fourth slot, as it garners a super effective hit on Primal Groudon, but its utility ends there.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Arceus-Electric to outrun Timid Latias and Latios while enhancing its physical bulk as much as possible. However, should you want even more physical bulk, an alternative spread of 248 HP / 204 Def / 56 Speed with a Timid nature is viable. This spread allows Arceus-Electric to outrun Jolly Rayquaza and avoid the OHKO from +1 Adamant Rayquaza's Earthquake. Note that with the given spread, Arceus-Electric is not a good Primal Kyogre check, as Origin Pulse easily 2HKOes Arceus-Electric and will OHKO it after a Calm Mind boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Liberally use status moves early on in the game, as afflicting a support Arceus forme or Primal Groudon with status will prove much more useful than spamming Judgment. Using status moves early in the game is an especially good idea because Ground-types are very common and often directly switch into Arceus-Electric; it prevents the foes from getting free switches by afflicting them with status. Although ideally you want to keep Arceus-Electric healthy throughout the match, it's only especially vital when the opponent has a Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, or another Pokemon it needs to check. In matches where Arceus-Electric is more or less dead weight, playing aggressively is the best course of action to accomplish as much as possible.</p> <p>Although Arceus-Electric is immune to Thunder Wave, it is a terrible absorber of the move. The reason for this is because almost every Thunder Wave user in the tier, such as Primal Groudon or Klefki, can defeat Arceus-Electric one-on-one. Arceus-Electric should also avoid Toxic at all costs, as the ailment will severely impair it when attempting to check the physical attackers it needs to check. If you have a cleric, make sure you remove Toxic later in the match if you allow Arceus-Electric to be afflicted by it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Arceus-Electric mandates the use of a Pokemon immune to Ground on your team due to its weakness to Arceus-Ground and Primal Groudon. Life Orb Shaymin-S is a good option, as it threatens to OHKO Arceus-Ground and can pass a Healing Wish to Arceus-Electric should it become crippled by Toxic. In return, Arceus-Electric can check Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence for it. Anti-entry hazard support is also appreciated because Arceus-Electric can easily have layers of Spikes set up on it by common Spikes setters such as Ferrothorn and Klefki. Mega Sableye can beat both of them while bouncing back any attempts to cripple Arceus-Electric with Toxic. Latios and Latias can remove hazards while checking Primal Groudon for Arceus-Electric. Defensive Mega Salamence is also a good entry hazard controller thanks to its access to Defog, although the two share a weakness to Ice Beam variants of Arceus-Ground. A cleric is also a good idea to use with Arceus-Electric, although it isn't mandatory. Defensive Xerneas and Blissey can both use Heal Bell should Arceus-Electric get poisoned or burned, while Arceus-Electric can check Pokemon that threaten them, such as Ho-Oh and Extreme Killer Arceus, in return.</p>"

  "Arceus-Fairy": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Fairy has the benefits of a good defensive typing and a solid offensive typing, as well as fantastic stats and an expansive movepool due to being an Arceus forme. This allows it to check big offensive threats such as Mega Salamence, Darkrai, Giratina-O, Latios, Rayquaza, and Yveltal. Arceus-Fairy also has the ability to beat a variety of Defoggers and Magic Bounce users, allowing it to either set Stealth Rock or pressure opposing anti-entry hazard techniques. Unfortunately, Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh resist Arceus-Fairy's STAB move, Judgment, and it is somewhat weak to Mega Gengar. Its lack of status or entry hazard immunities also limits the extents of its defensive synergy. Arceus-Fairy also suffers from creating redundancies with certain other Fairy-types if put on the same team as them; Pokemon such as Klefki and Mega Diancie make Arceus-Fairy less appealing to use because they offer unique utility and are in competition with it for a teamslot. Arceus-Fairy also suffers from the fact that a team's Arceus slot is usually better spent on a more effective typing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind + Iron Defense set can be used as a potential wincon but suffers from being much more passive against Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh as compared to the Recover + 3 attacks set. An offensive Calm Mind set is also an option, but it performs even worse against Ho-Oh and isn't particularly threatening.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Defensive Steel-types such as Klefki, Skarmory, Bronzong, support Jirachi, Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and Mega Scizor can tank any of Arceus-Fairy's moves, are immune to Toxic, and can inflict it with status or stack entry hazards in return.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar is able to trap Arceus-Fairy and deal significant damage to it with its Poison-type STAB moves. Arceus-Fairy can potentially knock it out with Earth Power, but Mega Gengar also has access to Destiny Bond to force a trade.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon resists Arceus-Fairy’s Judgment and can inflict it with status, set Stealth Rock, or set up.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: If Arceus-Fairy lacks Stone Edge, Ho-Oh is able to comfortably switch into any of its moves, although Toxic is still punishing.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Steel-types</strong>: Offensive Steel-types, such as Dialga, Excadrill, Mega Lucario, and Choice Scarf Jirachi, are either faster or can tank any of Arceus-Fairy's moves and can smack it with their super effective Steel-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Toxic Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Arceus-Water, Lugia, and Blissey dislike Toxic but can poison Arceus-Fairy in return. They are especially strong checks to the Recover + 3 Attacks set.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Setup Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Xerneas and Primal Kyogre can boost their Special Attack and Special Defense stats enough to overwhelm Arceus-Fairy.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Recover keeps Arceus-Fairy healthy when facing balance and offense teams. Stone Edge is used exclusively to beat Ho-Oh, a major threat that sees common use on balance and bulky offense teams, which this set aims to dismantle. Earth Power smacks Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Mega Gengar, as well as some of the niche Steel-types used in Ubers all in one moveslot. Toxic also annoys Primal Groudon and cripples Calm Mind Arceus formes that may attempt to set up, but it will leave Arceus-Fairy easily walled by most Steel-types. Judgment is Arceus-Fairy's primary source of firepower, allowing it to KO threats such as Mega Salamence, Darkrai, Giratina-O, Mega Sableye, Rayquaza, and Yveltal.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment ensures Arceus-Fairy outspeeds Mega Lucario and everything slower and, at worst, Speed ties an unboosted Mega Salamence and opposing Arceus formes. The remaining EV investment is used for mixed bulk. Pixie Plate is required to use Arceus-Fairy and grants a power boost to Judgment.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used to lure in and KO Pokemon commonly employed on balance and bulky offenses to keep Fairy-types in line. The set is mostly used as a pivot, meaning that it doesn't hate Toxic as much as certain support Arceus formes do, though paralysis is very annoying. When used alongside a Pokemon like Xerneas, this set should seek to chip down Pokemon that are used by the opponent to check the teammate of interest. Recover should be used to maintain Arceus-Fairy's health when it needs to check Pokemon such as Darkrai, Yveltal, and offensive Dragon-types. Be aware that this set cannot withstand a boosted Adamant Mega Salamence's Double-Edge after it has taken Stealth Rock damage. It also takes more than 75% from Choice Band Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is an almost mandatory teammate for this set due to the support it provides against Steel-types, Xerneas, and Primal Kyogre. Ho-Oh also fits well on bulky offense teams that utilize this Arceus-Fairy set due to how Ho-Oh stallbreaks and threatens a variety of Steel-types. Primal Kyogre can be used for additional pressure against opposing Primal Groudon, and a defensive Rest Primal Kyogre can effectively absorb Toxic aimed at Arceus-Fairy. Since the Arceus teamslot is allocated to a forme that does not run Defog, alternative Defoggers such as Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O are appreciated. Although Xerneas creates some defensive redundancies with this set, Arceus-Fairy is able to lure or deal chip damage to a variety of Geomancy Xerneas checks, which Xerneas can benefit from later on.Using Mega Gengar can make fitting a Defogger on the team a bit challenging, although it is able to trap and KO a variety of Pokemon that are able to wall Arceus-Fairy. Yveltal can be used alongside Arceus-Fairy to overload Pokemon such as Klefki, while Mewtwo benefits from Arceus-Fairy's ability to check Mega Sableye and pressure Primal Groudon.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Arceus-Fairy can be a successful Stealth Rock setter, as it is able to defeat a variety of Defog users, such as Giratina-O, Latios, Latias, Mega Salamence, and Arceus-Dragon, in addition to being able to defeat Mega Sableye. Recover is necessary to maintain Arceus-Fairy's health against certain offensive threats and to maintain its longevity, as it may need to set up Stealth Rock more than once. Judgment is Arceus-Fairy's primary form of damage output, allowing it to beat the previously mentioned Defoggers and heavily damaging Pokemon such as Darkrai, Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Zekrom. Toxic is used to deter Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon and to give Arceus-Fairy a way to damage Arceus-Water. Earth Power can be used to damage Primal Groudon as well, and it has the benefit of dealing chip damage to Klefki and niche Steel-types; it also makes the set less vulnerable to Mega Gengar at the cost of Arceus-Fairy not having anything to really hit Ho-Oh or Arceus-Water with.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed investment allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza and everything slower than that. The remaining EVs are slotted into HP and then Defense so that Arceus-Fairy can check physically offensive threats, such as Mega Salamence. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Jolly Rayquaza and maximum Speed base 90 Speed Pokemon. Pixie Plate is required to use Arceus-Fairy and gives Judgment a power boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Fairy is effective at setting Stealth Rock, so get it set sooner rather than later. One major annoyance this Pokemon has as a Stealth Rock setter is that it invites Ho-Oh in, while the most do to Ho-Oh is set up Stealth Rock or use Toxic on it. Defog users that you can't beat using Judgment should be hit with Toxic and worn down. If not using Earth Power, this set can be eliminated by Mega Gengar quite easily; if it is using Earth Power, you need to smack a Mega Evolved Gengar on the switch to force a trade at worst. This set is complete entry hazard bait against Klefki if it doesn't run Earth Power and will struggle against Skarmory and Ferrothorn regardless. In such situations, you will likely need to double switch to a Pokemon such as Ho-Oh to minimize the amount of hazards the foe can set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set frees Primal Groudon from having to run Stealth Rock, so a Swords Dance, double dance, or Rock Polish set is naturally an effective partner. Ho-Oh fares very well against some of the Pokemon this set struggles to damage, such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Giratina-O, Latios, Latias, or Mega Salamence can be used as Defog users, as this set does not run it. Tyranitar or other Pursuit support is useful for keeping Mega Gengar in line, especially if this set isn't running Earth Power; Tyranitar doubles as a Ho-Oh check as well. A defensive Primal Kyogre set with Rest can be used as a status sponge, since Lugia, Arceus-Water, and Skarmory like to throw Toxic at Arceus-Fairy but are all checked by Primal Kyogre. Mega Sableye can be used as a teammate because its ability, Magic Bounce, helps prevent the opponent from stacking entry hazards.</p>"

  "Arceus-Fighting": {
    "overview": "<p>A mono-Fighting typing gives Arceus-Fighting the ability to check relevant threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Darkrai, Arceus-Rock, Tyranitar, and Dialga. Arceus-Fighting also has the raw stats and an excellent movepool that is available to all Arceus formes. Thanks to being rarely utilized, Arceus-Fighting can function as a lure and easily surprise opponents. Fighting isn't a very good type offensively, due to relevant Ghost-types such as Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Mega Sableye being immune to Arceus-Fighting's Judgment. Defensively, Arceus-Fighting's typing isn't stellar either, as it is weak to Ho-Oh's, Xerneas's, and Mega Salamence's STAB attacks while offering no useful resistances. Arceus-Fighting also tends to perform poorly against defensive teams, and it is vulnerable to all status and entry hazards. Arceus-Fighting is almost always a waste of an Arceus forme; reconsider using this Pokemon as it has little to no niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set can be utilized in an effort to make Arceus-Fighting more useful against defensive teams; however, the nature of Fighting-type Judgment makes other Calm Mind Arceus formes a better choice in this role. Sludge Bomb can be used to pound away at Fairy-type switches and spread poison; however, hitting Mega Salamence or Ho-Oh with Arceus-Fighting's coverage move is usually more relevant and potent. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers, although some common switch-ins to Arceus-Fighting, such as Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy, are immune or don't mind a burn much. A Defog support set is an option; however, this limits Arceus-Fighting to either status or a coverage move further increasing the number of threats that can easily switch into it. Roar can be used to phaze away Pokemon that attempt to setup on Arceus-Fighting, while Magic Coat can reflect status and entry hazards, although it is hard to find room for either of these moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, Mega Diancie, and Clefable all resist Arceus-Fighting's Judgment and can retaliate with strong super effective Fairy-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, Mega Gengar, Mega Sableye, and Aegislash are all immune to Arceus-Fighting's Judgment and can threaten it with status. Mega Gengar in particular outspeeds Arceus-Fighting and can trap it with Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Flying-Types</strong>: Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, Lugia, Yveltal, Shaymin-S, and Arceus-Flying have a type advantage against Arceus-Fighting, allowing them to threaten it with powerful Flying-type moves. However, Ho-Oh fears Stone Edge, Mega Salamence, Shaymin-S, and Yveltal fear Ice Beam, and Lugia fears Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre has the sheer special bulk to tank Arceus-Fighting's Judgment and can retaliate with powerful rain-boosted Water-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, and Arceus-Psychic resist Arceus-Fighting's Judgment and can deal significant damage in return with their Psychic-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Although Blissey takes 2x super effective damage from Arceus-Fighting's Judgment, its special bulk is extensive enough to where it can still stall out Arceus-Fighting with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Arceus-Fighting relies greatly on its Speed advantage to check threats, and, if Arceus-Fighting is paralyzed, it is less effective at making use of the effects of Thunder Wave itself.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic poison causes Arceus-Fighting to have to recover more often, prevents it from staying in for long periods of time, and deals enough residual damage to make it more difficult to check intended threats.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Judgment is Arceus-Fighting's specialty, allowing it to rip apart Extreme Killer Arceus, Darkrai, Dialga, Arceus-Dark, Tyranitar, Mega Kangaskhan, and Arceus-Rock, while also dealing significant damage to Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Ferrothorn. Recover prevents Arceus-Fighting from being worn down after repeated switch-ins, allowing it to function beyond a one time check. Thunder Wave cripples common switch-ins to Arceus-Fighting such as Arceus-Ghost, Latias, Latios, Mega Gengar, and Mewtwo, and prevents it from being setup bait for Geomancy Xerneas. Stone Edge destroys Ho-Oh and provides a means of hitting airborne or Levitating targets that are immune to or resist Arceus-Fighting's STAB attack. Ice Beam is used to blow away potential Mega Salamence switch-ins or Mega Salamence that set up; it also destroys Rayquaza and hits Pokemon such as Giratina-O, Latias, and Latios. Toxic can be used instead of Thunder Wave in order to better punish Arceus-Ghost while still retaining methods of punishing Latios and Latias switch-ins; however, it worsens the matchup against Mega Gengar and Xerneas to some degree.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs maximize the probability that Arceus-Fighting will OHKO Extreme Killer Arceus, and they also ensure that Ice Beam OHKOes Mega Salamence. In general, the Special Attack EVs also help offset how poorly Arceus-Fighting preforms against defensive teams. 96 Speed EVs with a Timid nature ensure that Arceus-Fighting is faster than Mega Kangaskhan, which is also fast enough to move before Rayquaza variants, and Latios and Latias that aren't maximum Speed. This investment is also enough to outspeed Mega Salamence before Mega Evolution so that Arceus-Fighting can knock it out with Ice Beam. The remaining 160 EVs are allocated to HP so that Arceus-Fighting better takes +2 Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus in addition to attacks from Darkrai and Dialga. A Fist Plate is required to use Arceus-Fighting, and it boosts the power of Judgment. A spread of 44 Def / 252 SpA / 212 Spe with a Modest nature allows Arceus-Fighting to OHKO bulky Extreme Killer Arceus while still retaining enough Speed to outrun Mega Kangaskhan at the cost of the ability to switch into special attacks as well. Another spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature is an option to outspeed Mega Lucario, Mega Diancie, and Speed tie with opposing Arceus formes at the cost of not being able to check Extreme Killer Arceus and other special attackers with as much leniency.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Fighting's go-to move to prevent big threats from getting free switch-ins is Thunder Wave. Paralysis cripples any threat that is faster than Arceus-Fighting, barring Arceus-Ground and the rare Arceus-Electric. Ground-types don't really switch into Arceus-Fighting's Judgment well, as it deals significant damage even to specially defensive Primal Groudon. Although Arceus-Fighting is a solid check to Tyranitar, beware of Thunder Wave if you're switching it in, as paralysis eliminates the Speed advantage Arceus-Fighting has over many threats. If Arceus-Fighting is to serve as a counter to Extreme Killer Arceus, it must be at or near full health. This means that it is important to keep Arceus-Fighting at high HP as long as an opposing Extreme Killer Arceus is alive. Arceus-Fighting has enough bulk to tank any of Darkrai's moves at +2, although bad luck with sleep turns can give Darkrai enough time to KO Arceus-Fighting before it can wake up, so using another Pokemon as sleep fodder to Dark Void, then switching in Arceus-Fighting is usually a safer method of checking Darkrai. Although it is far from indestructible, Arceus-Fighting is capable of liberally switching into powerful threats such as Dialga, Kyurem-W, and even predicted Earthquakes or Extreme Speeds from Rayquaza, although Dragon Ascent makes doing so risky. Do not risk keeping Arceus-Fighting in against a previously Mega Evolved Salamence if your team has a safe switch-in for it, as several spreads are faster than Arceus-Fighting.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon covers Arceus-Fighting's weakness to Fairy-types, Ho-Oh, and Primal Kyogre. Xerneas benefits from Arceus-Fighting's ability to check Steel-types, Mega Kangaskhan, and Extreme Killer Arceus, and, in return, Xerneas can check Latios and Latias. Primal Kyogre appreciates Arceus-Fighting's ability to check Pokemon such as Dialga and Ferrothorn, while Primal Kyogre can tackle Ho-Oh and Ghost-types. Mega Salamence greatly benefits from Arceus-Fighting's ability to check Arceus-Rock. Arceus-Fighting can check Arceus-Dark for Latios and Latias, and, in return, they can provide Defog support for Arceus-Fighting. Ho-Oh provides a switch-in for Fairy-type moves aimed at Arceus-Fighting, and Arceus-Fighting can check Arceus-Rock for Ho-Oh in return. Yveltal also appreciates Arceus-Fighting's ability to check Arceus-Rock, although it does stack a weakness to Fairy-types. Ferrothorn can be used in order to provide Arceus-Fighting with a Fairy-type switch-in and a Primal Kyogre switch-in, and it offers an immunity to Toxic aimed at Arceus-Fighting. Aegislash can provide a switch-in for Fairy-types and also provide a Toxic immunity. Tyranitar can be used to check Pokemon that threaten Arceus-Fighting, such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Latios, and Latias, and, in return, Arceus-Fighting checks Dialga. Rayquaza benefits from Arceus-Fighting's ability to check Arceus-Rock and Tyranitar; two common switch-ins to Dragon Ascent. Zekrom can threaten Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Primal Kyogre, all of which are common and powerful checks to Arceus-Fighting. Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Mega Lucario can all be used as offensive partners that check Fairy-types that threaten Arceus-Fighting.</p>"

  "Arceus-Fire": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Fire is the best specially oriented Fire-type in Ubers, notably being able to defeat Mega Salamence with Ice Beam; it also has the perk of being much faster than both Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. However, this does not change the fact that Arceus-Fire is an awful Pokemon. It loses to so many common threats that it suffers from severe four-moveslot syndrome, being unable to deal with all of its many checks with three attacking moves. This also means it cannot viably run Recover, greatly reducing its longevity. While Fire is a good offensive typing with decent coverage, Arceus-Fire's STAB is neutered by Primal Kyogre's Primordial Sea. Arceus-Fire's typing also leaves it vulnerable to all entry hazards and grants it a weakness to Stealth Rock, compounding its longevity issues. Arceus-Fire has some decent resistances, most notably to Fairy-type attacks, but it cannot really make use of them because it can't afford to invest in defenses. This, unfortunately, means that Arceus-Fire is a complete waste of your Arceus slot and should never be used seriously.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge can catch out Ho-Oh switch-ins, but it fails to OHKO unless Ho-Oh has taken some prior damage and is useless in any other situation, as, without Attack investment, it is extremely weak. A specially defensive set with Roar and Recover can check and phaze Xerneas, but Primal Groudon does this far better. Recover could be used over one of Arceus-Fire's coverage moves, but this leaves Arceus-Fire even more easily walled than it already is. Spacial Rend can be used if Arceus-Fire is running a Modest nature, as it can 2HKO Latios, Giratina-O, and Arceus-Dragon after Stealth Rock, as well as the rare Kyurem-W, Reshiram, and Palkia. However, this comes at the cost of a coverage move, which means Arceus-Fire will still be walled by a great deal of Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon shrugs off any attack besides Earth Power. It can then either force Arceus-Fire out and set up or destroy Arceus-Fire that dare to stay in with Precipice Blades.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey are not fazed by any of Arceus-Fire's moves thanks to their titanic special bulk and can easily Toxic stall it.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar takes very little damage from all of Arceus-Fire's attacks. It can then set up Stealth Rock or paralyze Arceus-Fire and wear it down with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Rock</strong>: Arceus-Rock does not even fear Earth Power, as Modest Arceus-Fire cannot 2HKO it. It can then proceed to 2HKO Arceus-Fire with Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Excadrill</strong>: Excadrill cannot switch into Judgment, but it can easily come in on any other move while sand is up and OHKO Arceus-Fire with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: While Calm Mind Primal Kyogre is a shaky switch-in because it is often 2HKOed by Modest Arceus-Fire's Thunder after Stealth Rock, other variants can switch in without fearing the 2HKO and can OHKO Arceus-Fire with their rain-boosted Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh's special bulk means that it takes a pittance from Arceus-Fire's moves and can force it out or 2HKO it with Brave Bird or Earthquake. However, it cannot safely switch in while Stealth Rock is up, as Thunder will 2HKO it and a boosted Thunder will OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence and Rayquaza</strong>: If Arceus-Fire is not running Ice Beam, Mega Salamence and Rayquaza become extremely threatening to it. In particular, bulky Dragon Dance variants of Mega Salamence that carry Refresh can even shrug off paralysis from Thunder and easily set up on Arceus-Fire.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie</strong>: If Arceus-Fire lacks Earth Power, Mega Diancie can 2HKO it with Diamond Storm while avoiding the 2HKO from any of Arceus-Fire's moves.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: While Arceus-Fire can chip away at Latios and Latias with Ice Beam, both still force it out. In particular, Latios can OHKO Arceus-Fire with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock. Both Pokemon also completely wall Arceus-Fire that lack Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: Arceus-Ground is never 2HKOed by Timid Arceus-Fire's Judgment or Ice Beam at full health and can OHKO it with Earthquake after Stealth Rock without needing to boost.</p> <p><strong>Palkia</strong>: While rare, Palkia fears nothing Arceus-Fire runs and destroys it with Hydro Pump.</p>",

      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Arceus-Fire to set up on the few threats it forces out, such as some Steel-types. Judgment is a powerful STAB attack with no drawbacks and has the bonus of hitting Primal Groudon switch-ins for decent damage thanks to the sun that it brings. Overheat is stronger than Judgment, but the Special Attack drop caused by using it makes it a risky option, as Arceus-Fire will then become setup fodder for threats such as Primal Groudon and Geomancy Xerneas. Thunder hits Primal Kyogre switch-ins for decent damage while possibly paralyzing them. It is also Arceus-Fire's only means of doing meaningful damage to Ho-Oh. Ice Beam destroys Mega Salamence and Rayquaza switch-ins while dealing some damage to Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O. Earth Power hits Primal Groudon harder than Judgment and Overheat but provides no other meaningful coverage and is less useful than Ice Beam in general.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed is necessary for Arceus-Fire to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature is preferred to Speed tie with maximum Speed Arceus formes. However, Modest is usable if extra power is desired; importantly, Modest Arceus-Fire's Thunder is usually able to 2HKO Calm Mind Primal Kyogre switch-ins after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The best way to use Arceus-Fire is to not use it at all. If you must use Arceus-Fire, you should switch it in whenever possible so it can do as much damage as possible before it faints. Unfortunately, Arceus-Fire cannot even do this well thanks to its subpar defensive typing, glaring weakness to every entry hazard, and susceptibility to being statused by the Steel-types it should be able to counter such as Ferrothorn. This means that its best opportunities to switch in are when a teammate has fainted or when U-turn support is provided. If run, Overheat should be used with caution, as the Special Attack drop caused by using it makes Arceus-Fire setup fodder for a plethora of threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Arceus-Fire necessitates Defog users as teammates due to its entry hazard weakness and lack of recovery. Latios, Giratina-O, and Latias can provide this support while also providing Arceus-Fire a teammate with a Ground-type immunity. Grass Knot Latias deserves a special mention for being able to deal with Swords Dance Arceus-Ground. Magic Bounce support from Pokemon such as Mega Diancie is also highly useful; Mega Diancie can also deal with Ho-Oh, one of Arceus-Fire's hardest checks. Conversely, entry hazard support is crucial to wear down Ho-Oh switch-ins as well as checks that will inevitably switch into Arceus-Fire. Primal Groudon, Dialga, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie can all set up Stealth Rock. Primal Kyogre greatly threatens Arceus-Fire, so Primal Groudon, Latios, and Latias make for good teammates. If Earth Power is chosen, Arceus-Fire will be helpless against Latios and Latias; in this case, Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Tyranitar is appreciated. Using Earth Power also renders Arceus-Fire susceptible to Mega Salamence, which Dialga and Tyranitar can deal with for Arceus-Fire. Finally, regular Groudon is an acceptable option, as it can set up Stealth Rock, check Primal Groudon, and provide sun support, greatly boosting the power of Arceus-Fire's STAB move.</p>"

  "Arceus-Flying": {
    "overview": "<p>The threat that Mega Salamence poses has brought out a number of Flying-resistant Pokemon on almost every team, leaving Arceus-Flying easier to check. This makes Arceus-Flying harder to justify using over Mega Salamence, as Arceus-Flying has less usable resistances while also being weak to Stealth Rock. The decline of stall teams also hurts Arceus-Flying, as its main role was to be a stallbreaker. On the upside, Primal Groudon helps Arceus-Flying tremendously, as it can handle almost all of Arceus-Flying's weaknesses. Flying as an offensive typing is still very potent, and Arceus-Flying is still the best specially based Flying-type in the tier. It also has a cool bonus of being the only Arceus forme not hurt by both forms of Spikes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder is a potential coverage option for Arceus-Flying that allows it to take on Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, and it also hits Ho-Oh for heavy damage. Focus Blast can hit Mega Aerodactyl, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie. Will-O-Wisp can catch an aggressive Zekrom and neutralize it for the match, and it can get chip damage on Arceus-Flying's switch-ins, but is fairly niche otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: While Zekrom is uncommon in ORAS Ubers, it is the biggest counter to Arceus-Flying. It can switch in on any move at least once except for the rare Will-O-Wisp and OHKO with Bolt Strike. Earth Power does considerable damage, however.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock types such as Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Arceus-Rock resist Judgment and can deal heavy damage with their STAB moves. Arceus-Rock can have trouble handling Arceus-Flying after a few Calm Mind boosts unless it too has Calm Mind, however. Earth Power can also hit all Rock-type switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable is typically seen on stall teams, as its Calm Mind set with Unaware allows it to beat any stallbreaker Arceus. Arceus-Flying is no exception, and it needs support from its teammates to bypass this Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Electric</strong>: Arceus-Electric has taken a big drop in viability in ORAS Ubers, and therefore isn't very common. However, it can still beat Arceus-Flying with ease.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types, namely Kyurem-W and Arceus-Ice, do not resist Judgment, but can hit Arceus-Flying very hard with their STAB moves. Arceus-Flying needs Calm Mind boosts just to avoid being OHKOed by these Pokemon and should avoid fighting them if possible.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Dialga, and Klefki can prove to be very annoying for Arceus-Flying to break past without multiple Calm Mind boosts. These Steel-types tend to have trouble actually breaking though Arceus-Flying on their own, however.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that boast good Special Defense such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh can switch into Arceus-Flying and beat it.</p> <p><strong>Darkrai</strong>: Darkrai will outspeed Arceus-Flying and can put it to sleep before it can do anything. However, if Arceus-Flying already has Calm Mind boosts, Darkrai can have trouble actually winning the scenario without Nasty Plot boosts and good sleep rolls. Darkrai cannot directly switch into Arceus-Flying, either.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind and Refresh allow Arceus-Flying to break through stall teams and bulky threats with just its Flying-type STAB move as its only attack, as it has no immunities and not many Pokemon in Ubers resist Flying. Judgment is the most reliable and powerful Flying-type move that Arceus-Flying can use, and it also comes with a decent amount of PP, which is a nice selling point for a Pokemon that is dedicated to breaking bulkier teams. Recover helps Arceus-Flying stick around and consistently threaten the enemy team. Earth Power is an alternative over Refresh that hits many of the Flying-type resistances in the tier such as Aegislash, Jirachi, Mega Diancie, and Tyranitar. Substitute can be used over Refresh or Earth Power if you would rather avoid status completely, or to have some breathing room to rack up Calm Mind boosts on predicted switches. It can also help Arceus-Flying avoid being phazed by Dragon Tail users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>132 HP EVs give Arceus-Flying the ability to live Primal Groudon's Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage while also allowing it to make 101 HP Substitutes, meaning Seismic Toss cannot break them in one hit. 200 Special Attack EVs with a Modest Nature give Judgment the power to OHKO Mega Mewtwo X and 2HKO the standard Primal Groudon set. It also has a small chance to 2HKO Latios after Stealth Rock damage. 176 Speed EVs allow Arceus-Flying to outspeed anything up to Modest maximum Speed Latios and Latias.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Flying's main role is to be a stallbreaker, which is a Pokemon that can dismantle very bulky teams without any support, as Flying is effective as the only attack type on a set because it has no immunities. Arceus-Flying's great bulk also helps it accomplish this role. If facing stall or generally bulky teams, bring Arceus-Flying in on predicted Ground-type moves, or status moves such as Toxic, if carrying Refresh. From there, judge if there is any immediate threat to Arceus-Flying, such as the potential that the opposing Pokemon has a strong Rock-type coverage move. If things look safe and the foe will switch out, set up Calm Mind boosts and break through the foe. Some stall teams carry dedicated answers to stallbreakers such as Arceus-Flying, therefore it's a good idea to keep an eye out for Pokemon such as Snatch Blissey or Calm Mind Clefable, as Arceus-Flying cannot break past these Pokemon without the help of teammates. Against more offensive teams, Arceus-Flying works best as a late-game cleaner once Pokemon resistant to Flying such as Tyranitar or Steel-types are worn down sufficiently. Arceus-Flying can switch into specially defensive Primal Groudon with ease if carrying Refresh, but this set tends to have Roar, so don't set up Calm Mind boosts recklessly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The best partner Arceus-Flying can have is Primal Groudon by a mile. Primal Groudon can check Rock-types, Steel-types, Ho-Oh if running Stone Edge, and Zekrom, and it can also handle any Electric- or Ice-type attacks thrown at Arceus-Flying, all while being able to set up Stealth Rock to pressure switches. Defog users such as Giratina-O, Latios, Latias, and Mega Scizor can remove Stealth Rock that can annoy Arceus-Flying. A core of a Fairy-type and a Ground-type can keep Zekrom guessing, as a wrong prediction from the Zekrom user can lead to a free switch for your team. Checks to Ho-Oh such as defensive Mega Salamence, Stone Edge Primal Groudon, and Tyranitar make for effective partners, as Arceus-Flying can have trouble breaking a healthy Ho-Oh on its own. Primal Kyogre checks such as Latias, Primal Groudon, and Palkia are appreciated, as a Calm Mind set can beat Arceus-Flying in a one-on-one scenario. Physical attackers such as Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence can put pressure on specially bulky walls, allowing Arceus-Flying to break past them later in the match. Mega Gengar can trap and remove Clefable and other defensive Pokemon that can typically deal with Arceus-Flying. Excadrill can work as a check to Electric- and Ice-type attackers, and it can also use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock for Arceus-Flying; pair Excadrill with Tyranitar for a nice combination that can help out Arceus-Flying.</p>"

  "Arceus-Ghost": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Ghost possesses a myriad of positive traits, including a solid offensive and defensive typing along with the ability to handle common threats to offense such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Kangaskhan, and Latios, making it a good choice for offensive teams that require a solid setup sweeper that is able to handle these common threats. With base 120 stats across the board, Arceus-Ghost naturally has a good Speed tier and strong offensive prowess, combined with the ability to use both Swords Dance and Calm Mind sets backed up by solid high-Base Power STAB attacks in Shadow Force and Judgment that allow it to break down common walls in the Uber tier such as Lugia and Giratina-O. Unlike other Swords Dance variants of Arceus such as Extreme Killer, it is able to escape from Shadow Tag users such as Mega Gengar, therefore avoiding being revenge killed or trapped.</p> <p>However, Arceus-Ghost suffers from being vulnerable to Dark-types, a somewhat common offensive typing in the Ubers metagame, and Pokemon such as Yveltal and Darkrai are able to easily dispatch of Arceus-Ghost or force it to switch out. Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost in particular is blocked by Yveltal due to its natural bulk, and Yveltal's Dark / Flying typing means Arceus-Ghost's Brick Break does very little to it. Arceus-Dark is also able to handle both Arceus-Ghost sets and scare it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Ghost can attempt a support set with Defog and Will-O-Wisp and maximum Speed and HP on specific teambuilds that already have Ho-Oh covered, but it's best left to other support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon, which can check Ho-Oh, have a superior defensive typing, and generally fit on a greater variety of team builds. Thunder can be used over Focus Blast to hit Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Kyogre harder; however, Arceus-Ghost loses out on perfect coverage and the ability to hit Tyranitar, Blissey, and Chansey for any reasonable amount of damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Darkrai</strong>: Darkrai can cripple Arceus-Ghost with Dark Void or revenge kill it with Dark Pulse, though it has to be wary of Brick Break or Focus Blast while trying to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Yveltal generally walls Swords Dance sets, and defensive Yveltal prevents Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost from executing a sweep. Arceus-Ghost takes a lot from Dark Pulse on offensive variants and can be picked off by Sucker Punch when weakened.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh gives special variants of Arceus-Ghost a hard time due to its high Special Defense, especially if Stealth Rock isn't up; physical Arceus-Ghost also has to be wary of Sacred Fire burns.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Dark</strong>: Albeit rare, Arceus-Dark can take on both Arceus-Ghost sets and scare it out or even try to set up Calm Mind on it, taking little from an unboosted Brick Break, though it has to take caution switching into Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Gengar can't switch in or Mega Evolve safely on Arceus-Ghost; however, it can revenge kill a weakened Arceus-Ghost if it has Mega Evolved. Note, though, that Arceus-Ghost is able to escape Shadow Tag.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: While Giratina-O can't switch in on Arceus-Ghost, it does a considerable amount of damage with Shadow Sneak, so it can pick off weakened ones; additionally, Arceus-Ghost lacking Shadow Claw could potentially lose to Shadow Force Giratina-O due to Giratina being slower. Giratina-O is 2HKOed by Judgment and Shadow Claw, however.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey can cripple Arceus-Ghost with Toxic, though they are setup fodder for Substitute sets and lose to Swords Dance variants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance provides Arceus-Ghost with the ability to set up and potentially threaten a sweep backed by Shadow Force, which is able to OHKO the majority of the tier at +2; however, the charge turn makes Arceus-Ghost very prone to momentum loss and can allow a free switch to a Pokemon immune to it such as Extreme Killer Arceus. Brick Break is an obligatory coverage move in order to hit Normal-types such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Kangaskhan and to gain super effective coverage on Dark-types such as Darkrai that tend to switch in; however, it is relatively weak and should only be used for these desired targets. Extreme Speed gives Arceus-Ghost a form of priority and helps dispatch of common threats to offense such as Deoxys-A or pick off weakened faster targets such as Darkrai, and it can even help to win against Extreme Killer in one-on-one situations. Shadow Claw can be used in place of Extreme Speed on the final slot, if you're concerned about the unreliability or lack of PP that Shadow Force possesses, providing for a weaker but more reliable STAB move that can prevent wasted usage of Shadow Force PP where Shadow Claw could OHKO a threat instead or prevent the opponent continuously switching between a Ghost- and Normal-type due to sets lacking Shadow Claw being blocked by this.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs enable Arceus-Ghost to maximize its offensive prowess, and a Jolly nature is used so Arceus-Ghost can at least Speed tie with other maximum Speed Arceus formes such as Extreme Killer Arceus, as well as outspeed other offensive threats such as Latios, Mega Lucario, and Gengar before it Mega Evolves. Gengar also is unable to Mega Evolve safely, or it risks being OHKOed by Shadow Force due to its ability to break Protect. An Adamant nature can be chosen for more power on specific team builds such as Sticky Web teams, which somewhat compensate for its very noticeable drop in Speed; however, Arceus-Ghost is then still outsped by the likes of Latios due its immunity to Sticky Web.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Preserving Arceus-Ghost is the most effective way for the Swords Dance set to be threatening, and it tends to be a later-game wincon. Never set up if the opponent still has healthy answers to Arceus-Ghost such as Dark-types; Yveltal in particular needs to be either weakened or removed before Arceus-Ghost can threaten a sweep, even if it has set up with Swords Dance, and Shadow Force leaves Arceus-Ghost vulnerable to Sucker Punch from Yveltal on the charge turn, meaning it will take heavy damage if it tries to take on Yveltal head on. Once Arceus-Ghost checks have been weakened or removed, you can set up Swords Dance and proceed to sweep. Lugia and Giratina-O are common physical walls that are weak to Ghost, making them somewhat good targets for setup. Arceus-Ghost can also offensively threaten Latios, Mewtwo, and Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairies such as Xerneas and Mega Diancie make good partners for their ability to take care of common answers to Arceus-Ghost; Choice Scarf Xerneas especially makes a good partner, being able to absorb sleep from Darkrai's Dark Void and easily dispatch of Darkrai. Arceus-Ghost has a good defensive typing for an offensive Arceus and has an immunity to Extreme Speed, a common priority move in the metagame. Deoxys-A appreciates this immunity because it falls to any strong priority move from the likes of Extreme Killer Arceus and Rayquaza; in return, it helps to break walls to allow Arceus-Ghost to sweep late-game or dispatch of faster threats on opposing offense. Darkrai is a threatening offensive partner with good synergy, being able to cripple switch-ins with Dark Void, putting them to sleep and thus potentially giving Arceus-Ghost an opportunity to set up, and to help pressure common Defoggers such as support Arceus formes and Giratina-O. Darkrai also appreciates Arceus-Ghost's immunity to Superpower and Extreme Speed from the likes of Deoxys-A, which tends to be a common revenge killer or anti-lead to it; if you predict either of these moves, Arceus-Ghost can switch in and try to scare Deoxys-A out. Rayquaza variants such as mixed and Choice Band sets make good partners due to their ability to help break down walls and pressure common Defoggers such as support Arceus formes; in return Rayquaza appreciates Arceus-Ghost's ability to check Extreme Speed users such as Arceus and Deoxys-A. Toxic Spikes offense builds are also a good idea, with setters such as Cloyster and Greninja being the most common, while Arceus-Ghost provides spinblocking utility thanks to its Ghost typing; one of the other main applications is the ability to rack up additional poison damage from Toxic Spikes and slowly put pressure on opposing teams with Shadow Force due to it being a two-turn move. Primal Groudon is usually the Stealth Rock setter of choice for Arceus-Ghost teams, with an offensive set being most effective. However, Rock Polish Primal Groudon can also help with opposing offense builds, while Swords Dance sets help break apart defensive cores. With a Rock Polish or Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Dialga with Shuca Berry makes a solid alternative offensive Stealth Rock setter, providing a Mega Salamence check for offense teams, as well as the ability to beat all Magic Bounce users and consistently get up Stealth Rock against them. Mega Salamence is able to help weaken defensive Yveltal variants with Double-Edge or OHKO offensive variants. Mega Salamence also gives more security versus Extreme Killer Arceus, taking some pressure off Arceus-Ghost.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Arceus-Ghost to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense simultaneously, providing it with potential to sweep while making it harder for special attackers to break through. Judgment is a reliable 100-Base Power STAB move, and Focus Blast provides Arceus-Ghost with perfect coverage, notably allowing it to hit Extreme Killer Arceus and Kangaskhan while denting switch-ins such as Tyranitar. Substitute helps protect Arceus-Ghost from crippling status moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs give Arceus-Ghost maximum offensive prowess, and a Timid nature means it at least Speed ties with opposing Arceus formes such as Extreme Killer Arceus; maximum Special Attack is used to deal as much damage as possible and so Arceus-Ghost can sweep with as few Calm Mind boosts as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is best to utilize Arceus-Ghost late-game to threaten a sweep if it's the main wincon; otherwise, it can help break the opposing team early- and mid-game. Setting up Calm Minds helps out Arceus-Ghost offensively and defensively, giving it good sweeping potential. Substitute enables Arceus-Ghost to set up Calm Mind much more safely by blocking status, which is a common response to a Calm Mind Arceus; the move can also be used to help counteract or even scout for aggressive play, which is generally much safer than just firing off Focus Blast; however, Arceus-Ghost can also lure in certain checks such as Tyranitar and Darkrai and dent them with Focus Blast on the switch in.</p> <p>Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost is actually really effective at dismantling stall teams; however, a healthy Multiscale Lugia can phaze Arceus-Ghost attempting to sweep, so it's essential to make sure Lugia has Multiscale broken first. Therefore, try to have Stealth Rock up versus stall so Lugia can't come in on Arceus-Ghost. Blissey and Chansey are common on stall and can be used as fodder for Substitute, though Arceus-Ghost will have a tough time setting up Calm Minds due to Snatch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setters of entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes make a good team option, with Greninja and Cloyster being good examples; Arceus-Ghost backs them up with its spinblocking ability, while Toxic Spikes help pressure support Arceus formes to force them to Recover and subsequently allow Arceus-Ghost to get a Calm Mind boost and then a Substitute. Primal Groudon is the most consistent Stealth Rock setter for Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost teams; special Arceus-Ghost sets tend to struggle against Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock being up and can't effectively break Lugia if Multiscale is intact. Rock Polish sets can also be considered with an alternative Stealth Rock setter such as Dialga; in return Dialga provides a more defined Mega Salamence check. Offensive variants of Yveltal can provide a breaker with immediate power and good offensive synergy along with a Ground immunity; Yveltal can help break down Arceus-Ghost checks and help it sweep late-game. Xerneas is a Fairy-type to consider to check Darkrai and Yveltal—either a Choice Scarf set to absorb sleep from Dark Void or Geomancy Xerneas with another Darkrai answer. Mega Diancie is also another option to consider to check Darkrai and Yveltal that also has the option to run Stealth Rock as an effective anti-lead to Deoxys-S and Darkrai, especially on hazard-stacking builds such as Toxic Spikes offense. Rayquaza sets such as MixQuaza, Dragon Dance, and Choice Band make effective wallbreakers paired with Arceus-Ghost to apply pressure on Defoggers, and Rayquaza appreciates the immunity to Extreme Speed Arceus-Ghost provides; Rayquaza also helps out against sand offense teams due to Air Lock. Mega Salamence is another Dragon type to consider as a wallbreaker with Double-Edge or even as a secondary wincon, being able to weaken common threats such as defensive Yveltal as well as providing a Primal Groudon check. Deoxys-A and Darkrai really appreciate Arceus-Ghost's ability to check Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Kangaskhan due to their weakness to strong priority, and they can help with revenge killing due to their high Speed; Deoxys-A is especially useful for dispatching of faster threats on opposing offense, due to its insanely high offensive stats enabling it to dent the opposition considerably. Darkrai is able to cripple switch-ins with Dark Void.</p>"

  "Arceus-Grass": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its unique typing, Arceus-Grass is one of the few Pokemon viable in Ubers that can counter Arceus-Ground and check Primal Kyogre, which can be useful for some offensive teams. Importantly, it receives STAB on Grass Knot, which allows it to deal significant damage to Primal Kyogre, several common support Arceus formes, and Primal Groudon. While Arceus-Grass's defensive typing is relatively mediocre, granting it weaknesses to common Flying- and Fire-type attacks, it can use this to its advantage by luring in threatening Pokemon, such as Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence, and striking them with the appropriate coverage move. However, Arceus-Grass brings little utility to a team outside of functioning as a situational lure or check to specific Pokemon, and it is only really useful a few times a match due to its highly offensive nature and inability to sweep. Arceus-Grass also brings with it significant opportunity cost, as a team's Arceus slot is often better used on a different forme.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Calm Mind and Defog sets are usable, but they are either better utilized by a different Arceus forme or require far too much team assistance to function adequately. Will-O-Wisp can be used over Ice Beam to burn Mega Salamence and Klefki on the switch in, but its usefulness is otherwise very situational. Similarly, Arceus-Grass can capitalize on its ability to deter Ground-types from switching in and use Thunder Wave, which can cripple Mega Gengar that attempt to switch in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Arceus-Grass is hopelessly walled by both Blissey and Chansey, which can either inflict paralysis on Arceus-Grass or freely set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Even if Multiscale is broken by Stealth Rock, Lugia takes very little damage from any of Arceus-Grass's attacks. It can then proceed to poison Arceus-Grass or phaze it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: If Arceus-Grass is not running Fire Blast, Steel-types, such as Bronzong, Aegislash, Klefki, Dialga, and Skarmory, wall Arceus-Grass and force it out, allowing them to set up.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon with a Fire-type Move</strong>: No Primal Groudon appreciates switching into Grass Knot, but all Primal Groudon that carry a Fire-type move can either heavily damage or outright KO Arceus-Grass.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: While it is 2HKOed by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage, Mega Gengar can switch in on anything else Arceus-Grass runs. It easily traps Arceus-Grass, outspeeds it, and almost always OHKOes it with Sludge Wave after Stealth Rock damage. However, Mega Gengar does not appreciate being paralyzed by the uncommon Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Latios and Latias take some damage from Ice Beam, but they can force out Arceus-Grass with the threat of a powerful Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: If Arceus-Grass chooses to forgo Ice Beam, Mega Salamence switches in on any of Arceus-Grass's other moves and uses it as setup bait. Mega Salamence that do not carry Refresh can be surprised by the uncommon Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Niche Arceus Formes</strong>: While very uncommon, Arceus-Fire and Arceus-Poison are never 2HKOed by any of Arceus-Grass's moves, allowing them to easily switch in and either 2HKO Arceus-Grass with their STAB moves or use it as setup bait. Arceus-Steel also walls any Arceus-Grass that lack Fire Blast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Grass Knot is Arceus-Grass's best STAB move. It OHKOes Swords Dance Arceus-Ground after Stealth Rock damage, 2HKOes all Primal Kyogre variants, and almost always 2HKOes specially defensive Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage. It also has a high chance of OHKOing certain support Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Rock, after Stealth Rock damage. Stone Edge hits Ho-Oh, OHKOing 248 HP variants after Stealth Rock or if it has taken a small amount of prior damage. Ice Beam OHKOes Mega Salamence, heavily damages Yveltal, and is Arceus-Grass's best way of hitting Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O. Fire Blast can be chosen over Ice Beam to hit Steel-types on the switch, which would otherwise wall Arceus-Grass. However, this leaves Arceus-Grass helpless against Mega Salamence, which is not recommended. Fire Blast also cannot be overly relied on to deal with Klefki; while it does good damage, it does not OHKO, rendering Arceus-Grass susceptible to being statused. Recover is mandatory, as it allows Arceus-Grass to regain health on the switches it forces against threats such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Rock, Primal Kyogre, and the uncommon regular Groudon, letting it check these Pokemon throughout a match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed maximizes Arceus-Grass's offensive presence. A Timid nature allows Arceus-Grass to Speed tie with Arceus-Ground. No Attack investment is required, as Stone Edge hits Ho-Oh for excellent damage as is.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot Arceus-Grass in on Pokemon it forces out, such as Mega Diancie, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water. Depending on Arceus-Grass's health, it can then either use whichever move hits the predicted switch-in for optimal damage or Recover so that it can come in later. Do not switch Arceus-Grass in too recklessly. Against Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, which commonly carry a Fire-type move that can destroy Arceus-Grass, determining an opposing moveset can assist in choosing whether to switch Arceus-Grass in or not. For the most part, Arceus-Grass should avoid status, especially paralysis. However, if running Fire Blast, its susceptibility to paralysis can make Arceus-Grass able to deal with Klefki should this be necessary; bear in mind, however, that Fire Blast is not an OHKO on Klefki, meaning Arceus-Grass will be forced out by the threat of Thunder Wave or Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is an extremely useful teammate for Arceus-Grass. Arceus-Grass checks Arceus-Ground for Primal Groudon; in return, Primal Groudon can set up Stealth Rock, which wears down Arceus-Grass's switch-ins and allows it to more effectively damage foes. If not running Fire Blast on Arceus-Grass, it is recommended that Primal Groudon carries a Fire-type move so that it can effectively deal with the Steel-types that bother Arceus-Grass. Sweepers that appreciate Arceus-Grass's ability to remove Ho-Oh, such as Xerneas, also pair well with Arceus-Grass. Arceus-Grass appreciates Defog support, as it tends to be worn down by entry hazards. Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O are thus good teammates, as they can provide all of Defog support, a check to Primal Groudon, and, in the case of Latios and Latias, an extra Primal Kyogre check. However, Excadrill is also a viable option, as it appreciates Arceus-Grass's ability to deal with Ground-types, Primal Kyogre, and Giratina-O; in return, Excadrill deals with the Steel-types that wall Arceus-Grass and removes entry hazards from play with Rapid Spin. Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Aegislash, can trap Latios, Latias, and, in particular, Mega Gengar, which is otherwise very threatening to Arceus-Grass. As Arceus-Grass is a good check to Arceus-Rock, Pokemon that appreciate its removal, such as Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence, also make for excellent partners; Ho-Oh can beat Steel-types, while Mega Salamence can take advantage of Arceus-Grass's luring abilities to sweep late-game.</p>"

  "Arceus-Ground": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Ground has a number of niches, allowing it to fill a useful role on many balanced teams. With excellent bulk and base 120 stats across the board, Arceus-Ground is able to excellently support its team or threaten to sweep with a Swords Dance set. The most important defensive role for Arceus-Ground is to check perhaps the most threatening Pokemon in the metagame, Primal Groudon, with its super effective Ground-type STAB moves. It also threatens many entry hazard users such as Klefki, Dialga, Primal Groudon, Tyranitar, and Diancie, with the deadly Swords Dance set having an easy time setting up against them. It has the ability to sweep through a significant number of Pokemon thanks to the coverage that EdgeQuake provides. However, Arceus-Ground lacks the power to immediately break through Pokemon, and it has redundant type synergy with Primal Groudon. Luckily, Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Kyogre and Arceus-Grass are uncommon, allowing Arceus-Ground to be even deadlier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Both Shadow Force and Refresh have a tiny niche, with Shadow Force arguably having a bigger one. Shadow Force circumvents Giratina-O and the uncommon Giratina checking Arceus-Ground reliably and can damage Lugia more than Stone Edge while still hitting Pokemon such as Latios and Latias. Because you give up important coverage in Stone Edge, which allows Arceus-Ground to hit Mega Salamence, among other things, you can also run Shadow Force alongside Stone Edge. Refresh can shrug off status ailments, such as the dreaded burn or Toxic from Klefki, for example, so that Arceus-Ground has more longevity. Extreme Speed can finish off Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill Arceus-Ground, such as Shaymin-S, Darkrai, and Mewtwo, though it is rather weak. For each of these options, it is hard to justify the loss of recovery. Dragon Claw still hits Mega Salamence as well as Giratina-O for more damage than Stone Edge, but it is weaker versus almost anything else, most notably Lugia. Calm Mind can be used on the specially based set over Toxic to pose an individual threat, but Arceus-Ground will still struggle heavily against Ho-Oh and other checks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Skarmory and Bronzong</strong>: Both of these Pokemon are immune to Arceus-Ground’s STAB moves, forcing it to rely on the weaker Stone Edge to hit them. However, because Bronzong resists Rock-type moves, Skarmory has stellar physical bulk, and Arceus-Ground's Stone Edge doesn't rank among the strongest of moves, they take little damage from it. Bronzong must be wary of Shadow Force, but the move is uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water can sufficiently deal with Arceus-Ground. Defensive Kyogre variants have the bulk to eat up a +2 Earthquake and OHKO with Scald. Offensive variants can check Arceus as long as it remains unboosted. Arceus-Water can hit Arceus-Ground with Judgment or Will-O-Wisp; however, Arceus-Ground can beat the most common Arceus-Water variant, which carries Toxic and Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Shaymin-S and Arceus-Grass have strong STAB moves to OHKO Arceus with. Shaymin-S outspeeds Arceus-Ground, whereas Arceus-Grass can take Stone Edges well. Both can switch in on Earthquake as well.</p> <p><strong>Giratina and Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O is immune to Earthquake and has good natural bulk, so it can phaze Arceus-Ground with Dragon Tail. Giratina, while uncommon, can do the same thanks to its stellar bulk, and it can burn Arceus-Ground as well. It can also use Rest to get rid of the damage, whereas Giratina-O cannot do so.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Deoxys-A, and Darkrai can effectively check Arceus-Ground thanks to their superior Speed stats. Mewtwo can launch a super effective Ice Beam, Deoxys-A has an even stronger Psycho Boost, and Darkrai can put it to sleep and proceed to use Nasty Plot or Dark Pulse. Extreme Speed can pick these Pokemon off before they can do so in return, but Mewtwo and Darkrai need to have already incurred a bit of chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Arceus-Ground despises burns because they effectively render it useless. A burned Arceus-Ground will fail to sweep anything, and it cannot effectively check the Pokemon it could before because of the residual damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance enables Arceus-Ground to sweep by giving it a +2 Attack boost under its belt. Earthquake gets the STAB bonus and is what Arceus-Ground uses to hit most targets, particularly Primal Groudon. Stone Edge hits most Pokemon that Earthquake doesn't, such as Flying-types and Levitate users. Recover might seem somewhat surprising on a set that is meant to sweep. It is used to give Arceus-Ground more longevity, which is very useful when switching in on Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and, most importantly, Primal Groudon. This way, Arceus-Ground can threaten out the opposing Pokemon when there isn't an opportunity to sweep, use Recover, and then make sure that it can do so later.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment is used because the point of this set is to sweep. Arceus-Ground needs the extra power to immediately threaten Primal Groudon, and it's also useful for dealing more damage to physically bulky Pokemon such as Lugia and physically defensive Yveltal. A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs let Arceus-Ground outspeed Latios, Latias, and non-Mega Gengar, as well as Speed tie with other fully invested Arceus formes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Ground is a very threatening mid- and late-game sweeper. Try to get it in on Pokemon it threatens out as often as possible so that you can create ample opportunity for it to set up. Examples include Steel-types such as Klefki and other Pokemon weak to Stone Edge. In practice, there are very few reliable checks to Arceus-Ground, so it's mostly a matter of creating opportunity. Recover combined with Arceus's natural bulk allows it to play very offensively, but make sure to keep it healthy if you want to reliably check Primal Groudon, as even an uninvested Precipice Blades can hurt. Arceus-Ground must be especially wary of switching in on Primal Groudon carrying Lava Plume, as a burned Arceus-Ground is effectively useless.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Arceus-Ground doesn't need a lot of team support; it's very deadly on its own. In fact, it supports the team by checking bothersome Steel-types and Primal Groudon when you need it to. A Pokemon that can absorb burns is much appreciated, as Arceus-Ground becomes almost useless when burned. Arceus-Ground is most threatening when your team has Pokemon that appreciate an offensive check to Primal Groudon, such as Fairy- and Steel-types, as well as Pokemon that suffer from opposing Steel-types. This way you can get Arceus-Ground in as often as possible. While Arceus-Ground does provide good offensive pressure, it needs a way to get around its checks and counters. Generally speaking, you will need an answer to bulky Primal Kyogre variants, support Arceus variants such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Grass, and fast revenge killers such as Darkrai and Shaymin-S. Latios, Latias, and Primal Groudon can take care of Primal Kyogre. Primal Groudon that carry a Fire-type move can dispose of Arceus-Grass, whereas Latios and Latias that carry Calm Mind beat both Arceus-Grass and Arceus-Water. Priority users such as Deoxys-A can beat problematic revenge killers. Healing Wish users such as Latias and Shaymin-S can heal a weakened Arceus-Ground, which it appreciates, as finding the time to use Recover can be a challenge.</p>"
      },
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Arceus-Ground can take a different route from the usual Swords Dance sets and utilize its Ground-type Judgment to become more of a support Arceus, similar to the likes of the standard Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon sets. Arceus-Ground has to forgo Defog to remain viable, however, as it has no room to fit Defog when its Judgment has a lot of dangerous switch-ins in Ubers, leaving a secondary attack such as Ice Beam necessary. Judgment hits Primal Groudon on its weaker Special Defense stat and does well against all Ground-weak Pokemon. Another bonus to Judgment is that Arceus-Ground does not need to fear burns as much from attacks such as Primal Groudon's Lava Plume and Mega Gengar's Will-O-Wisp. This gives this set more of a compressed role in a way to check most Primal Groudon sets, with only the more specially offensive set giving this Arceus-Ground set trouble. Ice Beam complements Judgment to an extent and keeps threats such as Mega Salamence and Rayquaza in check. It also hits most Pokemon with a Ground-type immunity such as Giratina-O, Latios, and Latias, but it falls short against Bronzong, Skarmory, and Ho-Oh. Latios and Latias tend to run recovery moves, however, and Ice Beam doesn't deal enough damage to keep them from switching in freely. Recover is a necessity to support Arceus to keep them healthy, and this set is no exception. Toxic puts a timer on many of this set's switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, and other support Arceus formes, but it doesn't help against Bronzong and Skarmory—that job belongs to its teammates. An alternative option is to swap out Ice Beam and Toxic in exchange for Stone Edge and Thunder Wave. This can prove to be much better at handling Ho-Oh switch-ins but can make the matchup against Mega Salamence and Lugia much more difficult. Thunder Wave provides an alternative way to cripple incoming Arceus-Ground checks, opting to slow them down for a teammate to easily check them, rather than attempting to Toxic stall them itself. Many Pokemon that are immune to Thunder Wave can have trouble taking on Arceus-Ground, which is a bonus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs give the best overall bulk, a necessity for support Arceus sets. 168 Speed EVs let Arceus-Ground outspeed positive-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Rayquaza and Kyurem-W. The remaining EVs go into Defense with a Bold nature to take on the numerous physical attackers in the tier more effectively.</p> <p>Some alternative EV spreads to consider involve using 124 Speed EVs in exchange for more Defense EVs. 124 Speed EVs let Arceus-Ground outspeed positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon instead. Arceus-Ground can go even slower with just 16 Speed EVs and the rest in Defense to fully maximize its bulk. 16 Speed EVs will still let it outspeed neutral-natured fully invested base 90 Speed Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Arceus-Ground set tends to play more or less like your standard support Arceus, meaning the ideal way to play it is to switch into physical threats that pose a threat to any member of the team. This set performs best against Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence and should be switched in without much fear. The immunity to Thunder Wave can prove very useful, as Primal Groudon will potentially try to catch an incoming check with Thunder Wave, giving Arceus-Ground a free switch. Watch out for a mixed Primal Groudon set, however, as Fire Blast from such a set can deal up to 75% of Arceus-Ground's HP, leaving it in a bad position. Keeping healthy with Recover is key to ensuring protection for your team against Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence. Aim to predict Pokemon such as Skarmory and Bronzong to switch in, as Arceus-Ground has very little chance to break past them. A good tactic is to switch Arceus-Ground into something it checks and then double switch out to a teammate such as Primal Kyogre to catch out incoming Arceus-Ground checks. Double switching can prove to be a useful tactic in general to prevent momentum loss against an offensive team. If Skarmory and Bronzong are not on the opposing team but Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Latios are, aim to hit them with Toxic on the switch to cripple them. This means that they cannot switch in repeatedly and will lose to attrition in the long run.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special Arceus-Ground sets require a rather specific set of teammates in order to avoid being outclassed by other support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Dragon and Arceus-Water. As a result, this set doesn't fit the typical balance teams of the current metagame that build around Ho-Oh, as the lack of Fire- and Water-type resistances from Arceus-Ground can leave too many gaps in a build that can be exploited by dangerous threats such as Primal Kyogre and opposing Ho-Oh. This set tends to best fit a \"bulky offense\" style of team, a team archetype that uses Pokemon with a mix of bulk and power alongside entry hazards to break teams down in a slower and more methodical manner than a hyper offensive playstyle. The lack of Defog also means that Arceus-Ground's teammates are better off using their own entry hazards and forcing the enemy to remove the entry hazards, or else they risk losing a war of attrition. An ideal teammate is Primal Kyogre, as it provides backup support against most of Arceus-Ground's checks and also helps against mixed Primal Groudon, while Arceus-Ground takes care of all other Primal Groudon sets, something that Primal Kyogre appreciates. Another teammate that suits this style of team is Mega Gengar, a Pokemon that can trap and remove annoyances from the enemy team. Primal Groudon can also fit this team well, taking care of opposing Primal Kyogre, being able to set Stealth Rock, and providing a soft check to Ho-Oh. Xerneas enjoys the security that Arceus-Ground brings against Primal Groudon, potentially opening it up to a sweep later in the match. Priority users such as Rayquaza and Deoxys-A are welcome teammates due to both of them being good wallbreakers in their own right while also providing some security against opposing Geomancy Xerneas, courtesy of their access to Extreme Speed. Spikes setters such as Klefki and Ferrothorn are good considerations, with each bringing their own niche to a team alongside their Spikes. Klefki is great against Darkrai, Latios, and Xerneas, while Ferrothorn works well against Latios too and also covers Primal Kyogre and opposing support Arceus formes.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With a lack of Ice-resistant Pokemon in Ubers, Arceus-Ice has the ability to wreak havoc to unprepared teams thanks to its access to Ice-type STAB moves, which is rare, as well as excellent coverage in Thunder and Fire Blast. Its Ice typing causes many problems, however, such as a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock and no notable resistances, making Arceus-Ice difficult to fit into a team, especially when an Arceus forme is typically chosen to cover up weaknesses in a team. However, the return of viable Defog users in Latios and Latias help with the Stealth Rock issue, and having an Arceus forme that can deal with Mega Salamence, a huge threat, is useful for some offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Ice doesn't have many other viable options. Ancient Power could be used to 2HKO Ho-Oh without any boosts or Special Attack investment, but is usually not worth the trade off unless you absolutely need ways to get around Ho-Oh. Refresh is a way to deal with status, but the subsequent lack of coverage leaves Arceus-Ice walled by a lot of Pokemon and is not typically worth bothering with.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh is able to switch in and OHKO Arceus-Ice with Sacred Fire with great ease. A +1 Thunder can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While not all Steel-types common in Ubers resist Ice, they all have the bulk to take Judgment and heavily damage Arceus-Ice with their STAB attacks. Some Steel-types, such as Klefki, Mega Scizor, and Aegislash, are hard to beat without Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water resist Judgment and can win Calm Mind wars due to Arceus-Ice not resisting Water.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types are large threats to Arceus-Ice; Primal Groudon is neutral to Ice and is commonly seen with a Fire-type STAB move or Rock-type coverage move, making it difficult for Arceus-Ice to beat it. Mega Blaziken can also switch into Arceus-Ice and OHKO it with its STAB moves. Arceus-Fire can also deal with Arceus-Ice easily thanks to its resistance to Ice.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Lucario, and Mega Blaziken can switch into Judgment, Thunder, and Fire Blast, and OHKO Arceus-Ice with their Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Arceus-Rock do not resist Ice, they can switch in and easily KO Arceus-Ice with their STAB moves.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Arceus-Ice to threaten the opposing team and maintaining offensive presence with the boosted Special Attack while also being able to survive many special moves thanks to the boosted Special Defense. Judgment is the most reliable and powerful Ice-type STAB move Arceus-Ice has access to; due to a lack of Ice-resistant Pokemon in the tier, it is very spammable. Recover gives Arceus-Ice the longevity it needs to consistently check threats or accumulate enough Calm Mind boosts to potentially sweep teams. Thunder is the coverage move of choice, preventing Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water from checking Arceus-Ice while also hitting Ho-Oh super effectively. Fire Blast is an alternative that can be used to OHKO Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor and heavily damage Klefki and Aegislash. Ice Beam can be used over Judgment, giving up some power for a chance to freeze the foe, which can prove useful in a Calm Mind war.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs give Arceus-Ice the bulk it needs to check Mega Salamence and Rayquaza while minimizing Stealth Rock damage at the same time. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Arceus-Ice to, at worst, tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack; however, relinquishing the HP EVs to maximize Special Attack is an option to allow Arceus-Ice to 2HKO Ho-Oh with a +1 Thunder, something that cannot be done with 8 Special Attack EVs.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Ice's Judgment is very potent in ORAS Ubers, and it should be used whenever it can be used. Be very careful when switching Arceus-Ice in, however, as its poor defensive typing and weakness to Stealth Rock can make it KOed more easily. Switching Arceus-Ice in to revenge kill a foe is a great way to avoid damage and get it in safely. Try to weaken possible checks to Arceus-Ice such as Ho-Oh before revealing it, or your opponent might try to preserve them to stop it. Arceus-Ice works best as a late-game cleaner with Calm Mind and Judgment, but can also be used early-game to revenge kill Dragon-types if necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog is absolutely necessary when using Arceus-Ice to remove entry hazards, as Stealth Rock will remove 25% of Arceus-Ice's health upon every switch in if it is not removed; Arceus-Ice is also very weak to Toxic Spikes. Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O are good options for Defog users. Stealth Rock setters, such are Dialga, Primal Groudon and Mega Diancie, are appreciated to punish Ho-Oh switch-ins and chip at other enemy Pokemon, allowing Arceus-Ice to clean up later. Primal Groudon is a great teammate due to its resistances to Fire and Steel, ability to set Stealth Rock up, and its ability to check Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Aegislash, and Klefki, all of which are huge threats to Arceus-Ice.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its typing, Arceus-Poison is able to counter Lugia and most defensive Arceus formes if carrying Recover, something few offensive Arceus formes can do. It is also one of the few Xerneas counters, as it can take any +2 hit and KO it back with a combination of Poison Jab and Extreme Speed after a bit of prior damage. With Poison Jab's 30% chance to poison the foe, it can be used to fish for status early- and mid-game, and once Arceus-Poison's checks and counters have been weakened, it becomes a deadly late-game sweeper. However, it can be difficult to justify on teams due to lack of immediate power and a crippling Ground weakness, making it vulnerable to the most common Pokemon in the metagame, Primal Groudon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive utility set with Ice Beam over Swords Dance is an option to hit Giratina-O and Mega Salamence harder, OHKOing the latter. If this is chosen, Extreme Speed should be used in the fourth moveslot. A Calm Mind set can be utilized due to Arceus-Poison's decent coverage and immunity to Toxic. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is an option to outpace Latios, Latias, and Mega Diancie and Speed tie with opposing Swords Dance Arceus formes, although Arceus-Poison will lose to nearly all of them one-on-one.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Healthy Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground can both easily counter Arceus-Poison by virtue of their typing.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: If not in range of Extreme Speed, Darkrai and Mewtwo can check Arceus-Poison with Dark Void and Psystrike, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Klefki can take an unboosted Earthquake and cripple Arceus-Poison with priority Thunder Wave, while Ferrothorn is difficult to break if not running Recover. Bronzong and Skarmory both completely wall Arceus-Poison.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Giratina-O takes extremely little from non-Ice Beam Arceus-Poison and can cripple or phaze it, and Mega Sableye can cripple Arceus-Poison with Will-O-Wisp and threaten its setup with Foul Play, using its boosts against it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Arceus-Poison's Attack to impressive levels, allowing it to OHKO or 2HKO most Pokemon that don't resist its attacks. Poison Jab is the STAB move of choice, with a useful 30% chance to poison the foe. Earthquake nabs coverage on the Steel-types that are immune to Poison Jab, such as Klefki and Aegislash, and is this set's best option to hit Primal Groudon. Recover is the preferred move for the fourth slot and can be used to continuously switch into Xerneas early- or mid-game, heal off residual damage from entry hazards, and use most bulky Arceus formes as setup fodder. Alternatively, Extreme Speed can be used to pick off faster threats, such as Deoxys-A and weakened Darkrai.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Arceus-Poison to hit as hard as possible. The Speed investment allows Arceus-Poison to outspeed everything up to Modest Latios. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to avoid the OHKO from +1 Mega Salamence's Return and +2 Life Orb Darkrai's Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock. Toxic Plate is the default item to determine the Arceus forme.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Arceus-Poison in on resisted attacks, such as Xerneas's Moonblast, to set up with Swords Dance or fish for status with Poison Jab. If carrying Recover, Arceus-Poison can switch in liberally on support Arceus formes and use them as setup fodder. However, this set still lets Giratina-O switch in easily, so if you wish to preserve entry hazards, double switch around to maintain the pressure on it. Aim to set up late-game after Arceus-Poison's checks and counters have been weakened, as Earthquake can pick off a weakened Primal Groudon and Extreme Speed can achieve KOs on weakened Mewtwo and Darkrai. Keep Arceus-Poison away from status, as burns make this set offensively useless and paralysis allows Primal Groudon to easily revenge KO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Toxic Spikes removed, such as Primal Groudon, make for good partners. Primal Groudon is also able to provide entry hazard support and absorb Will-O-Wisp and priority Thunder Wave, both of which hinder Arceus-Poison's sweeping potential. Pokemon that can deal with its common checks, such as Life Orb Yveltal and Xerneas, work well with it. Dialga can counter Mega Salamence, which checks non-Ice Beam Arceus-Poison. Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, and bulky Yveltal can deal with the Ground-types that threaten Arceus-Poison, and the latter can also check the Psychic-types that hit it super effectively.</p>"

  "Arceus-Psychic": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Psychic is a Pokemon that gives off the impression that it can be a check to the multitude of Psychic-types in the tier with its great bulk and mono-Psychic typing. This is actually very far from the truth. Arceus-Psychic can't actually deal any significant damage to Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo due to its lack of power, and as such, it is left to try to Toxic stall them out. This is all provided that they don't have Calm Mind, or Taunt in Mewtwo's case, which just stops Arceus-Psychic cold. Arceus-Psychic can't even viably run a STAB move, as this hinders the already useless abilities that it might be able to do. As such, Arceus-Psychic's best option is to take advantage of the fact its Psychic typing is harder to exploit with physical attacks, with only Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O able to significantly threaten it, and become a general physical wall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Calm Mind set with a combination of Psyshock and Fire Blast or Focus Blast can work, but it runs into trouble when facing the very same Psychic-type Pokemon that it is supposed to check, as Calm Mind Latios and Latias can beat such a set in a one-on-one scenario. Judgment can be used for a powerful STAB move, but a STAB move is actually useless to Arceus-Psychic's role as a check to Psychic-types, and as such it does not typically run one. Magic Coat can bounce back entry hazards and status moves that could otherwise be used against Arceus-Psychic without consequence. Focus Blast can be used to hit incoming Dark-type Pokemon, preventing them coming in for free. Defog is an option, but Arceus-Psychic has trouble effectively using the move. Thunder Wave can stop fast Pokemon such as Mewtwo and other Arceus formes, but Arceus-Psychic has trouble fitting it on its moveset, and using Thunder Wave over Toxic will leave Arceus-Psychic helpless against Primal Groudon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Most Ubers Pokemon</strong>: The important thing to note here is that Arceus-Psychic is generally ineffective against the majority of the entire tier, and it has to resort to Toxic stalling if it cannot hit a Pokemon with a super effective Ice Beam, Payback, or Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon such as Yveltal and Tyranitar can switch into Arceus-Psychic and threaten to OHKO it. Arceus-Psychic is completely helpless against Dark-types, and it can only attempt to hit them with Toxic on the switch before being immediately forced out.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Dialga and Klefki can usually switch into Arceus-Psychic without any fear and force it out. Fire Blast does considerable damage to most of them, however.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O can switch into Arceus-Psychic and immediately force it out with their STAB moves. Hitting them with Toxic or Payback is Arceus-Psychic's only way to effectively damage them.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre can switch into Arceus-Psychic and threaten to sweep with Calm Mind or deal heavy damage to Arceus-Psychic with Origin Pulse. Asides from Toxic, there isn't much Arceus-Psychic can do against Primal Kyogre.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable can switch into Arceus-Psychic without any fears at all. It can use Heal Bell to stop any attempts at Toxic stalling it or its teammates, or it can just set up Calm Mind boosts in Arceus-Psychic's face and sweep.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas can switch into Arceus-Psychic and use Geomancy with only the fear of Toxic to stop it. Defensive variants of Xerneas just laugh at Arceus-Psychic, as they can use Aromatherapy to heal any Pokemon that Arceus-Psychic might have attempted to Toxic stall.</p>",

      "General Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast prevents Arceus-Psychic from giving Steel-types free switch-ins. Payback is typically better when used with Special Defense investment, as it can actually let Arceus-Psychic beat Psychic-types, and should be used over Fire Blast in this case. Ice Beam allows Arceus-Psychic to check Rayquaza, Mega Salamence, and other Dragon-types, but it should be noted that it will not OHKO these Pokemon unless they have taken some prior damage. Toxic is unfortunately Arceus-Psychic's main way of dealing damage to the majority of the Pokemon in the metagame and lets it \"check\" Psychic-types. Recover is necessary for a wall to stay healthy, and it allows Arceus-Psychic to stall long enough for Toxic to rack up damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP EVs and 200 Defense EVs with a Bold nature allow Arceus-Psychic to try taking on the physical attackers of the tier, namely Rayquaza and Mega Salamence. 56 Speed EVs allow Arceus-Psychic to outspeed everything up to Adamant Rayquaza. A specially defensive set provides a better check to Psychic-types such as Latias and Mewtwo, but it has harder matchups against anything other than those specific Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Psychic is ultimately a very bad choice for any serious team, and reconsideration is advised before using it. Its best role is attempting to check Psychic-types by Toxic stalling or checking physical threats. If using Payback with Special Defense investment, switch into any Psychic-types you see and force them out, or 2HKO the majority of them with Payback. Switch into physical threats such as Rayquaza and Salamence and KO them with Ice Beam, but be wary when switching in; very powerful attacks such as Dragon Ascent from Rayquaza, Double-Edge from Mega Salamence, and Bolt Strike from Zekrom will 2HKO Arceus-Psychic, even with all that Defense investment. Dark-type Pokemon should be avoided at all costs, as Arceus-Psychic is helpless against them other than hitting them with Toxic on the switch. Be wary of Arceus-Psychic getting hit with Toxic from lures such as support Primal Groudon and Klefki, as this severely hinders its ability to check physical threats. Arceus-Psychic also has a tendency to just sit there and invite in multiple sweepers such as Primal Kyogre, and as such, avoid staying in for any longer than 2-3 turns unless absolutely necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Arceus-Psychic is completely helpless against Dark-type Pokemon such as Yveltal, so answers to them such as Xerneas and Mega Diancie are absolutely necessary to support Arceus-Psychic. Checks to Steel-types such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre make for effective partners to prevent them from walking all over Arceus-Psychic, as Fire Blast can only do average damage to them. Primal Kyogre checks such as Latias, Latios, and Primal Groudon also make for good teammates, as it can switch into Arceus-Psychic and threaten to sweep with Calm Mind. Ghost-types such as Arceus-Ghost, Mega Gengar, and Giratina-O are also very threatening to Arceus-Psychic, and checks such as Yveltal, Tyranitar, and Ho-Oh can be effective teammates. Defog users such as Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O can also clear entry hazards that will otherwise limit Arceus-Psychic's ability to check things.</p>"

  "Arceus-Rock": {
    "overview": "<p>A Rock typing allows Arceus-Rock to carve out a niche in the Ubers tier as one of the most solid switch-ins to Ho-Oh available. In addition, this typing grants Arceus-Rock the capability to check some other relevant threats such as Yveltal, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza. Rock is an offensive type that is quite solid and is not hampered by type immunities, while on the defensive end it has both key resistances to Flying- and Normal-types. All Arceus formes have bulky defensive stats thanks to base 120 HP, Defense, and Special Defense, as well as access to an effective support movepool in the form of instant recovery, status, and Defog. The metagame's loss of focus on Kyogre and Palkia when compared to XY helped Arceus-Rock's viability significantly, as they greatly threaten any set. Despite the useful resistances given by pure Rock typing, however, it has exploitable weaknesses to common Ground- and Steel-types. Furthermore, the increased use of Ground-type coverage moves in ORAS negatively impacts Arceus-Rock, with Pokemon such as Rayquaza now running Earthquake. Although the Calm Mind set rectifies Arceus-Rock's lack of offensive presence to an extent, it is still a passive Pokemon that can be destroyed by some stallbreakers and users of Shadow Tag. Lastly, there is an inherent opportunity cost associated with using an Arceus forme, as it means that your team cannot run a potentially better Arceus.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is an option, especially on the Calm Mind set, to allow Arceus-Rock to avoid being hit by status. Similarly, Refresh can be used to remove status rather than block it. Toxic can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp on the support set to punish support Arceus much harder, although it prevents Arceus-Rock from being able to neuter physical Ground- and Steel-type Pokemon. Thunder Wave is a status option that can nail fast switch-ins and setup sweepers; however, Will-O-Wisp is typically better to allow Arceus-Rock to halt several physical attackers. Stealth Rock is a great option for Pokemon that cause Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal to switch out; however, Arceus-Rock struggles to find room for it. Grass Knot is a coverage move that can be employed on the Calm Mind set to hit Water- and Ground-types, although it still struggles against Steel-types and Palkia. Fire Blast is another coverage option for the Calm Mind set to hit Steel-types, although Will-O-Wisp appropriately punishes most Steel-types already while retaining more utility. Earth Power can hit some Steel-types in addition to Primal Groudon; however, for the same reasons as the other coverage moves, Will-O-Wisp is typically better.</p> <p>Magic Coat is an interesting option to bounce back Toxic, Taunt, and even entry hazards, although it is a niche move reliant on good prediction. Perish Song puts a timer on setup sweepers and can force a trade with Gothitelle, but it is a difficult move to fit on the support set. Roar can also be used to stop setup sweepers and Gothitelle; however, the utility of the standard moves on the support set is generally better. Arceus-Rock does have the capability to set up Tailwind, which can be an interesting method of support for appropriate teams able to reap the benefit, but generally this is not worth the move slot. Psych Up can allow Arceus-Rock to copy opposing stat boosts, but most of the time these aren't very beneficial. Lastly, Arceus-Rock can potentially run a Swords Dance set; however, it must rely on Stone Edge for a physical STAB move and its typing does not particularly allow it to circumvent a large number of typical Swords Dance Arceus checks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Kyogre and Palkia</strong>: Both Kyogre and Palkia have a large Special Defense that can shrug off Arceus-Rock’s Judgment. In return, their massive Special Attack, combined with a type advantage, blows right through Arceus-Rock. Being special attackers, these Pokemon do not mind being burned much either, and common use of Rest means that the cumulative damage from Judgments and burns is not an issue.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar and Gothitelle</strong>: Both Mega Gengar and Gothitelle have the ability Shadow Tag, which reduces the battle to a one-on-one. This is an issue because both of these threats have the ability to beat Arceus-Rock one-on-one; Mega Gengar has access to Taunt, Destiny Bond, or even Focus Blast while Gothitelle has access to Calm Mind, Rest, and Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Dialga</strong>: Dialga resists Arceus-Rock's Judgment and can retaliate with Toxic or Flash Cannon. Specially defensive sets can Toxic and / or Roar out Calm Mind Arceus-Rock.</p> <p><strong>Arceus With a Type Advantage</strong>: Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, Arceus-Grass, Arceus-Steel, and Arceus-Fighting can all threaten Arceus-Rock because they have an inherent typing advantage.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon is immune to Will-O-Wisp and can threaten Arceus-Rock, as it can OHKO Arceus-Rock through powerful Ground-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Mega Blaziken</strong>: While Mega Blaziken takes significant damage from Judgment, it is faster than Arceus-Rock and deals high damage with 120 Base Power Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mega Mewtwo X dislikes burns but can otherwise crush Arceus-Rock with its Fighting-type moves. Mega Mewtwo Y can break down Arceus-Rock with Taunt, Recover, and Psystrike due to its high Speed and Special Defense stats. More offensive Mewtwo sets can also threaten Arceus-Rock with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Clefable and Blissey</strong>: Both Clefable and Blissey have massive special bulk that let them comfortably tank Judgment; they also do not mind being burned. In return, they can Toxic Arceus-Rock, and Clefable might be running Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: While it doesn't like being burned, Ferrothorn can Toxic Arceus-Rock, assuming it runs the move. Ferrothorn that lack Toxic can force a stalemate through Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Excadrill, Genesect, Mega Metagross, and Mega Lucario cannot afford to switch into Will-O-Wisp, but can potentially revenge kill Arceus-Rock, as they are either faster or have access to priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Shaymin-S</strong>: Shaymin-S cannot directly switch into Arceus-Rock because of the threat of Judgment; however, it can OHKO Arceus-Rock with Seed Flare.</p>",

      "Bird Antidote": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock typing, along with solid base 120 HP, Defense, and Special Defense, allows Arceus-Rock to function as a user of Defog. This is reinforced by its base 120 Speed, which makes it difficult to Taunt. Will-O-Wisp is used to burn the Steel- and Ground-types that typically come in against Arceus-Rock, and also allows it to neuter Extreme Killer Arceus. Recover gives Arceus-Rock the ability to last for the duration of a match, which is important for ensuring that your side remains free of entry hazards. Judgment is Arceus-Rock's best attacking move for this set, allowing it to OHKO Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Mega Salamence while taking advantage of Arceus-Rock's STAB type and the 1.2x damage bonus from Stone Plate. Stealth Rock is an optional move over Defog for teams that want to free up a Primal Groudon set, as Arceus-Rock can come in, force out a Pokemon weak to Rock, and set up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Stone Plate is necessary to determine Arceus's type and further boosts the power of Judgment. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Rock to outspeed a large chunk of the Ubers tier and Speed tie with other maximum Speed Arceus and Mega Salamence. Maximum HP EVs help Arceus-Rock stomach powerful attacks from the Pokemon it intends to check, such as avoiding the OHKO from +1 Mega Salamence's Earthquake. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe with a Timid nature gives up some Speed to be more physically bulky, while still beating maximum base 100 Speed Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In general, support Arceus formes dislike burns and poison, as the passive damage forces increased use of Recover; Pokemon immune to either of these statuses can be used to pivot from Arceus-Rock. One of the main draws of using Arceus-Rock, however, is the fact that it is a Ho-Oh check, which inevitably leads to burns from Sacred Fire. When burned, Arceus-Rock can still escape the 2HKO from any of Ho-Oh's moves other than a Choice Banded Earthquake, and it can function as a status sponge until a time when it is advantageous for a cleric to remove the burn. A standard Choice Banded Ho-Oh Earthquake deals a minimum of 68%, meaning that switching Arceus-Rock into a Choice Band Ho-Oh at this percent or less can mean that it will be KOed. Even though Choice Band Ho-Oh 2HKOes Arceus-Rock with Earthquake, this is not an issue so long as Arceus-Rock is above this percentage, because it is faster than Ho-Oh and can OHKO it with Judgment.</p> <p>Arceus-Rock can also switch into Yveltal granted it is not at a low HP percentage; however, the user of Arceus-Rock must be wary of Yveltal that U-turn into Mega Gengar. This set can punish several common types of switch-ins; Will-O-Wisp can neuter physical Steel- and Ground-types that may be tempted to switch in, while Judgment can deal respectable damage, whittling down Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, offensive Kyogre, and Mega Blaziken. Even though Arceus-Rock resists Extreme Speed, has Will-O-Wisp, and Speed ties with standard Extreme Killer Arceus, it is a very shaky check, as Extreme Killer Arceus typically runs Earthquake, which OHKOes Arceus-Rock at +2. Lastly, when using any Arceus forme, it is often advantageous to keep the type hidden from your opponent.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is a great partner for Arceus-Rock due to its ability to check several threats such as Kyogre, Palkia, Dialga, Clefable, and Blissey. Both Latias and Latios are great checks to Kyogre, Palkia, and Primal Groudon and benefit from Arceus-Rock's ability to check Yveltal. Mewtwo can offensively threaten several checks to Arceus-Rock and break several passive checks to Arceus-Rock such as Clefable and Blissey. A Pursuit trapper such as Mega Scizor appreciates Arceus-Rock checking Ho-Oh and can be used to trap Mega Gengar and Gothitelle. Xerneas can function as a cleric to remove Sacred Fire burns from Arceus-Rock and serves as a check to Palkia. Arceus-Rock appreciates cleric support in general because of its dislike for Toxic and frequent burns from Sacred Fire; Clefable and Blissey can both provide this support while checking Palkia.</p> <p>Despite creating a stacked Ground weakness, Dialga can set up Stealth Rock, which places further pressure on Ho-Oh when paired with Arceus-Rock; Dialga can also check Calm Mind Arceus, Clefable, and Ferrothorn. Lugia greatly appreciates Arceus-Rock checking Yveltal; in return, it checks Primal Groudon and offers a Ground immunity. Similarly, Giratina-O benefits from the check to Yveltal while providing a Ground immunity and check to Primal Groudon. Mega Sableye can provide a more solid check to Extreme Killer Arceus while also being able to check Mewtwo and deflect Toxic and Taunt for Arceus-Rock. Kyogre can be used to wash away Ground-types that threaten Arceus-Rock and benefits from entry hazard removal, although it does stack a weakness to some checks such as Palkia and Ferrothorn. Zekrom can outright destroy Kyogre and threaten Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Mega Gengar, while Steel-types benefit from Arceus-Rock's check to Ho-Oh. Lastly, Shaymin-S can offensively check several of Arceus-Rock's checks such as Kyogre and Ground-types, while benefiting from Arceus-Rock's check to Ho-Oh.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind helps give Arceus-Rock more of an offensive presence. While Arceus-Rock still loses to several common Pokemon employed on stall teams, Rock is an offensive type that nothing is immune to, making it a solid choice as a user of Calm Mind. Will-O-Wisp neuters some Ground- and Steel-types that might attempt to break Arceus-Rock as types are typically physical attackers. Recover not only gives Arceus-Rock staying potential, but assists its endeavors to set up Calm Mind. Judgment is the most powerful special attack available to Arceus-Rock; Rock is generally effective as an offensive typing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Stone Plate is mandatory or Arceus isn't Arceus-Rock; it also makes Judgment hit a bit harder. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Rock to beat relevant Pokemon with base 110 Speed and tie with opposing maximum Speed Arceus and Mega Salamence. Maximum HP EVs are used to increase Arceus-Rock's overall bulk, making it easier to set up Calm Mind and tank special attacks once set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind Arceus-Rock plays differently from other Calm Mind Arceus such as Arceus-Dark. This set is used to pivot into Pokemon that Arceus-Rock can check such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Mega Kangaskhan. From there, depending on what your opponent has, the set can be played offensively or defensively; offensively if your opponent's Calm Mind Arceus check is damaged or KOed, defensively if your opponent still has a healthy switch-in available. Because this set lacks the raw power or ability to circumvent some types of passive Pokemon, it is pointless to set up Calm Mind until these are removed or damaged enough to where you can blow through them.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp is primarily used to prevent physical Ground- and Steel-types from being able to break you, so don't always switch out just because one of these types of threats comes in. Will-O-Wisp also has the utility to punish Pokemon that come in due to how Arceus-Rock causes switches, so choose to Will-O-Wisp or attack with Judgment based on what you think your opponent will bring in. Status conditions, especially poison and burns, are a great threat to Calm Mind Arceus that lack Refresh or Substitute, so keep Arceus-Rock away from these through use of status absorbers and / or cleric support. Never become too greedy with the use of Calm Mind; carefully boost only as necessary to break what you need to and Recover frequently so a surprise critical hit doesn't ruin what should have been a victory.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is an excellent offensive choice that can break through many of Calm Mind Arceus-Rock's checks such as Kyogre, Palkia, Dialga, Clefable, and Blissey. Latias and Latios can function as Defog support for a team while serving as checks to Kyogre and Palkia because this set forgoes running Defog; Latios and Latias further benefit from Arceus-Rock's check to Yveltal. Xerneas is a great cleric option to keep Calm Mind Arceus-Rock free of status; it can also break Palkia and appreciates the check to Ho-Oh. Mewtwo can shatter a wide variety of defensive checks to Calm Mind Arceus-Rock and can even outspeed Gengar before it Mega Evolves, while Arceus-Rock takes care of Yveltal.</p> <p>Dialga with appropriate coverage can beat Clefable and Ferrothorn, which are two common and effective checks to Calm Mind Arceus and Palkia. With its powerful Water-type moves, Kyogre can destroy the Ground-types that frequently threaten Arceus-Rock. Zekrom is an offensive Pokemon that can threaten Kyogre and Mega Gengar for Arceus-Rock while Giratina-O adds a handy immunity to Ground-type moves, benefits from the check to Yveltal, and can be used to fit Defog on the team. Most Steel-types greatly appreciate having a solid switch-in to Ho-Oh, as does Shaymin-S; Shaymin-S can also offensively check Kyogre and Ground-types. Lastly, anti-status support such as Mega Sableye can be helpful for deflecting Taunt and Toxic, while a cleric can remove status entirely.</p>"

  "Arceus-Steel": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Steel has a unique mono-Steel typing that offers it ten resistances and an immunity, allowing it to fill a number of roles. Great 120 / 120 / 120 bulk along with a useful typing gives Arceus-Steel solid defensive utility in checking Latias, Latios, and some variants of Xerneas. Additionally, Arceus-Steel's immunity to Toxic gives it good stallbreaking ability, and Arceus-Steel can run both Calm Mind and Swords Dance sets effectively; unfortunately, Steel is a subpar offensive typing. Furthermore, Arceus-Steel has relatively exploitable weaknesses to common Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type coverage moves. The dominating presence of Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh in Ubers also limits Arceus-Steel's effectiveness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Steel can run a viable support set with status moves and Defog. Will-O-Wisp can burn physical threats such as Mega Salamence and Swords Dance Arceus. Thunder Wave cripples fast threats such as Mewtwo and Xerneas, allowing Arceus-Steel to better check these Pokemon. Toxic wears down Primal Groudon and also puts a timer on Latias, Latios, and Defog Arceus formes. Finally, Roar can be used to phaze setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas, Mega Salamence, and Swords Dance Arceus formes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types all resist Steel and can threaten Arceus-Steel with a super effective STAB move. Primal Groudon switches in relatively easy and threatens Arceus-Steel with both of its STAB moves; however, it is worn down easily to a point where Arceus-Steel can beat it with Earth Power or Earthquake. Ho-Oh also easily switches in and threatens Arceus-Steel with Sacred Fire, though it must be wary of Stone Edge and Thunder. Reshiram also threatens Arceus-Steel with its Fire STAB moves, though Earth Power, Earthquake, and Stone Edge all hit it super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While Ground-types do not resist Steel, they can still switch in and threaten Arceus-Steel with a STAB move. Primal Groudon threatens Arceus-Steel with both its Ground and Fire STAB moves, while resisting Judgment and Iron Head as well. Arceus-Ground has great bulk that enables it to switch in and threaten Arceus-Steel with Judgment or Earthquake, and it can also set up with Calm Mind and Swords Dance. Excadrill fears Earthquake and Earth Power, but it resists Steel and threatens Arceus-Steel with a super effective Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types check Arceus-Steel thanks to their resistance to Steel. Primal Kyogre switches in easily and can hit Arceus-Steel with a powerful Origin Pulse, paralyze it with Thunder Wave, phaze it with Roar, or set up its own Calm Mind boosts. Arceus-Water walls Arceus-Steel relatively well, though it struggles to do much in return; Calm Mind Arceus-Steel can set up multiple boosts to overwhelm Arceus-Water, while Arceus-Water must carry Judgment to beat Swords Dance variants assuming that they both lack Recover. Both Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water do not like taking Thunder from Calm Mind Arceus-Steel.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types pose a direct threat to Arceus-Steel and can force it out. Arceus-Fighting has great bulk that allows it to switch in and hit Arceus-Steel with Thunder Wave and Judgment. Mega Mewtwo X threatens to OHKO Arceus-Steel with Low Kick, though it cannot switch in repeatedly. Mega Lucario also threatens to OHKO Arceus-Steel with Close Combat, while Mega Blaziken threatens to OHKO Arceus-Steel with Low Kick; however, both of the last two fear Earthquake and Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory's typing allows it to check Arceus-Steel very effectively. Skarmory fears nothing from Swords Dance Arceus-Steel, and it can simply set Spikes and use Whirlwind to phaze Arceus-Steel if it gains too many boosts. Against Calm Mind Arceus-Steel, Skarmory can use Whirlwind to phaze it but must be wary of Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O checks Swords Dance Arceus-Steel by virtue of its good physical bulk and can proceed to burn it with Will-O-Wisp or phaze it with Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast Pokemon that outspeed and KO Arceus-Steel can revenge KO it. Deoxys-A outspeeds Arceus-Steel and can hit it with a Life Orb-boosted, super effective Low Kick or Superpower. Mewtwo can outspeed and, depending on its set, hit Arceus-Steel with Focus Blast, Fire Blast, or Low Kick. Darkrai outspeeds Arceus-Steel and can put it to sleep with Dark Void, and then can set up Nasty Plot or KO Arceus-Steel by repeatedly using Dark Pulse.</p>",

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Arceus-Steel to set up and break stall in conjunction with its Toxic immunity. Judgment is Arceus-Steel's primary STAB move that hits Fairy-types super effectively, though its overall coverage is mediocre. Recover lets Arceus-Steel take repeated attacks and residual damage and also set up multiple Calm Minds. Earth Power provides coverage to hit Primal Groudon and Steel-types super effectively. Thunder similarly provides coverage for Arceus-Steel, but it instead targets Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Arceus-Steel's mixed bulk, which works well with Arceus-Steel's natural bulk and useful typing to allow for more setup opportunities. 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Steel to outspeed Pokemon with base 110 Speed that run maximum Speed, such as Latias, Latios, and Gengar before it Mega Evolves. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to help against physical attackers such as Mega Salamence and Extreme Killer Arceus. Alternately, 252 Speed EVs can be used to at worst Speed tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Steel should function as a support Pokemon that checks Dragon- and Fairy-types early on as needed and also has the ability to set up and break stall or clean later on. However, setting up while the opponent has strong checks in the back tends to be inefficient, because Arceus-Steel will simply be phazed or threatened out by strong checks such as Ho-Oh. It should be noted that Arceus-Steel should not be relied on as a Geomancy Xerneas check, as Xerneas commonly carries Focus Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Arceus-Steel appreciates partners that check the Pokemon that threaten it. Giratina-O is a good teammate for Arceus-Steel, because it checks Primal Groudon and Fighting-types that threaten Arceus-Steel while also providing Defog support for a team; Giratina-O also appreciates Arceus-Steel's ability to check Fairy-types and Dragon-types. Other Primal Groudon checks, such as Latias, Latios, Mega Salamence, and Lugia, make for good partners. Other checks to Fighting-types, such as Xerneas, Mega Salamence, and Lugia, also make for good partners. Ho-Oh checks are important partners, so Mega Diancie, Mega Salamence, and Tyranitar all complement Arceus-Steel well in that regard; strong Stealth Rock support is also useful because it weakens Ho-Oh. Finally, Primal Kyogre checks such as Primal Groudon, Latias, and Latios are good teammates for Arceus-Steel.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance makes Arceus-Steel a strong setup sweeper that hits hard physically. Iron Head is very reliable, and as such it is Arceus-Steel's best physical STAB move. Earthquake provides coverage to hit Primal Groudon and most Steel-types super effectively. For the last moveslot, Arceus-Steel has a number of options. Stone Edge targets most Flying-types, though it most notably hits Ho-Oh and prevents Arceus-Steel from being walled by it. Extreme Speed picks off weakened threats; however, it is relatively weak if Arceus-Steel does not have any Attack boosts. Recover keeps Arceus-Steel healthy and lets it set up more consistently while also being worn down less easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swords Dance Arceus-Steel's main niche is being an offensive Swords Dance sweeper that has the bulk and typing to check threats such as Latias, Latios, and Xerneas decently well. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature guarantee that Arceus-Steel can outspeed the many Pokemon that have a base Speed between 90 and 110, and that it can at least Speed tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence. 252 Attack EVs maximize Arceus-Steel's otherwise mediocre offensive capabilities. The remaining EVs are placed in Defense to give Arceus-Steel an odd HP value to reduce passive damage while still giving Genesect a Special Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Arceus-Steel should be used as a switch into Dragon- and Fairy-types, hopefully wearing down its checks as they switch in. Later on, it should set up and attempt to sweep the opposing team. Arceus-Steel can use its immunity to Poison to switch in and absorb Toxic for its teammates; however, Arceus-Steel will be severely crippled and worn down by burns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support is important, because it limits Ho-Oh's opportunities to switch in, and it also deals residual damage that weakens Arceus-Steel's checks. Ho-Oh checks such as Mega Diancie, Mega Salamence, and Tyranitar; Primal Groudon checks such as Latias, Latios, Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, and Lugia; checks to Fighting-types such as Xerneas, Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, and Lugia; and Primal Kyogre checks such as Primal Groudon, Latias, and Latios are all good teammates for Arceus-Steel. Xerneas is a good partner for Arceus-Steel, because it can weaken some of Arceus-Steel's checks such as Primal Groudon. Fire-types such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are also good partners, because they take advantage of Steel-types like Skarmory that switch in on Arceus-Steel.</p>"

  "Arceus-Water": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Water finds its ways of usage in ORAS tied almost entirely to Primal Groudon, a newcomer to ORAS. Primal Groudon alone has invalidated previously viable sets thanks to immunities to Will-O-Wisp and Water-type Judgment, rendering more offensive mono-attacking sets useless. At the same time, however, Arceus-Water's role has adapted around Primal Groudon, and it now sits as the ideal support Arceus of choice thanks to its typing, giving it key resistances to Fire- and Water-type moves that make it relatively easy to fit onto balanced and stall teams alike. Arceus-Water's neutrality to Fairy- and Dragon-type moves as well as a resistance to Ice-type moves gives it different advantages over its main competition for a support role, Arceus-Dragon. Arceus-Water may have only one viable set, but it does its role with varying degrees of effectiveness as both a potential Defogger and a check to top-tier threats such as Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Ho-Oh all in one Pokemon. Arceus-Water's effectiveness has brought adaptations from the very Pokemon it checks, however, making its job a little more difficult, with sets such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon and Double-Edge Mega Salamence rising as common sets due to their increased effectiveness against Arceus-Water. Arceus-Water also has some issues with its moveslots, leaving it unable to perform all its possible roles with just four moves, leading to some team-based moveset choices. Arceus-Water is also vulnerable to entry hazards, status moves, and being trapped by Shadow Tag users, all things that the Ubers metagame has plenty of, which can keep Arceus-Water's effectiveness down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Arceus-Water only has one truly viable set in ORAS Ubers, but that set has a couple of niche possibilities to work with. Reflect provides extra assistance against physical attackers that may otherwise overwhelm Arceus-Water. Grass Knot deals more damage against Primal Groudon, but more importantly, it 3HKOes Primal Kyogre. This means Primal Kyogre cannot PP stall Arceus-Water via Rest loops in a one-on-one situation. Iron Defense is a very niche option and hard to fit but can assist against sweepers that may set up on Arceus-Water, such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Dialga, Ferrothorn, and Klefki can all set entry hazards against Arceus-Water and stall it out with Toxic, or Leech Seed in Ferrothorn's case. Arceus-Water's options against Steel-types are limited, as the threat of status can make dueling them very risky. Arceus-Water's attacks can also prove to be very underwhelming against Dialga and Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag</strong>: Shadow Tag users such as Mega Gengar and the rare Gothitelle can trap and remove Arceus-Water easily, paving the way for opposing sweepers to take over the match. Wobbuffet has a much harder time against Arceus-Water, however, as Arceus-Water can use non-attacking moves such as Toxic to avoid being Encored into attacking Wobbuffet, meaning Wobbuffet has no way to actually take Arceus-Water down.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas, Nasty Plot Darkrai, and Swords Dance Arceus formes can threaten to set up and overwhelm Arceus-Water or just force it out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Chansey and Blissey are impossible for Arceus-Water to take down thanks to their very high special bulk and Natural Cure to prevent being Toxic stalled. They can also pass Wishes or use Heal Bell freely against Arceus-Water.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Arceus-Water's attacks against Latios and Latias are not strong enough to prevent them from coming in freely. Latios and Latias are usually faster and have recovery to prevent chip damage from taking them out. Without Grass Knot or Thunder, however, Latios and Latias open themselves up to the possibility that Arceus-Water can use Recover as it takes Draco Meteor, as it does not OHKO, and stall them out afterwards. Calm Mind sets will just blow right past Arceus-Water, however.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Arceus-Water can have trouble dealing meaningful damage to Primal Kyogre, and this can result in a stalemate depending on Primal Kyogre's set. Calm Mind + 3 attacks sets can overpower Arceus-Water, while defensive sets using Rest can PP stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom risks being 2HKOed by Ice Beam if it switches directly into Arceus-Water, but if Zekrom comes in safely, it will easily OHKO Arceus-Water with Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Shaymin-S</strong>: Shaymin-S can have trouble switching into Arceus-Water, but if it gets in safely, it can threaten to OHKO with a Life Orb-boosted Seed Flare.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choosing the first two moveslots on Arceus-Water tends to come down to what the rest of the team requires. The most flexible option is to go with the combination of Judgment and Ice Beam. Judgment gives Arceus-Water the ideal effectiveness against Ho-Oh, Arceus-Ground, and Klefki, and Ice Beam covers Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Rayquaza while also being able to get small damage on Primal Groudon if necessary. If Defog is needed somewhere on the team, either Judgment or Ice Beam can be used alongside it, depending on where the team needs the extra support. The combination of Judgment and Defog works best when there are secondary Mega Salamence and Rayquaza answers on the team to make up for the loss of Ice Beam, with examples being Shuca Berry Dialga and Lugia. Ice Beam and Defog make for a more passive combination, as it can be lacking in power against some of Arceus-Water's switch-ins such as Steel-types, but it can be effective as a replacement to Arceus-Dragon in cases where using Arceus-Dragon would give too much of a Mega Diancie weakness, which can show in teams that do not use Bronzong. Defog provides freedom from entry hazards for both sides of the field, which can make using Pokemon such as Ho-Oh much more effective against the opponent, but is not mandatory on this set if a team doesn't require it or already has it elsewhere. Recover, however, is required to ensure Arceus-Water stays as healthy as possible throughout a match. Toxic is also mandatory to properly check some Primal Groudon sets, as well as provide pressure against Pokemon such as Ho-Oh.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Generally, Arceus-Water should always be fully invested in HP to maximize bulk as much as possible. Ideally being used as a physically defensive wall, Arceus-Water should also be invested in Defense once the amount of Speed it requires to support the team properly is cleared up. The standard option is to go with 16 Speed EVs, and the rest in Defense with a Bold nature. 16 Speed EVs is enough to outspeed neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon, but Arceus-Water will fail to be faster than Pokemon such as Jolly Primal Groudon. This is less of a worry, however, as Jolly Primal Groudon sets tend to be tailored specifically to break Arceus-Water, meaning no amount of Speed investment will help against it. A secondary option is to use 124 Speed EVs to outspeed positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon. This can come in handy against Ho-Oh specifically, as Jolly Ho-Oh can be potentially stalled out with Recover while it takes itself down with Brave Bird recoil. Another option is to use 168 Speed EVs, which allows Arceus-Water to outspeed up to positive-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Rayquaza but comes with a considerable loss in Defense investment, which can be a large problem against the Pokemon that Arceus-Water is used to check.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Arceus-Water is best used as a check to physical attackers such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence, and in most cases, should be switched in against them as a first option. However, there are Primal Groudon sets to keep an eye out for, such as Swords Dance sets from more offensive teams as well as Rest sets on more defensive teams. Swords Dance Primal Groudon will break Arceus-Water easily, so the ideal scenario is to get a Toxic on Primal Groudon and play around it using other teammates until Toxic damage racks up and takes it down. Rest Primal Groudon sets result in a stalemate for both sides, as neither Arceus-Water nor Primal Groudon can damage each other enough to break the stalemate. Switching out while Primal Groudon is sleeping is generally the best option. Stealth Rock Primal Groudon sets and most Rock Polish sets tend to be safer matchups for Arceus-Water, as they do not typically carry Swords Dance. However, Primal Groudon can fit Swords Dance on a Rock Polish set, or even on a Stealth Rock set, meaning the bottom line is to keep a close eye out for what set the enemy Primal Groudon could be using during a match to better assess what Arceus-Water's capabilities against it are. Double-Edge Mega Salamence and Adamant Choice Band Ho-Oh sets should also be carefully played around, as with Stealth Rock on your side of the field, Arceus-Water's chances against them go down considerably. Keep in mind that a well-played Ho-Oh will aim to burn Arceus-Water with Sacred Fire early on and then use the burn damage to its advantage and potentially break Arceus-Water later on in the match. Spreading Toxic against the enemy team can punish switches and provide pressure on the opponent, but some Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Xerneas may be better off paralyzed. This is because Mega Salamence commonly runs Facade, and it is much more difficult to stop if it cannot be paralyzed, as it has 140-Base Power STAB Facades to throw around. Xerneas falls under a similar line of thinking, as Geomancy Xerneas can also be much harder to stop for some teams if it cannot be paralyzed by checks such as Klefki. Play carefully around Mega Gengar, as it can trap and remove Arceus-Water. Mega Gengar is frail, however, and cannot directly switch into or easily take down Arceus-Water sets running Judgment without Destiny Bond. When using Defog, Arceus-Water is usually able to Defog on Stealth Rock Primal Groudon sets but has trouble against Dialga and will be Taunted by a lead Deoxys-S, meaning that Defog is best used on forced switches. Arceus-Water can have Spikes set against it by Steel-type setters such as Ferrothorn, Klefki, and potentially Skarmory. Klefki and Skarmory have a much easier time against Arceus-Water sets that are not running Judgment, but the threat of taking a Toxic from Klefki or Skarmory can force Arceus-Water out, giving them a free turn to set Spikes. If Primal Kyogre comes in against Primal Groudon, meaning that Primordial Sea has overridden Desolate Land, Arceus-Water can be used as a pivot against it and can then be switched back out to Primal Groudon to regain control.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Arceus-Water can fit onto most balanced and stall teams due to its synergy with other defensive walls, typing, and rare traits. Primal Groudon is the ideal partner for Arceus-Water, as together, they can check a large portion of the metagame. Specifically, Primal Groudon keeps threats to Arceus-Water such as Steel-types, Primal Kyogre, and Xerneas down. Ho-Oh appreciates the Defog support and Arceus-Water's ability to check Pokemon such as opposing Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Arceus-Rock. Giratina-O works well with Arceus-Water, as it can use Defog itself, giving Arceus-Water the freedom to use two attacks. Klefki also works as a backbone alongside Arceus-Water, checking Darkrai, Xerneas, Latios, and Latias. Offensive Xerneas sets also work as a threat to offensive teams that threaten to overpower Arceus-Water and can use Aromatherapy in a pinch if necessary. Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie make for good partners, as they can help against entry hazards, status moves, and various other Pokemon depending on the Magic Bounce user. Mega Sableye fits best on a stall team alongside Arceus-Water, while Mega Diancie better fits balance-styled teams alongside it. Lugia fits well on more defensive teams, providing a secondary check to Mega Salamence and Primal Groudon and just adds an extra general physical wall to assist Arceus-Water. Arceus-Water can provide Defog support in return to keep Lugia's Multiscale intact.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Greninja has a high Speed stat that allows it to function well as a suicide lead in Ubers. Furthermore, Greninja has a great ability, Protean, which allows it to switch its type depending on what move it uses, meaning it can easily play around opponents. Greninja has a huge movepool with many status moves as well as physical and special moves. However, one of Greninja's downsides is its mediocre offensive stats and bulk. Additionally, Greninja can be stopped quite easily by faster offensive attackers. Lastly, Greninja faces huge competition from the Deoxys formes as a suicide lead, although its niche lies in Toxic Spikes and its ability to block Rapid Spin because of Protean Shadow Sneak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An all-out attacking set with great coverage such as Gunk Shot, which can OHKO Xerneas, Low Kick, and Grass Knot, which can 2HKO Primal Groudon, is usable, but such a set is largely outclassed by Deoxys-A, which has superior offensive presence. U-turn can be used by Greninja to maintain momentum and switch out of its checks and counters, but Greninja cannot miss out on any of its current moves as it will lack a hazard, a block to Defog, or a block to Rapid Spin. Additionally, Haze is an option to remove stat boosts, but Taunt prevents the opponent from setting up on Greninja anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Darkrai</strong>: Darkrai outspeeds Greninja and puts it to sleep with Dark Void, preventing it from setting up hazards. However, it doesn't like taking a Gunk Shot.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie bounce back the entry hazards Greninja tries to set up and beat it with one of their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Faster Taunt users such as Darkrai and Deoxys-S can Taunt Greninja, preventing it from setting up Spikes, though the latter needs to be wary of Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: As Greninja is frail, strong priority such as an Extreme Speed from Deoxys-A or Arceus can quickly bring Greninja to its end.</p>",

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes is an entry hazard that affects all Pokemon not immune to poison on the switch in, and it eventually wears down most Pokemon after two layers. Spikes is another hazard that hurts the opponent on the switch in, and it also removes the effect of any Focus Sash. Taunt prevents the opponent from using any status attack against Greninja, most notably Defog, which can remove the hazards Greninja has set up. Shadow Sneak allows Greninja to change its typing to Ghost, which allows it to block Rapid Spin. It also helps Greninja pick off weakened Pokemon and beat Deoxys-A. Hydro Pump is another option to use in order to hit Mega Diancie for super effective damage, which is important as Mega Diancie bounces hazards back and can OHKO Greninja with a super effective Moonblast. Other notable targets for Hydro Pump are Mega Sableye and Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Protean allows Greninja to play around with the opponent by changing its type every time it uses a move with a different typing. Focus Sash is the best item because it prevents Greninja from being OHKOed, guaranteeing that it will be able to get up a hazard or Taunt a Pokemon. The Attack EVs help Greninja to 3HKO Deoxys-S, and the Speed EVs help Greninja to outspeed Arceus variants so that it can Taunt them before they set up. A Jolly nature helps Greninja to outspeed up to base 120 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Salamence. If Greninja runs Hydro Pump, make sure to use an EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe along with a Timid nature because this allows Greninja to OHKO Naive Mega Diancie if it tries to switch in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Greninja works best as a lead, although you must be careful when dealing with Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie. Set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes depending on the opposing team; Spikes troubles bulky offense teams, while Toxic Spikes beats up defensive teams by dealing damage every turn. Use Taunt when predicting the opponent to set up on you, use Defog, or set up their own hazards. Shadow Sneak is the best option to use if you predict the opponent will try to Rapid Spin away your hazards, and it has the added benefit of beating common leads such as Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Support from offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Mega Salamence, Genesect, and Primal Groudon is good because they prevent the opponent from using Rapid Spin or Defog. Other Taunt users such as Yveltal or Darkrai can prevent the opponent from removing your hazards with Defog once Greninja has fainted. Aside from those, Pokemon that can deal with a Darkrai lead such as Mega Diancie make for good partners too, as its ability, Magic Bounce, will bounce back Dark Void which would prevent Greninja from setting up hazards. However, when predicting the opponent with Darkrai, lead with Diancie, as it won't bounce back hazards when it switches in as regular Diancie. Furthermore, Primal Groudon is another good partner as it can set up Stealth Rock and benefit from the Toxic Spikes, which wear down its defensive checks. Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Kyurem-W, and Darkrai that appreciate having hazards on the field to net KOs more easily make good partners. Other examples of good teammates include Mega Scizor and Primal Kyogre, which beat Mega Diancie, and Xerneas, which beats Mega Sableye. Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar or Aegislash, can help to trap Latios and Latias which can try to Defog. Powerful U-turn users such as Scizor and Landorus-T make good partners too, as they can lead and hit opposing Deoxys formes and then switch into Greninja, which can then beat them with a Shadow Sneak. Lastly, Pokemon that can make foes flinch, such as Shaymin-S or Mega Kangaskhan, benefit from poison damage that Toxic Spikes provide.</p>"

Flygon also has access to Defog, which it can use reliably against Primal Groudon to keep Stealth Rock off the field while also stalling it with Toxic and Roost. It further stands out as a Defog user thanks to a resistance to Stealth Rock and immunities to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which help it avoid being worn down. While Flygon is immune to Thunder Wave, it is susceptible to other forms of status, such as burn and poison. Furthermore, Flygon is rather passive and can give free turns to opposing Pokemon, especially those immune to Ground. Flygon also faces competition from other Defog users; however, running Defog on Flygon frees up the Arceus slot to run a more offensive set. While Flygon is a good check to Primal Groudon and a reliable Defog user, it does not do much else besides this.</p>",

Toxic allows Flygon to wear down and stall out Primal Groudon; it is also Flygon's best way to deter switch-ins that do not mind Earth Power.

After switching into Primal Groudon, select a move according to circumstance; use Defog if entry hazards need to be removed, Roost if Flygon needs to recover HP, Toxic if the former two moves do not need to be used and spreading Toxic is beneficial, and Earth Power to hit Steel-types and weakened or poisoned Primal Groudon. U-turn should be used on predicted switches to keep momentum, but make sure that Flygon remains healthy enough to continually check Primal Groudon. Some scouting of sets may be necessary, as Flygon cannot switch in and beat Rock Polish Primal Groudon with Dragon Claw or Dragon Pulse, and support Arceus-Ground with Ice Beam will KO Flygon. Be wary when using Toxic against a team that has Magic Bounce users, as poison greatly limits Flygon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flying-types, especially Ho-Oh and Lugia, appreciate Flygon's ability to use Defog reliably against Primal Groudon. Xerneas checks, such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Klefki, and Aegislash also make for good partners. Offensive Arceus formes with Swords Dance or Calm Mind appreciate Flygon's Defog allowing them to run a more offensive set instead. Arceus-Rock is a good teammate for Flygon because it checks Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence. Finally, Mega Sableye completes an excellent core for controlling entry hazards, as it can deal with Pokemon that Flygon cannot, such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Deoxys-S.</p>"

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash is a brilliant Xerneas check and a solid user of Pursuit that can trap Latios, Latias, Deoxys-A, and Mega Gengar, as well as being an all-around solid wall. Aegislash also has a unique move in King's Shield, which drops an opposing Pokemon's Attack by two stages if their move makes contact. Aegislash also has the ability to punish its switch-ins with Toxic. However, many powerful Pokemon can overwhelm Aegislash. Another flaw is that Aegislash lacks reliable recovery outside of Leftovers, which can always be Knocked Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aegislash is very specialized, so it does not have many alternative options that are viable. Sacred Sword can be used to KO Ferrothorn after luring it in. Head Smash and maximum Speed can be used to OHKO Ho-Oh and 2HKO Primal Groudon with a minus Speed nature, but has large recoil damage. Rock Slide is an alternative to Head Smash that comes without the recoil, but fails to OHKO Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock damage. A RestTalk set can be used, but the recovery is unreliable, and Aegislash sorely misses Toxic. Shadow Ball hits Mewtwo and Primal Groudon for decent damage. A Choice Specs set with Shadow Ball / Flash Cannon / Head Smash / Gyro Ball can be used for the surprise factor, as well as its reasonable damage output.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Primal Groudon hates Toxic, but takes Gyro Ball very well, forces Aegislash out, and can set up Stealth Rock or use Rock Polish or Swords Dance and proceed to sweep. Ho-Oh is very similar to Primal Groudon, but has Regenerator and Roost to heal off Toxic damage and can set up a Substitute as it forces Aegislash out. However, it needs to be wary of Rock Slide or Head Smash.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Arceus-Poison and Tentacruel can burn Aegislash with Will-O-Wisp and Scald respectively. As these Pokemon are immune to Toxic, they can switch in and out without fearing any of Aegislash's moves. Arceus-Poison can also burn Aegislash while not being affected by King's Shield, due to Will-O-Wisp being a status move.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Most Dark-types fear Toxic, but Arceus-Dark can Refresh it off and set up Calm Mind as it forces out Aegislash with the threat of a super effective Judgment. Yveltal doesn't like Toxic either, but has Oblivion Wing to recover HP and can Taunt Aegislash to prevent it from using King's Shield again or fire off a super effective Dark Pulse. Darkrai can take a Toxic if need be, but its high Speed means that it won't appreciate coming in on a Gyro Ball or a Sacred Sword. It does force Aegislash out, however, and can set up a Nasty Plot or a Substitute on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn is immune to Toxic and only fears the rare Sacred Sword. It can set up entry hazards or sap Aegislash's health with Leech Seed. Dialga also fears nothing but Sacred Sword and can force Aegislash out with the threat of a Fire Blast, then proceed to set up Stealth Rock on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O doesn't like coming in on Toxic or Shadow Ball, but can hit Aegislash with its super effective STAB Shadow Force, which can't be blocked by King's Shield.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>King's Shield allows Aegislash to regain its solid defensive stats and scout for moves. An added benefit is that King's Shield can drop an opposing Pokemon's Attack if they use a contact move. Gyro Ball is the most powerful move Aegislash can use against offensive Xerneas. Toxic is used to spread consistent damage and punish switch-ins. Pursuit is used to trap Pokemon such as Latias and Deoxys-A, but can also help prevent team members from being sniped by Mega Gengar. If your team doesn't require Pursuit support, then Shadow Sneak can be used as priority or as a method of KOing weakened sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs are used so that Gyro Ball does maximum damage. Maximum HP and Special Defense investment is so that Aegislash can fulfill its primary purpose of checking Geomancy Xerneas. The remaining EVs are thrown into Defense to help soften physical attacks. Leftovers is used so that Aegislash has a reliable method of recovering HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try not to switch in too aggressively against offensive Xerneas, as smart players will wear Aegislash down until it cannot check the Geomancy set. Use Toxic liberally, as it is the only move Aegislash has to punish switch-ins. Try not to take any hits in Blade forme, as its defenses are very low. However, don't use King's Shield too often; if the opponent predicts it, then they receive a free turn. Also remember that King's Shield fails against Shadow Force and its users will neither suffer the Attack drop nor have their attack blocked. Status effects, especially burns, compromise Aegislash's ability to check Xerneas, so it is best to avoid them. Try Pursuit trapping Latios, Latias, Mega Gengar, and Deoxys-A, but be careful if the opponent has both a Xerneas and one of the aforementioned threats, as this can lead to Aegislash becoming too weak to prevent Xerneas sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Clerics such as Xerneas and Clefable can help cure status effects for Aegislash, while Aegislash can Pursuit trap threats such as Mega Gengar for them. Clefable can also provide Wish support, while both Xerneas and Clefable can help check Yveltal for Aegislash. A solid Primal Groudon check is a must, as all Aegislash can do to punish it is to Toxic Primal Groudon on the switch. Lugia and Arceus-Ground can both take on Primal Groudon and Defog away entry hazards. Other options for entry hazard removal include Giratina-O and Tentacruel, while Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce ability can help prevent entry hazards going up altogether. Last but not least, remember that Aegislash is a utility Pokemon that should fit the needs of your team and so should not be built around.</p>"

  "Giratina-Origin": {
    "overview": "<p>Giratina-O is an effective Defogger that can check a lot of the physically oriented Pokemon in the Ubers metagame. It has solid 150 / 100 / 100 bulk and a good typing that offers six resistances and three immunities counting its ability, Levitate. This allows Giratina-O to check Primal Groudon, Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Kangaskhan, some Mewtwo variants, Mega Blaziken, and other Fighting-types. Being a Ghost-type, Giratina-O is able to escape Shadow Tag and other means of trapping, and because it has Levitate, it is immune to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web, and it is neutral to Stealth Rock. This makes Giratina-O a very reliable Defog user in the Ubers metagame. Additionally, Ghost is a potent offensive typing that has good neutral coverage and also gives it a niche in stopping Rapid Spin. However, a lack of reliable recovery plagues Giratina-O, as it is worn down by repeated attacks and residual damage from status and Stealth Rock. Giratina-O is forced to run Griseous Orb as well, and, while this provides a nice offensive boost to Giratina-O's STAB moves, it limits versatility and does not allow for the passive healing of Leftovers. It also faces new competition for a Defog slot from Latias and Latios, which boast similar advantages in bulk and Levitate, but they have access to reliable recovery in the form of Roost and Recover.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giratina-O has a number of viable alternatives, but it is hard-pressed to make space in its four moveslots. A mixed attacking set with Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball can be used, which allows Giratina-O to bypass physically defensive walls. Magic Coat is a cool move that anti-leads very effectively by bouncing back entry hazards, Taunt, and status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Substitute eases prediction and blocks status while making Shadow Force easier to use; however, it tends to run through Giratina-O's limited HP quickly. Rest is Giratina-O's only viable recovery move and means of removing status, so it can be used to increase longevity. Giratina-O tends to draw Fairy-types to itself, so Iron Tail is a viable move to hit them. If accuracy and Fairy-types are problematic, Roar is another phazing option which Giratina-O has. Toxic puts timers on opposing Pokemon, including both Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, which cannot be burned, and support Arceus formes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types make for the best checks to Giratina-O, as they resist Ghost and threaten with super effective Dark-type moves. Yveltal easily switches in and OHKOes Giratina-O with Dark Pulse, though it can be hit with Stone Edge as it switches in. Darkrai threatens Giratina-O with a powerful Dark Pulse, and it can put a teammate to sleep with Dark Void. Arceus-Dark switches in and can threaten Giratina-O with Dark-type Judgment or set up Calm Mind. Both must be careful about switching into a Thunder Wave from the Hex set, however. Tyranitar can switch in relatively easily, but it dislikes being burned and does not do too much damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Bulky Fairy-types threaten Giratina-O, though they do not resist Ghost-type attacks. Defensive Xerneas does not take too much from Giratina-O's attacks and deals heavy damage with Moonblast. Arceus-Fairy fears little from Giratina-O, threatens with Judgment, and can use Defog, Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, or Calm Mind. Clefable can use Giratina-O to pass Wishes and clear status with Heal Bell; it also threatens to use Moonblast, albeit a weaker one. Shadow Force does a lot of damage to Clefable, however.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Assuming that Stealth Rock is not set up on Ho-Oh's side and Giratina-O is not running the uncommon Stone Edge, Ho-Oh freely switches in on Giratina-O and deals a lot of damage, as Dragon Tail damage is negated by Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Fast Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types that outspeed Giratina-O can threaten it out with a powerful Dragon-type move. Zekrom can outspeed and hit Giratina-O with a powerful Outrage, Dragon Claw, or Draco Meteor, while Palkia outspeeds and hits Giratina-O with Spacial Rend. However, neither enjoys switching into a Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Due to Giratina-O's lack of reliable recovery or way to rid itself of status, Toxic wears it down very rapidly and makes it susceptible to being overwhelmed by repeated hits.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "ParaHex": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hex is Giratina-O's main STAB move. While its Base Power is lower than that of Shadow Ball, it inflicts double the damage against any Pokemon afflicted with status. Draco Meteor hits Pokemon immune or resistant to Ghost-type attacks for massive damage. It also hits Pokemon without status harder than Hex. Thunder Wave is used to cripple switch-ins like Xerneas and Arceus formes so Giratina-O can then hit them with a boosted Hex. Finally, Defog is used to remove entry hazards. Shadow Sneak is a noteworthy option; it's a decent priority move that deals great damage to Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, Deoxys-A, and Deoxys-S. Dragon Tail can be considered too because it allows Giratina-O to phaze Extreme Killer Arceus and Primal Groudon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Defense are used to make sure Giratina-O survives a +2 Shadow Claw from Adamant Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock damage. It also gives it enough bulk to survive two +2 Stone Edge hits from Arceus-Ground after Stealth Rock damage. Note that Giratina-O has high base HP, so investing the EVs in Defense instead is more effective and gives it better physical bulk. 244 EVs in Special Attack with a Modest nature make Giratina-O hit for maximum damage. Finally, 12 Speed EVs let Giratina-O outpace maximum Speed Diancie before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in Giratina-O on Primal Groudon, as it's immune to Ground-type attacks. Once Giratina-O is in, you can either use Defog, use Draco Meteor, or predict the switch out and use Thunder Wave. Lead with it against Deoxys-S; it will be wary of using Taunt turn one because Shadow Sneak 2HKOes it, so you can use Thunder Wave and then Defog or Hex to KO it and prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock on your side. Giratina-O also checks Extreme Killer Arceus, so don't hesitate to switch it in if needed. It also checks Mega Salamence in a pinch, as it survives a +1 Double-Edge. Finally, keep Giratina-O safe from poison and burn because status wears it down very quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pair Giratina-O with Pokemon carrying status moves like Klefki, Primal Groudon, and support Arceus formes so it can utilize Hex more easily. Pairing it with Hex Mega Gengar is encouraged too, as double Hex works well in the metagame. Giratina-O can only significantly damage Ho-Oh when the latter is afflicted with status, so a solid check to it like Arceus-Water is mandatory, especially considering that Ho-Oh can burn Giratina-O with Sacred Fire or inflict huge damage on it with Brave Bird. Furthermore, Arceus-Water provides a secondary Primal Groudon check and can also check Mega Diancie, a Pokemon that hugely annoys Giratina-O. Dark-type Pokemon greatly threaten this Giratina-O set, so Fairy-type Pokemon like Klefki and Xerneas should be supporting it. Finally, solid checks to Xerneas like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are important, while a switch-in to Dragon-type moves like Klefki is needed to take the Draco Meteor of the faster Latios and Latias.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is used to clear entry hazards and free up an Arceus slot. Shadow Sneak allows Giratina-O to anti-lead Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S; priority has a lot of utility in general. Dragon Tail allows Giratina-O to phaze setup sweepers that would be difficult to stop otherwise, such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus. Shadow Force is a very strong physical attack in general coming from a decent base 120 Attack stat further boosted by Griseous Orb. It also stops Geomancy Xerneas from setting up, as it hopefully puts Xerneas in range of Shadow Sneak after a bit of prior damage. Earthquake can hit Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Diancie super effectively. Will-O-Wisp gives Giratina-O a second way to deal with physical attackers besides Dragon Tail, and it should be used if a team absolutely needs a burn on setup sweepers such as Ground and Extreme Killer Arceus. It also gets passive damage on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Yveltal, and Clefable. Lastly, Stone Edge is a viable move used to deal with Ho-Oh, which Giratina-O often lures in, and hit Yveltal on the switch. It should be noted that if the role of entry hazard removal is already fulfilled by one of Giratina-O's teammates, another move can replace Defog on this set, making Giratina-O more of a specific check for physical attackers than an entry hazard-controlling support Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Griseous Orb is the mandatory item for Giratina-O. 248 Defense EVs allow Giratina-O to evade the KO from a +2 Adamant Extreme Killer Arceus's Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock damage. 12 Speed EVs let Giratina-O outpace maximum Speed Diancie before it Mega Evolves. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack and give Giratina-O the ability to hit harder in general; for example, with the EVs, Giratina-O has a stronger Shadow Sneak for picking off weakened foes, deals more chip damage with Dragon Tail, and hits Xerneas harder with Shadow Force. However, an alternative spread of 148 HP / 100 Atk / 248 Def / 12 Spe, which invests enough Attack to 2HKO Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak, can be used with Earthquake; otherwise, if running Shadow Force, maximum Attack investment is important to hit Xerneas harder.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is important to try to utilize immunities and resistances to get Giratina-O in safely. The need to use Defog should often be weighed, as having Stealth Rock up on your opponent's side can greatly increase the effectiveness of spamming Dragon Tail. However, be wary when the opponent has a Fairy-type Pokemon in the back when spamming Dragon Tail. Finally, try to minimize the residual damage that Giratina-O takes, as the lack of recovery makes Giratina-O susceptible to being worn down. If Giratina-O is needed to check a specific threat, it is important to preserve Giratina-O's HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is greatly appreciated to make Dragon Tail more effective. Bulky Stealth Rock setters make for the best partners; two examples are Dialga and Primal Groudon. Stealth Rock setters that can set up consistently over the course of a match are greatly preferred over suicide entry hazard leads. Giratina-O also appreciates teammates that check Fairy-types, such as Klefki, Scizor, Metagross, Aegislash, Jirachi, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon. It should be noted that the Fairy checks with a secondary Ghost or Psychic typing can compound weaknesses to Dark-types, which is not ideal. Giratina-O also appreciates Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Clefable, and Klefki as partners, because they check Dark-types for Giratina-O. Wish and cleric support from the likes of Blissey, Clefable, and Diancie on bulkier teams can keep Giratina-O healthy and prevent it from being overwhelmed. Offensive Arceus formes such as Swords Dance Arceus-Ground and Calm Mind Arceus-Dark appreciate the Defog role filled by Giratina-O, because this means that a support Arceus forme does not need to be used.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With access to both Trick Room and Magic Coat, Cresselia shines against offensive teams, checking Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Mewtwo, and Deoxys-A thanks to its great 120 / 120 / 130 bulk. Furthermore, Cresselia has access to Lunar Dance, a rare and useful utility move that prevents Cresselia from being total setup bait by letting it get a teammate in healthy. However, Mega Gengar and Steel-type Pokemon give it a very hard time. Balanced and stall teams, which don't care about Trick Room, run many Pokemon that wall Cresselia. It also lacks a phazing move, which makes it setup bait for any Pokemon running Aromatherapy, Substitute, or Refresh. Finally, Cresselia faces steep competition with Lugia, especially with regards to defensive duties.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A fully defensive set with Moonlight / Toxic / Ice Beam / Protect is decent but outclassed by Lugia. Psychic is an option to hit Mega Gengar hard. A dual screens set with Light Clay is a noteworthy option. Finally, Icy Wind could be used instead of Ice Beam to slow down foes. However, Ice Beam is stronger, and Icy Wind is counterproductive with Trick Room.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar is immune to Toxic and takes little damage from Ice Beam. It will trap Cresselia and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, such as Klefki, Bronzong, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Aegislash, Jirachi, Forretress, and Mega Scizor, are immune to Toxic. They can cripple Cresselia with Toxic or set up entry hazards if it lacks Magic Coat.</p> <p><strong>Aromatherapy + Geomancy Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas can set up on Cresselia and rid itself of status with Aromatherapy if Cresselia uses Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Refresh and Substitute Users</strong>: Pokemon with these two moves, such as Calm Mind Arceus formes, can set up Substitute on Cresselia and use Refresh if inflicted with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Dark- and Ghost-type Pokemon</strong>: Darkrai, Yveltal and Arceus-Ghost can Taunt Cresselia or hit it with super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Mental Herb only works once. After that, Cresselia is totally vulnerable to Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie</strong>: Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie have Magic Bounce and thus can bounce Toxic back to Cresselia. They also take minimal damage from Ice Beam. It's also important to note that Mega Sableye is slow and thus uses Trick Room to its advantage.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Primal Kyogre</strong>: Defensive Primal Kyogre has Rest to heal itself from Toxic, as well as Scald to deal decent damage to Cresselia.</p>",

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room has a strong niche against offensive teams. Lunar Dance allows Cresselia to heal any Pokemon on the player's team but KOes it in the process. Toxic is used to cripple Primal Groudon as well as other Pokemon that can take advantage of Cresselia's lack of offensive power to set up. Ice Beam 2HKOes Mega Salamence and Rayquaza. It also chips away at Pokemon neutral to it and prevents Struggle recoil if Cresselia happens to get crippled by Taunt. Alternatively, Magic Coat bounces back Taunt, status moves, and entry hazards. However, it should only be used instead of Ice Beam if the team has another Mega Salamence check.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature maximize Cresselia's physical bulk in order to deal with Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Mega Salamence well. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Defense to offer a negligible amount of help against special attacks such as Primal Groudon's Lava Plume. Mental Herb allows Cresselia to use Trick Room even through a foe's Taunt. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet is a very useful item to inflict chip damage on physically offensive Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Extreme Killer Arceus. It is also good against Dragon Tail Primal Groudon trying to phaze Cresselia on the switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against hyper offense, Cresselia can only use Trick Room once, so time it well. Also, make sure to keep Cresselia healthy for Mega Salamence and Rayquaza. However, pay attention to Rayquaza because its Choice Band set 2HKOes Cresselia with Dragon Accent. Use Lunar Dance when you don't need Cresselia anymore or when you really need to heal a certain threat's check. Against stall and bulky balanced teams, use your stallbreaker until it's weakened, and then switch it out to heal it later with Cresselia's Lunar Dance. Never use Trick Room against stall teams, as Pokemon on these teams are really slow. Against Xerneas with Aromatherapy or any other Pokemon trying to set up on Cresselia, use Trick Room and then use Lunar Dance to bring in your check to them, especially if it's weakened. Against Taunt users, use Trick Room on the same turn Mental Herb activates, and then use Toxic or switch out. If you opted for Rocky Helmet, make sure to switch Cresselia in on possible contact moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cresselia shines on balanced and bulky offensive teams. It's especially good with Pokemon that can take advantage of Trick Room like Eruption Primal Groudon, offensive Life Orb Dialga, and Mega Mawile. It should also be paired with strong stallbreakers that can be healed with Lunar Dance such as Perish Trap Mega Gengar and paradancer Primal Groudon. Checks to Xerneas like Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Ho-Oh are mandatory. Finally, switch-ins to Dark-type attacks, such as Klefki and Xerneas, and to Ghost-type attacks, such as Yveltal, should be on the team to patch up Cresselia's weaknesses.</p>"

Clefable's access to good support moves such as Heal Bell and Wish allows it to heal its teammates, although the Wishes it passes are not especially large. Unfortunately, Clefable has mediocre defenses, but it can only invest in one defense stat; as such, it cannot check Swords Dance Arceus and Geomancy Xerneas with the same set. Clefable is also susceptible to all entry hazards, and it can be beaten by setup sweepers if it has been worn down too much by entry hazards. Additionally, Clefable is bait for numerous dominant threats in Ubers, such as Mega Gengar, Primal Groudon, and Ho-Oh.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can cripple fast threats such as Xerneas, Mewtwo, and Mega Salamence. Flamethrower can hit the Steel-types that threaten Clefable, but it is relatively weak. Clefable also has access to Stealth Rock, which can be used if none of Clefable's teammates can carry it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can switch into Clefable thanks to its resistance to Fairy and trap Clefable with Shadow Tag. It can then proceed to OHKO Clefable with Sludge Wave, leaving Clefable's team susceptible to various setup sweepers that it relied on Clefable to check. Mega Gengar can also remove Clefable with Perish Song.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types check Clefable, as they resist Moonblast and can overwhelm Clefable with powerful attacks. Ho-Oh easily switches into Clefable and threatens it with Sacred Fire and Brave Bird, both of which 2HKO physically defensive Clefable. Primal Groudon likewise switches in using its Fire typing and can use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or 2HKO Clefable with Precipice Blades.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types fear nothing from Clefable outside of the uncommon Flamethrower and can use the free turn that comes after switching in to set up entry hazards or hit Clefable with a super effective STAB move. Ferrothorn can switch in and set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, or it can hit Clefable with Gyro Ball; however, it must be especially wary of Flamethrower. Scizor also does not like taking Flamethrower, but it can switch in and hit Clefable for super effective damage with Bullet Punch. Klefki can switch in, set up Spikes, and spread status.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: While Primal Kyogre does not resist Fairy, it has high Special Defense that allows it to switch into Clefable with ease. It can then hit Clefable with a powerful Origin Pulse or set up with Calm Mind; defensive Primal Kyogre variants can beat Clefable by repeatedly using Scald and burning Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers can overpower even physically defensive Clefable, as Clefable's base 73 Defense is not high by Ubers standards. Mega Salamence does not enjoy taking a Moonblast from Clefable, but it threatens Clefable with a powerful Double-Edge or Return. Rayquaza similarly fears Moonblast but threatens Clefable with Dragon Ascent.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Passive damage from entry hazards and status conditions limits Clefable's ability to reliably check certain setup sweepers, because Clefable can be weakened to the point where some setup sweepers can OHKO or 2HKO it.</p>",

Calm Mind allows Clefable to set up on and check Calm Mind Arceus formes and Geomancy Xerneas more reliably. Moonblast is Clefable's best attack, as it bypasses Taunt while hitting Substitute Xerneas and Dark-types such as Yveltal. Moonlight is another recovery option for Clefable, condensing Protect and Wish to make room for another move; however, its low PP and weather dependency makes it less reliable than Wish and Protect.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unaware gives Clefable the ability to counter setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Arceus. 12 Speed EVs allow Clefable to outspeed Tyranitar with no Speed investment. 248 HP and Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature maximize Clefable's special bulk so that it can best take on Xerneas and Arceus while keeping an odd HP value to reduce damage from entry hazards. Leftovers gives Clefable important passive recovery and works nicely with Protect to avoid certain 2HKOs after residual damage from entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Clefable into Dark-types and other Pokemon that do not immediately threaten it to gain as many opportunities as possible to use Heal Bell and Wish. Strong special attackers such as Primal Kyogre will overpower Clefable, so they should be avoided. Protect should be used to gain extra recovery from Leftovers, but it should not be used unless necessary, because the free turn Protect gives opponents can easily be taken advantage of with a switch to threats such as Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Mega Gengar to punish Clefable and its teammates. Try to clear entry hazards when possible, as Clefable will be worn down by these, allowing threats such as Xerneas to 2HKO it. Mega Gengar threatens to trap and KO Clefable, so it should be avoided by double switching if possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Aegislash can trap Mega Gengar, which otherwise threatens to trap and KO Clefable. Fire-types such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon support Clefable well because they can take advantage of the Steel-types that check it. Ho-Oh checks such as Mega Diancie, Mega Salamence, Lugia, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Rock make for good teammates as well. Clefable also likes having teammates that can check Primal Groudon, such as Latias, Latios, Arceus-Ground, Lugia, Mega Salamence, and Giratina-O. Latias, Latios, and Primal Groudon are also the best switch-ins to Primal Kyogre, the main special attacker that Clefable struggles to deal with. Entry hazard control is important because Clefable can be worn down easily, so Defog Arceus formes, Latias, Latios, Excadrill, and Mega Sableye make for good partners. Physical walls such as Lugia, Mega Salamence, and support Arceus formes can check the strong physical threats that specially defensive Clefable has difficulty with. Tyranitar and Primal Groudon are also good teammates for Clefable, because they lack reliable recovery and benefit greatly from the Wish and cleric support that Clefable provides.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The Wish and Protect combination gives Clefable a form of reliable recovery; they also help stall out low PP moves such as Extreme Speed, while Wish allows Clefable to restore its teammates' HP. Heal Bell gives Clefable the ability to support its team by curing status conditions. Toxic can be used instead to deal passive damage to foes so that Clefable can stall them out with Wish and Protect more effectively. Moonblast allows Clefable to circumvent Taunt while also hitting Latias, Latios, and Dark-types for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Physically defensive Clefable serves as a check to Swords Dance Arceus formes, Latias, Latios, and some Mega Mewtwo X variants while also providing support for its team through Wish and Heal Bell. Unaware enables Clefable to wall Swords Dance Arceus formes by ignoring their Attack boosts. 12 Speed EVs allow Clefable to outspeed Tyranitar with no Speed investment. 248 HP EVs give Clefable an odd HP value while also maximizing physical bulk alongside 248 Defense EVs and a Bold nature, something that is particularly important given Clefable's mediocre Defense stat. Leftovers gives Clefable passive recovery, synergizing well with Protect to avoid some 2HKOs, especially if Clefable has taken a bit of prior damage from entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try to capitalize on the limited opportunities that physically defensive Clefable gets to pass Wishes and use Heal Bell. Protect should be used to gain extra Leftovers recovery if needed, but it should not be used mindlessly, as this can give the opponent an important free turn to take advantage of. It is important to clear entry hazards when the opportunity presents itself, as taking too much residual damage can leave Clefable unable to check the setup sweepers that it normally would be able to stop. Mega Gengar is a huge threat because it can trap and KO Clefable; double switching can be an effective strategy to avoid it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tyranitar and Aegislash are good partners because they can trap Mega Gengar with Pursuit. Tyranitar also appreciates the Wish and cleric support Clefable provides. Primal Groudon also appreciates this support and can threaten Steel-types that check Clefable; Ho-Oh also threatens Steel-types effectively. Pokemon that can remove entry hazards make for good partners, because entry hazards easily wear Clefable down. Clefable tends to give Fire-types free switches, so checks to Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon support it well; Mega Diancie, Mega Salamence, Lugia, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Rock can all check Ho-Oh, while Latias, Latios, Arceus-Ground, Lugia, Mega Salamence, and Giratina-O can all check Primal Groudon. Clefable also struggles against strong special attackers, such as Primal Kyogre, so Latias, Latios, and Primal Groudon make for good teammates because they can check Primal Kyogre.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel's niches in the Ubers metagame include providing entry hazard control with Rapid Spin and access to Toxic Spikes, which is especially good against offensive teams. Tentacruel counters leads such as Deoxys-S, Scolipede, and Greninja, as well as Klefki, Arceus-Water, Lugia, Skarmory, and Aegislash. It also checks Dialga, Ferrothorn, and Mega Gengar. A very important advantage Tentacruel also has is its ability to beat common Magic Bounce users with Scald, which is super effective against Mega Diancie and can cripple Mega Sableye with a burn.</p> <p>However, Tentacruel is setup bait for dangerous Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Primal Groudon. Additionally, Tentacruel's mediocre offenses make it easy for Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Mewtwo, and Ho-Oh to switch in and retaliate with powerful attacks. Finally, Tentacruel faces fierce competition from Arceus-Water and Primal Kyogre, which are both bulkier and stronger offensively but lack Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Confuse Ray can be used to annoy Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and other possible switch-ins. Ice Beam and Blizzard deal decent damage to Giratina-O, Latias, Latios, and Salamence on the switch in. Magic Coat is a nice option against offense to surprise Darkrai, which might lead against Tentacruel if the opponent anticipates it. Rest is an option if you have a cleric, but it makes Tentacruel even easier for foes to switch in on. Protect can be used to scout Choice-locked foes, but all the other moves have better utility. Haze is an option for stopping Baton Pass chains.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Offensive Pokemon That Don't Fear a Scald Burn</strong>: Primal Groudon, Refresh Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Refresh or Lum Berry Arceus can freely switch into Tentacruel and either fire off strong attacks or set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Rest Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre with Calm Mind and Rest can set up on Tentacruel and use Rest to heal any damage and status conditions taken.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye blocks Rapid Spin and bounces back status moves by virtue of its Ghost typing and ability, Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Latias, Latios, and Mewtwo take minimal damage from Scald and Knock Off and can OHKO Tentacruel in return.</p> <p><strong>Physically Offensive Pokemon That Fear a Scald Burn</strong>: Rayquaza, Mega Kangaskhan, Life Orb Arceus, offensive Arceus-Ghost, and Arceus-Ground can OHKO Tentacruel, but they must avoid being burned when switching in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spin Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is used for STAB and a very useful burn chance. Toxic Spikes punishes many teams, especially offensive teams lacking entry hazard removal. Rapid Spin is useful for removing hazards, especially against opposing leads. Toxic cripples common switch-ins to Tentacruel, such as Latias, Latios, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon. Knock Off is an option for hitting Latias, Latios, and Ho-Oh, although it gives Primal Groudon a free switch in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Calm nature minimizes the damage that Tentacruel takes from special attacks, particularly from Dialga's Draco Meteor so that Tentacruel is able to Rapid Spin away its Stealth Rock. Black Sludge offers passive recovery and punishes opposing Pokemon using Trick. Liquid Ooze punishes Ferrothorn and Shaymin-S if they use Leech Seed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If the opponent has Deoxys-S, Scolipede, or Greninja, lead with Tentacruel or switch it into them to remove their entry hazards by using Rapid Spin. Tentacruel can attempt to set up Toxic Spikes against those leads too. If you expect Latias to switch in, use Knock Off or Toxic, as Latias can pressure Tentacruel out and use Defog against it, so you need to cripple it early on. The same thing goes for Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon if Tentacruel has Toxic, because they can come in and KO Tentacruel, so it's better to cripple them early on. It's important to always switch Tentacruel in on the Pokemon it counters and try to cripple switch-ins, remove hazards, or get Toxic Spikes up. In addition, Scald should be used repeatedly when the opponent has Mega Sableye in order to cripple it with a burn, as it blocks Rapid Spin and bounces back Toxic Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tentacruel is good on bulky playstyles, such as balance and bulky offense, but it doesn't work well on hyper offense. To support Tentacruel, you need solid checks to Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Ho-Oh, as they seriously threaten Tentacruel. Klefki is a useful partner because of Prankster Thunder Wave, which helps Tentacruel fight offensive teams, while Wish support from Blissey or Alomomola is great for replenishing Tentacruel's health. Finally, pair Tentacruel with a Defogger that can beat Primal Groudon to have good entry hazard control between the two.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Slowbro is one of the premier defensive powerhouses in the Uber tier. Its magnificent bulk and decent typing allow it to wall top-tier threats such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Before Mega Evolving, Slowbro has access to Regenerator and Slack Off, which grants it the ability to switch in and out frequently without being worn down easily. It has a very wide movepool and reasonable Special Attack, which prevents it from being too passive. Slowbro's access to Thunder Wave aids it in shutting down physical sweepers and slowing faster Pokemon for its teammates to outspeed and possibly KO. While Slowbro is a fantastic wall, it has flaws just like every other Pokemon. Its Speed tier is terrible, so just about any Pokemon in the meta outspeeds it with ease. It has mediocre Special Defense, which prevents it from being an all-round wall, so it should not be switching into special attackers. Though its typing provides it with a few resistances, it also leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit, which Pokemon like Tyranitar can take advantage of. It loses Regenerator when Mega Evolving, which, while it doesn't completely cripple it, does force you to play a little more safely with it. Mega Slowbro also hates entry hazards and just about any type of damage that accumulates over time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trick Room can be run in order to aid slower teammates and Slowbro itself. Shadow Ball can be used to deal with Aegislash, Mew, and Mewtwo effectively. Yawn is an option to put sweepers to sleep and potentially begin a countersweep. Amnesia can help patch up Slowbro's mediocre Special Defense. Flamethrower and Fire Blast can be run in order to catch Steel-types off guard and potentially OHKO them. Grass Knot is a way to deal damage to Kyogre on the switch and hit Groudon a little harder. Psyshock is a move to consider, as it hits Gengar for super effective damage. Calm Mind can be run to serve as a boosting win condition on stall. This should only be run if the team does not already have one, however, as this set is outclassed by many other Calm Mind users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre can easily switch into Slowbro and OHKO it with Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such Darkrai and Yveltal easily beat Slowbro due to its weakness to Dark-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls are able to absorb any hit Slowbro wants to go for and can proceed to cripple it with a status move.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: As Slowbro will be switching in and out frequently, entry hazards will eventually wear it down, especially if it has Mega Evolved.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers can overwhelm Slowbro because of its lack of special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers with Taunt prevent Slowbro from using status moves and Slack Off, both of which are hugely important for it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Despite the lack of common Electric-types in Ubers, they still threaten Slowbro and can deal a great amount of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar traps Slowbro and easily removes it.</p> <p><strong>Toxic and Toxic Spikes</strong>: Being poisoned is detrimental to Slowbro's ability to perform as an efficient wall.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Slack Off is Slowbro's best and most reliable recovery move. Always run it on the defensive set, as it prevents Slowbro from being worn down easily and aids it in stalling out its foe. Ice Beam is necessary for Slowbro to be an effective check to Mega Salamence. It inflicts reliable damage, unlike Toxic, which can be cured by Refresh. Ice Beam is also Slowbro's best way of directly damaging Primal Groudon. Toxic is great for crippling opposing walls and stalling out common threats such as Ho-Oh, Groudon, and Arceus, which otherwise would not take any significant damage from Slowbro. Scald is its most reliable Water STAB move, which has a chance to burn the foe, discouraging Pokemon such as Kyogre and Gengar from switching in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Slowbro to tank hits from strong physical attackers, such as Mega Lucario and Mega Salamence. Regenerator is necessary to keep Slowbro alive, as it allows Slowbro to recover a bit of HP every time it switches out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thunder Wave should be used to cripple Choice Scarf users and Speed boosters that would normally outspeed your sweepers, while Toxic can also be used in order to to stall out opposing Pokemon. Scald is a great utility move to potentially burn physical attackers and maximize Slowbro's ability to wall them. Avoid Mega Evolving immediately to take full advantage of Regenerator. Slack Off should be used to stall out Pokemon and healing off damage when needed, but try to utilize Regenerator to the best of your ability to avoid running out of Slack Off PP late-game. Slowbro receives Shell Armor when Mega Evolving, which allows it to stall out Pokemon more efficiently given that it is not prone to critical hits. Try to avoid all special attacks if possible (besides Lava Plume from Groudon), as Slowbro has mediocre Special Defense. Despite Slowbro having outstanding Defense, do not overestimate its bulk. It can still be defeated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ferrothorn forms a fantastic defensive core with Slowbro, as they cover each other's weaknesses flawlessly. Swords Dance Arceus-Ground pairs well with Slowbro, as Slowbro resists both of Arceus-Ground's weaknesses while Arceus is immune to one of Slowbro's. Slowbro's Toxic can cripple some of Arceus's checks such as Lugia, which makes for an easy late-game sweep. A special attacking cleric can remove status ailments inflicted upon Slowbro. Xerneas fulfills this role exceptionally, as it can keep Slowbro from being crippled by status with Aromatherapy. In return, Slowbro can wear down its checks while resisting Xerneas's Steel-type weakness. Defog support is greatly appreciated considering that entry hazards hinder Slowbro's ability to freely switch in and out after losing Regenerator, which makes Latios and Latias outstanding partners for it. Latias pairs especially well with Slowbro, as it can provide Healing Wish support in addition to Defog support.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster is one of the most offensively oriented entry hazard controllers in the tier and requires prediction and very aggressive play in order to keep the field free of entry hazards. Cloyster also has access to Spikes and the coveted Toxic Spikes to further support the team, and it uses its great offensive typing, powerful STAB move in Icicle Spear, and excellent boosting move in Shell Smash to pressure opposing Defoggers and entry hazard setters alike. Cloyster can beat most opposing entry hazard leads, such as Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A, or can outspeed and wear down bulky entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon and Dialga for the next Pokemon to take them out. However, Cloyster dislikes bulky Defoggers that can shrug off its STAB move, such as Arceus and Scizor, and requires a bit of team support to make the most of its niche. Overall, Cloyster is an excellent utility Pokemon that, although it requires very aggressive play, can control entry hazards in your favor and set up your threatening sweepers to put in lots of work.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Because Cloyster has a very defined niche, its moveslots should generally not be changed outside of the options above. However, depending on your team, Cloyster has a few other things it can do to accomplish specific things. Firstly, Hidden Power Fire is an option, as it lets Cloyster beat Defog Scizor and the rare Forretress one-on-one and makes Cloyster a good lure in conjunction with a Pokemon such as Geomancy Xerneas, which appreciates these Steel-types being weakened or removed. Ice Shard is a very niche option that allows Cloyster to revenge kill weakened Mega Salamence or finish off Giratina-O before can use Shadow Sneak, but Cloyster is hard-pressed to find a slot to fit it in. Finally, an Adamant nature can be considered to improve Cloyster's damage output and still let it outspeed most of the Pokemon it has to; for example, Cloyster can still outspeed and has a good chance to OHKO maximum HP-invested Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage. However, Jolly is still preferred in most cases because Cloyster's main role is entry hazard control and it has a smaller chance of losing to arbitrary Speed creep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sleep Leads</strong>: Cloyster's premier counters are opposing sleep leads such as Darkrai and Smeargle, which both outspeed Cloyster and can put it to sleep, preventing it from spinning away or setting up entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Support Arceus formes can tank Cloyster's Icicle Spear while burning Cloyster with Will-O-Wisp and Defogging Cloyster's entry hazards away. Additionally, Arceus-Ghost can reliably spinblock Cloyster, while Arceus-Poison can absorb Cloyster's Toxic Spikes. In a similar vein, Defog Scizor can easily take any of Cloyster's attacks barring the rare Hidden Power Fire and Defog Cloyster's entry hazards away. Some niche entry hazard users, such as Jirachi or Forretress, can beat Cloyster one-on-one while managing to keep their own entry hazards up. On the other hand, niche Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel and Excadrill can also beat Cloyster one-on-one while removing its entry hazards. It is important to maintain offensive pressure on the opponent, as other Defog users such as Latios, Latias, and Giratina can come in after Cloyster faints and use Defog to clear away any entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: While they cannot prevent Cloyster from setting up its entry hazards, any special attacker that can outspeed Cloyster will most likely 2HKO it due to Cloyster's abysmal special bulk, limiting it to one move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Hazard Control": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Cloyster's main niche in Ubers is to provide entry hazard control for your team. Thus, Rapid Spin is a necessity on this set, as well as the entry hazards of your choice, Toxic Spikes or Spikes. Offensively incorporated Toxic Spikes are a big threat in the current meta, as they put a timer on offensive setup sweepers such as ExtremeKiller Arceus and Geomancy Xerneas while hampering bulky Pokemon such as Primal Groudon. However, Spikes can be used if your team requires the immediate extra damage to better punish switches. For a utility Pokemon, Icicle Spear is a great STAB attack, as Skill Link boosts its Base Power to 125 and it has good coverage in Ubers, dealing super effective damage to Giratina, the most common spinblocker. Shell Smash allows Cloyster to aggressively pressure the opposing team, but Explosion can be used to pseudo-spinblock or to deal damage to Pokemon such as Kyogre.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allow Cloyster to optimally fulfill its role, by maximizing Icicle Spear's damage output and letting Cloyster outpace bulky entry hazard users, respectively. With a Jolly Nature, Cloyster can outspeed uninvested Lugia and, after using Shell Smash, the entire unboosted metagame. Focus Sash is the item of choice, as it guarantees a spin or a turn of setup against faster, more powerful foes. It also lets Cloyster act as an emergency check to dangerous setup sweepers such as Mega Salamence and Geomancy Xerneas.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cloyster is typically used as a lead, unless the opponent carries a Pokemon that could prevent Cloyster from accomplishing its role. Key Pokemon to look out for are sleep leads, such as Darkrai and Smeargle, or entry hazard setters that can beat Cloyster, such as the rare Forretress. Cloyster should be played extremely aggressively and switched directly into potential entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon and Dialga to try preserving its Focus Sash. Free turns should be used to set up entry hazards, use Shell Smash, or deal damage with Icicle Spear, depending on the situation. Cloyster should try to deal as much damage as possible to bulky entry hazard setters to the point where your next Pokemon can reliably KO them, thus preventing entry hazards from being set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The premier teammate for Cloyster is Ho-Oh, as it appreciates the offensive entry hazard control Cloyster provides for it. Additionally, Toxic Spikes support can wear down Ho-Oh's checks, such as Arceus-Rock, Primal Groudon, and Zekrom. In return, Ho-Oh can use its Fire-type STAB moves or Earthquake to threaten the Steel-types that Cloyster has trouble with, such as Aegislash and Heatran. Choice Band variants of Ho-Oh can also absorb Dark Void from lead Darkrai, one of the few leads that can beat Cloyster. Primal Groudon is another good teammate for Cloyster, as its STAB moves can hit many entry hazard setters in Ubers super effectively. This makes Groudon a good follow-up Pokemon to take out weakened Dialga, opposing Primal Groudon, Defog Scizor, and more. Groudon also provides Stealth Rock support for your team. In return, Cloyster can use its Ice-type STAB move to beat Groudon's checks, such as Giratina-O, Landorus-T, and Mega Salamence. Finally, ExtremeKiller Arceus is another good teammate for Cloyster, as it appreciates Primal Groudon and Giratina being worn down and the extra entry hazards allow it to secure more KOs.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey is viable in the ORAS Ubers metagame due to the absence of Gothitelle and Taunt Mega Gengar, which otherwise serve as hard counters to it courtesy of Shadow Tag. While Mega Gengar can PP stall Chansey either way, it not running Taunt means that Chansey is not completely helpless against most sets, as it can paralyze them with Thunder Wave before going down, hindering Mega Gengar's use throughout the rest of the match. Chansey fits well on balance builds, as it can sponge a wide variety of special attacks and help spread status ailments. It also has enough physical bulk to take weaker physical blows if need be, unlike Blissey.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Chansey is extremely passive, providing no offensive presence of its own outside of Seismic Toss. Although its physical bulk is not terrible, it still cannot stand up to the physical powerhouses of the tier, such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. What's more, they can come in fairly easily on Chansey and start threatening its team with powerful attacks. Despite Chansey's reputation of being a wall, Blissey actually fits better on stall-oriented teams because it can make better use of Wish and Snatch, fit Heal Bell more easily in its set, and, as a result, support its team more easily. Finally, Chansey is vulnerable to all entry hazards. Chansey can succeed on the right team, but it needs a fair amount of support to make up for its flaws.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sweet Kiss is an interesting move that can allow Chansey to take further advantage of the paralysis it spreads and defeat Mega Gengar lacking Taunt in a one-on-one situation. The lack of accuracy and general mediocrity of confusion as a status condition are a detriment, however. Stealth Rock can free up a slot for Primal Groudon to run a different set, and Chansey can cripple Defog users with status ailments. Counter can be used to surprise Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and support Primal Groudon attempting to inflict severe damage with their physical STAB moves. Bear in mind that none of these moves can be fit onto Chansey's set without making it worse at its primary job as a status-spreading sponge. Chansey should avoid running Wish, as it cannot fit both Wish and Protect onto this set, and Blissey is a superior option for passing large Wishes regardless. Finally, do not ever consider running a special attack on Chansey; with its pathetic base 35 Special Attack stat, even super effective attacks (such as Psychic against Mega Gengar) will not do much damage at all.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Attackers</strong>: The best way of destroying Chansey is with brute force from extremely powerful physical attacks. Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Mega Mewtwo X, and especially Mega Lucario can all deal severe damage to Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag</strong>: Taunt Mega Gengar and Gothitelle completely shut Chansey down, while Will-O-Wisp Mega Gengar PP stalls Chansey. The Taunt variant of Mega Gengar needs to be careful about switching directly into a Thunder Wave, although this does not matter for the Will-O-Wisp variant, as it will be paralyzed anyway due to not having Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Although it can do little back, Mega Sableye stops Chansey from spreading Toxic or Thunder Wave and is immune to Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Spikes users</strong>: Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and to a lesser extent Klefki can use Chansey as an opportunity to set up Spikes. The latter will be worn down quickly from Seismic Toss, however.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Yveltal and Mewtwo stop Chansey from spreading status ailments or using Recover and force it to either switch out or deal unimpressive damage with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Pokemon such as maximum HP Ho-Oh and Substitute + Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost can use Chansey as setup bait, because it cannot break Ho-Oh's Substitute with Seismic Toss and cannot touch Arceus-Ghost at all. Some uncommon users of Substitute, such as Xerneas, also avoid having their Substitutes broken by Seismic Toss but have a harder time breaking through Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as RestTalk Geomancy Xerneas and Refresh variants of Calm Mind Arceus avoid getting 3HKOed by Seismic Toss and can heal off status, so they can set up on Chansey very easily.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance Arceus formes</strong>: Swords Dance Arceus-Ground is immune to Thunder Wave and deals hefty damage to Chansey after a boost, whereas Extreme Killer Arceus can deal with status fairly well and break through Chansey after accruing a couple of boosts. Both will be worn down by the time they defeat Chansey, however. Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost is immune to Seismic Toss but deals with Thunder Wave and Toxic significantly worse than the other two viable Swords Dance Arceus formes.</p>",

Toxic punishes Pokemon that would otherwise beat Chansey, such as offensive Primal Groudon and Choice Band Ho-Oh, and helps Chansey stall out special attackers that cannot break through it, such as Darkrai and Calm Mind Arceus formes without Refresh. However, if you feel your team requires cleric support, Heal Bell can be used over Toxic. Soft-Boiled is used to keep Chansey healthy, especially since this set cannot fit both Protect and Wish. Finally, Seismic Toss is used to give Chansey some offensive presence to prevent it from being complete setup bait. It can quickly wear down Pokemon such as Klefki and Shaymin-S but struggles to stop any Substitute user capable of setting up a 101 HP Substitute, such as Ho-Oh or Arceus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Chansey invests in its defenses rather than its HP to maximize both its physical and special bulk. A Bold nature is used to further bolster its much weaker Defense so that it can reliably take on weaker physical attacks when need be. The only item that should be used on Chansey is Eviolite; without the extra bulk it provides, Blissey would outclass Chansey completely. Natural Cure is the ability Chansey should use to cure status ailments as it switches out.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Chansey does such a good job of absorbing special attacks, it can switch in liberally on special attackers such as Xerneas, Calm Mind Arceus formes lacking Refresh, and Yveltal lacking Taunt. Watch out for stallbreaking sets such as Rest Geomancy Xerneas and the aforementioned Refresh Arceus formes; they can use Chansey as setup bait, so it is a good idea to go into another check to these Pokemon for scouting before sending in Chansey. Once Chansey switches in on a special attacker it can check easily, it should aim to spread status ailments to support its team. If you expect a Primal Groudon switching in, use Toxic; if you expect Mega Gengar or a fast sweeper capable of damaging Chansey such as Calm Mind Latios, use Thunder Wave. It is advised to use Soft-Boiled liberally to keep Chansey healthy, as it can get worn out rather quickly by a combination of weak attacks, status, and entry hazards.</p> <p>There are times when it is a good idea to be more aggressive with Thunder Wave than usual. For example, if your opponent has a Mega Lucario and Chansey is relatively low on health, your opponent will probably use that turn to get Mega Lucario in for free on the predicted Soft-Boiled. Mega Gengar is another Pokemon that will often attempt to come in, especially the uncommon Taunt variant. Chansey can punish aggressive play very easily with a well-timed Thunder Wave. Also, do note that while Chansey can pivot in on Primal Kyogre's Origin Pulse and Deoxys-A's Psycho Boost, it must beware of Primal Kyogre's physical set and Deoxys-A's Superpower.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can reflect or remove entry hazards, such as Mega Diancie, Giratina-O, and Latios, can assuage Chansey's weakness to them. The latter two Pokemon can also check dangerous Fighting-types such as Mega Lucario and Mega Mewtwo X. Chansey has a terrible matchup with Primal Groudon, so reliable checks to that Pokemon, such as Lugia and support Arceus-Ground, are mandatory. Arceus-Rock and Lugia can also deal with other physical threats, such as Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence. Because Chansey is used on balance, you will often have at least one setup sweeper that can take advantage of the status that Chansey spreads. Swords Dance Arceus-Ground and Calm Mind Arceus-Rock enjoy paralysis support while checking Pokemon Chansey is weak to, such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, respectively. Finally, if you are worried about Taunt Mega Gengar, you can use a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar or Aegislash to remove it.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Kangaskhan's decent base 100 Speed tier combined with a wide movepool that gives it the ability to run a multitude of sets allows it to put pressure on offensive and defensive teams alike. Because of this, it has the ability to easily influence matchup at the cost of coverage, an issue that should be addressed when building with it. Its ability, Parental Bond, has the added benefit of effectively giving Kangaskhan a Choice Band without locking it into a move. However, Kangaskhan has a relatively low base Attack stat for a Mega Evolution and struggles to break through common walls.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Wish support set can be run with Body Slam and Seismic Toss to increase longevity, making it easier to break through walls. Mud-Slap and Rest can also be run to ease playing against defensive teams that rely on status. Fire Punch is an option on the main set to OHKO Ferrothorn while retaining coverage on Skarmory and Klefki. Rock Tomb or Bulldoze can be used to discourage setup sweepers that rely on boosting their Speed, such as Xerneas and Mega Salamence.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: With an immunity to Kangaskhan's STAB attacks and access to Will-O-Wisp, Mega Gengar can trap it and either cripple it with Will-O-Wisp in order to avoid the KO from Crunch or deal massive damage with Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Mega Sableye is immune to Fighting and Normal coverage moves, and with its high physical bulk it can switch into any of Kangaskhan's attacks and status it. Giratina-O can take any hit and either cripple Mega Kangaskhan with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp or phaze it with Dragon Tail, although it needs to watch out for Crunch and Ice Punch. Arceus-Ghost can switch into anything barring Crunch and burn Kangaskhan with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Arceus Formes</strong>: Support Arceus variants can counter all Kangaskhan sets barring Power-Up Punch or Body Slam / Seismic Toss sets, being able to switch into its unboosted STAB attacks and wear it down with status.</p> <p><strong>Mega Lucario</strong>: Mega Lucario resists all of Kangaskhan's priority and can outspeed it and OHKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory can take any of Mega Kangaskhan's hits and completely walls non-Seismic Toss / Fire Punch sets.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Rock- and Steel-types</strong>: Rock-types, such as Arceus-Rock and Tyranitar, can switch into any hit except Earthquake or Low Kick and either inflict Kangaskhan with paralysis or burn or use a utility move such as Defog or Stealth Rock. Additionally, Steel-types, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, can take any hit and poison Kangaskhan or set entry hazards; however, they have to beware of sets carrying Fire Punch.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out is mandatory to ensure a safe Mega Evolution and deals decent damage with STAB and Parental Bond, being able to get vital chip damage on threats. Return is the main STAB move with 102 Base Power and can 2HKO or OHKO most Pokemon that do not resist it after a bit of prior damage. Alternatively, Body Slam can be used in this slot for its 51% paralysis chance, allowing Kangaskhan to muscle through some of its defensive checks, such as support Arceus formes. Crunch is the preferred option in the third slot, hitting the Ghost-types that are immune to Kangaskhan's STAB attacks, such as Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, Mega Gengar, and Lugia; it also comes with a nifty 36% chance to lower the target's Defense. Power-Up Punch in the last slot allows Kangaskhan to break through defensive walls that rely on status and longevity to deal with it, such as Skarmory and support Arceus, and avoid becoming setup fodder for Mega Salamence switching in after a boost. Another option for the last slot is Seismic Toss, which can surprise opposing Pokemon, 2HKOing Skarmory and Ferrothorn as they switch in, and should be used if running Body Slam as well. Nevertheless, Mega Kangaskhan is by no means limited to these move options, given its expansive movepool. Double-Edge can be run as the primary STAB attack for more immediate power at the cost of longevity. Ice Punch can be run in the third slot, allowing Kangaskhan to fish for freezes on Lugia while retaining coverage on Giratina-O and not allowing Kangaskhan to become setup bait for Mega Salamence. However, it should not be run simultaneously with Crunch due to their redundancy. Earthquake, Low Kick, and Sucker Punch are all additional options for the fourth moveslot. Earthquake can be used to hit the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return, notably Tyranitar, Klefki, and Arceus-Rock, as well as being Kangaskhan's best option to hit Primal Groudon and Mega Gengar. Low Kick OHKOes Dialga and prevents Extreme Killer Arceus from setting up. Finally, Sucker Punch is notable for its effectiveness against offense and use as a secondary form of priority to pick off weakened attackers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Scrappy is the preferred ability pre-Mega Evolution, allowing Kangaskhan to hit Ghost-types with its STAB attacks. Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Kangaskhan to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed most support Arceus formes. A Jolly nature can be used instead to outspeed Excadrill, Rayquaza, and maximum Speed Ho-Oh. Finally, 80 EVs can be shifted from Speed to Defense to avoid the OHKO from Jolly Life Orb Extreme Killer's +2 Extreme Speed, as well as an unboosted Precipice Blades from maximum Attack Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock, while still outspeeding neutral base 90s.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With access to Fake Out, Kangaskhan can be used to antilead against many offensive teams that utilize a suicide lead. Fake Out can also be used repeatedly to wear down setup sweepers and can let Mega Kangaskhan perform as a last-resort check to the likes of Xerneas by switching out and back in after you sacrifice something. Body Slam in conjunction with Seismic Toss can allow Mega Kangaskhan to deal with the support Arceus formes that otherwise easily check it by first paralyzing them and then spamming Seismic Toss. However, if the opponent has Pokemon that could deal recoil damage, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, using Seismic Toss first is usually the best option. Crunch should be used if expecting a switch into a Ghost-type and Ice Punch can be used to fish for freezes on Lugia. If running Power-Up Punch, boost on something that does not threaten Mega Kangaskhan, such as non-Rocky Helmet Skarmory, or on a predicted switch. As Kangaskhan's bulk is nothing impressive, avoid switching it in directly on attacks, but keep in mind it can survive most unboosted neutrally effective moves from full. Try to bring it in via a double switch or when you expect your opponent to go for a recovery or utility move. Keep it away from status, as burn and paralysis make it effectively useless and poison greatly reduces its longevity and makes using Fake Out a liability.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with the ability to set Toxic Spikes, such as Cloyster and Scolipede, make great partners, as Kangaskhan can rack up residual poison damage with Fake Out. Dark-types such as Arceus-Dark, Yveltal, and Darkrai are notable for their ability to pressure the Ghost-types that are immune to Kangaskhan's STAB attacks and are especially helpful if it is not carrying Crunch. Additionally, Pokemon to break through or cripple bulky walls such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and support Arceus formes, such as Lava Plume Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Hex users, are greatly appreciated. However, Body Slam / Seismic Toss variants can break through the aforementioned walls as well, while Fire Punch roasts specially defensive Skarmory and Ferrothorn. If Mega Kangaskhan is not carrying Earthquake or Low Kick, Pokemon to deal with Rock- and Steel-types, such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Landorus-T, make good partners. Also helpful are Pokemon that deal with Kangaskhan's offensive answers, such as Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Ground, and Xerneas.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mega Gyarados has carved a niche for itself in this metagame thanks to Mold Breaker, which is excellent against users of Multiscale, Sturdy, and Magic Bounce and thus makes it an answer to defensive teams. It's also decent versus hyper offensive teams because it works as a secondary check to Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ghost, having access to Intimidate and a Ground immunity before Mega Evolving. Finally, its decent 95 / 109 / 130 bulk and sheer physical power given by a base 155 Attack stat greatly help it fulfill its duties. However, Mega Gyarados is vulnerable to Xerneas and Mega Salamence, both very popular Pokemon. It also removes the possibility of running Mega Salamence, which is much better against hyper and bulky offensive teams. Lastly, it does not contribute to the defensive synergy of the team outside of checking offensive Arceus-Ghost and some variants of Primal Groudon; it even has to be cautious of the latter's Lava Plume.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using Ice Fang over Earthquake is a decent option to beat Mega Salamence, and Mega Gyarados will still be able to break stall teams with Taunt and Mold Breaker; however, this makes it weak to Klefki. Aqua Tail can be used to OHKO Ho-Oh and Mega Diancie without any boost as well as Arceus-Ground at +1. However, do note that even with Mold Breaker, Aqua Tail doesn't bypass Desolate Land.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas resists Crunch, while Earthquake is not powerful enough to defeat it. Xerneas will then proceed to KO Mega Gyarados with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Mega Salamence is bulky enough to take hits from Mega Gyarados, especially after cutting its Attack with Intimidate. It can then set up because it's faster than Mega Gyarados and proceed to hit it really hard.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Grass and Arceus-Fairy</strong>: Both Arceus-Grass and Arceus-Fairy completely wall Mega Gyarados and 2HKO it with STAB Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Klefki</strong>: Klefki cripples Mega Gyarados with priority Thunder Wave and thus stops its sweep. Mega Gyarados can KO it with Earthquake, though.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Teams</strong>: While Gyarados is a secondary Primal Groudon check, it can't really switch into anything else.</p>",

      "Offensive Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crunch is used as Mega Gyarados's main STAB move because it hits a lot of Pokemon for neutral or super effective damage. Earthquake is mainly used to hit Primal Groudon and Klefki hard as well as anything that resists Crunch. Taunt is useful to avoid status moves and phazing and to stop Xerneas from setting up. Lastly, Dragon Dance boosts Mega Gyarados's Attack and Speed, making it an even more threatening Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack EVs are used to deal maximum damage even without a boost. An Adamant nature is needed to OHKO Lugia and 2HKO defensive Arceus formes at +2 with Crunch. Maximum EVs in Speed allow Mega Gyarados to outspeed Darkrai and Shaymin at +1. Running a Jolly nature is an option to outspeed Mega Gengar and Mewtwo at +1. Intimidate should be used as the initial ability because it provides utility versus hyper offense. Lastly, Mold Breaker as a post-Mega Evolution ability helps Mega Gyarados break through common abilities such as Magic Bounce, Multiscale, and Sturdy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When playing against a stall team, make sure to bring Gyarados in safely without letting it get hit by a status move. Furthermore, never use Dragon Dance until an opposing Sableye has Mega Evolved because its base forme has Prankster and Will-O-Wisp. When playing against a hyper offensive team, it's not easy to sweep with Mega Gyarados because of how common Xerneas and Mega Salamence are on these teams, so just save it to check Primal Groudon and offensive Arceus-Ghost. Against Primal Groudon, try playing around Lava Plume and Thunder Wave instead of directly switching Mega Gyarados into it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Gyarados shines on balanced and bulky offensive teams. It should be paired with solid Xerneas checks such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Klefki, as well as solid Mega Salamence checks such as defensive Arceus formes. It's very important that other team members cover Mega Gyarados's weakness to hyper offensive and bulky offensive teams, as Mega Gyarados can only take care of stall and some balanced teams. Finally, Extreme Killer Arceus performs well versus offense and Mega Gyarados takes care of its checks, such as Giratina, Lugia, and Arceus-Ghost.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto carves a small, yet unique, niche in the Ubers metagame: its ability Imposter allows it to completely copy the foe, including stats with the exception of HP, ability, and any boosts that have been acquired. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Ditto is able to completely deter setup on the opposing team and revenge kill Pokemon that have already acquired boosts, such as Xerneas, Rock Polish Primal Groudon, and weakened Extreme Killer Arceus. Furthermore, Ditto doesn't necessarily have to revenge kill - it can scout for moves using Imposter to potentially give you the advantage. However, Ditto can easily be played around. Because Ditto copies the opposing Pokemon's moveset, the opponent can potentially predict what Ditto will use and play around it. Furthermore, Ditto is completely useless against stall teams and support Pokemon such as support Arceus formes and Mega Sableye, as it can't make use of their moves well; it is usually only effective against hyper offense, where the opponent does not have checks for everything. Ditto is also ineffective against Substitute users, as it cannot transform into a Pokemon behind a Substitute. To compound this all, Ditto's low HP means that it can easily be worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>In terms of moves, Ditto literally has no other options, as Transform is its only available move. However, you could opt for another item over a Choice Scarf. Leftovers provide Ditto with more longevity, Life Orb adds that extra oomph when attacking, and a Focus Sash guarantees a safe attack if Ditto isn't damaged ahead of time. However, these are all inferior to the Choice Scarf, as Ditto will be relying on a Speed tie to revenge kill the foe. The IVs of Ditto can be adjusted to give a different Hidden Power, as long as they utilize minimal Speed IVs. Generally, it comes down to what a team needs.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Ditto cannot Transform into a Pokemon behind a Substitute, thus stopping it from doing anything.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Teams</strong>: Ditto serves as a revenge killer to offensive teams. Against defensive teams, Ditto isn't able to OHKO the foe and will usually be stalled out effectively.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Any status will make it harder for Ditto to revenge kill. A burn halves its Attack, making it bad as physical revenge killer. Paralysis stops Ditto from outspeeding the foe. Poison puts a timer on Ditto, while being put to sleep and being frozen both stop Ditto from moving.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Arceus</strong>: Ditto can rarely revenge kill Calm Mind Arceus due to its great bulk and access to Recover, while Calm Mind Arceus easily outlasts Ditto.</p>",

      "Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is the only move Ditto actually learns, and it never finds use due to Imposter doing the exact same thing without Ditto having to actively use it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Imposter gives Ditto its niche and allows it to completely copy the foe. A Choice Scarf is used so Ditto can always outpace the Pokemon it transformed into and proceed to revenge kill them with ease. 248 HP EVs are used because HP is the only stat that isn't copied over and these maximize Ditto's HP stat so it can take hits marginally better. 252 Defense EVs are used solely used in order to take minimal damage in the rare situation of a Struggle war with an opposing Ditto. A Relaxed nature further boosts Defense while also lowering Speed, so Ditto can outslow opposing Ditto in the case of said Struggle war. 0 Speed IVs lower Speed even more and give the IVs for Hidden Power Ice so Ditto can hit Rayquaza and similar foes super effectively, in the case Ditto transforms into a foe that has Hidden Power. The IVs for Hidden Power Ground, 30 Def / 30 SpA / 1 Spe, are an option if you aim to copy a weakened Xerneas and beat its checks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ditto best serves as a revenge killer to threats that have already set up, such as Geomancy Xerneas. Late-game, it can potentially copy an opposing sweeper and continue a sweep. Ditto has pitiful defenses before it transforms, so it should always be brought in safely; a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is your best means, but you can even bring it in after a teammate has fainted. Ditto can also be used for scouting the foe's moves, allowing you to play around them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Generally, Ditto is a glue for offensive teams that are weak to setup sweepers, and usually it will function on its own. However, Ditto makes good use of entry hazard removal, as it usually finds itself switching in and out often. The best partners for this job are Giratina-O, Latios, and Latias, all of which fit well on offense teams and have access to Defog. Wallbreakers such as Kyogre make for great partners, as they can severely weaken Pokemon that Ditto cannot easily revenge kill, such as Calm Mind Arceus. However, entry hazard support is also an option to somewhat weaken foes.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Aerodactyl is an excellent fit on offensive teams due to its blazing Speed stat that works well with its access to Stealth Rock and Taunt. These attributes allow Mega Aerodactyl to set up Stealth Rock and prevent Defog users from removing it so long as Mega Aerodactyl is out, which makes it a good fit on Spikes-stacking teams. Because Mega Aerodactyl gets excellent coverage with Stone Edge and Earthquake, it can easily afford to run both Stealth Rock and Taunt. Aerodactyl also possesses the ability to revenge kill fast offensive threats, such as Mewtwo and Darkrai, while checking Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence. Unfortunately, Mega Aerodactyl is relatively weak by Ubers standards and will have a difficult time 2HKOing the majority of the metagame. It is also not bulky enough to survive more than one strong neutral hit from Pokemon such as Xerneas and Mega Gengar. Because of its frailty and its Stealth Rock weakness, there is a good chance that Aerodactyl will not last more than one turn if it is conserved for the mid-game. Mega Aerodactyl also cannot be used with Mega Salamence or Mega Gengar.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulky set with Pursuit and Roost over Stealth Rock and Earthquake is viable on more defensively oriented teams that want an answer to Mega Gengar while serving as a more sturdy Ho-Oh check. This set should still run 216 Speed EVs to outrun Darkrai before Mega Evolving, but should run maximum HP instead of maximum Attack while putting the leftover EVs in Defense. Mega Aerodactyl can also attempt to use moves that take advantage of its ability, Tough Claws. Of these, Fire Fang is the most intriguing due to its ability to potentially OHKO Ferrothorn and hit Klefki and Aegislash very hard. Aerial Ace is also an option to deal with Mega Mewtwo X. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Arceus and Primal Groudon, but the combination of Taunt and Mega Aerodactyl's attacks is generally enough to pressure these threats anyway. Tailwind is an option to give slow, powerful attackers such as Life Orb Zekrom and Choice Band Ho-Oh a temporary Speed boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl does not come close to 2HKOing Mega Sableye with Stone Edge and Mega Sableye prevents Mega Aerodactyl from setting up Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Mega Sableye can also burn Mega Aerodactyl or 2HKO it with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Spinners</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl cannot stop Rapid Spin users from removing entry hazards by itself. Although the Mega Aerodactyl user can switch out to a spinblocker, this can give Forretress an opportunity to set up an entry hazard of its own. Life Orb Excadrill under sand can outrun and OHKO Mega Aerodactyl with Iron Head and 2HKO Arceus-Ghost with a combination of Iron Head and Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that beat Mega Aerodactyl 1v1</strong>: Many Pokemon in Ubers can easily beat Mega Aerodactyl, but not many can stop it from at least setting up Stealth Rock and therefore accomplishing its main goal. Primal Kyogre, Zekrom, Life Orb Dialga, and Arceus-Rock are examples of Pokemon that can OHKO Mega Aerodactyl and prevent it from doing anything other than setting up Stealth Rock, assuming Mega Aerodactyl stays in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Prehistoric Beast (Offensive)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl is a terrific Stealth Rock setter, as it possesses the Speed and defensive typing to reliably set up the entry hazard. It can keep up Stealth Rock, as well as any other entry hazard on your opponent's side of the field, by using Taunt against Defog users; Taunt can also be used to stop an opposing sweeper from setting up. Stone Edge is Mega Aerodactyl's most powerful viable STAB move and 2HKOes offensively inclined Pokemon such as Darkrai, Mega Mewtwo Y, Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, and Latios. It also allows Mega Aerodactyl to check Ho-Oh effectively. Rock Slide is an alternative option if you want to check Ho-Oh more reliably, but the power drop is significant and the extra PP afforded by Rock Slide is rarely beneficial. Earthquake provides excellent neutral coverage alongside Stone Edge and smacks Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Klefki, Aegislash, and Jirachi for good damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread lets Mega Aerodactyl outrun Darkrai before Mega Evolving, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to Taunt it before it can use Dark Void. Mega Aerodactyl can also outrun neutral-natured base 90 Speed Choice Scarf users after Mega Evolving, allowing it to reliably revenge kill weakened Pokemon such as Zekrom. Although Jolly Mega Aerodactyl does not hit that hard, even with maximum Attack investment, the Speed is invaluable for hyper offensive teams that struggle with lead Darkrai without the Speed investment. The leftovers EVs are placed into HP to increase Mega Aerodactyl's overall bulk a little.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Mega Aerodactyl is an adequate lead, it is often a good idea to save it for the early- or mid-game to check Ho-Oh, revenge kill weakened Pokemon, and set up Stealth Rock when the opportunity arises. If your opponent has Lugia, however, set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible, as offensive teams will have a hard time breaking it without Stealth Rock up. Once Mega Aerodactyl sets up Stealth Rock, feel free to use Taunt on both walls and setup sweepers alike in order to give whatever teammate comes in after Mega Aerodactyl faints an advantageous situation. Although Earthquake is useful for hitting certain Steel-types and dealing some damage against Primal Groudon, Mega Aerodactyl often won't have time to use it. Bear in mind that Mega Aerodactyl can clean up severely weakened teams late-game, but it isn't strong enough to sweep reliably. Stone Edge's accuracy can also be detrimental, especially if Mega Aerodactyl needs to hit with it several times in a row in order to sweep. Therefore, it is almost always okay to sacrifice Mega Aerodactyl after it has done its job, especially if it uses Taunt the turn it faints.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Custap Berry Forretress can set up entry hazards for Mega Aerodactyl to keep up with Taunt while spinning away Stealth Rock. Cloyster is another good entry hazard setter that can keep Stealth Rock off the field, which Mega Aerodactyl is weak to. Although Cloyster has more offensive presence and has an easier time beating spinblockers than Forretress does, it does not have access to Sturdy, which forces it to run Focus Sash over Custap Berry. Because of this, Forretress has an easier time setting up two entry hazards against offensive teams than Cloyster does. Deoxys-A is another option to set up a layer or two of Spikes. A spinblocker is a good idea in conjunction with Mega Aerodactyl, but Giratina-O and Giratina are not recommended because they don't pressure common Defog users enough. Therefore, Swords Dance and Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost are quality options to block Rapid Spin while severely pressuring Defog users. If you opt for the Calm Mind set, maximize Special Attack to deal as much damage as possible. Arceus-Ghost and Mega Aerodactyl also provide two solid checks to Extreme Killer Arceus, which many hyper offensive teams are weak to.</p> <p>Mega Aerodactyl also needs threatening teammates to take advantage of its ability to keep up entry hazards. Geomancy Xerneas, Rock Polish Primal Groudon, and Dragon Dance Rayquaza all appreciate entry hazard support while punishing any attempt to remove entry hazards with offensive pressure. Other Taunt users, such as Darkrai and Mewtwo, are also a good idea to stop Defog and potentially give a teammate such as Xerneas an opportunity to set up.</p>"

  "Mewtwo": {
    "overview": "<p>Mewtwo has exceptionally high base offensive stats and two separate Mega Evolutions which grant it great versatility and unpredictability to the point where it is nearly impossible to counter before its forme is revealed. Furthermore, Mewtwo sits at a Speed tier where it can outspeed the majority of the unboosted Ubers metagame bar some Deoxys formes. It also has access to a wide movepool, with many viable coverage moves in addition to moves such as Taunt and Calm Mind, which further its versatility. Mewtwo's abilities, while not particularly great, are all situationally useful. All this makes Mewtwo a formidable mid-game Pokemon that can break down opposing teams, with the potential to clean late-game as well. However, in spite of sky-high offenses, Mewtwo's attacks fall short of a lot of important OHKOs, and its typing leaves much to be desired defensively, being a bit lacking in useful resistances. Nevertheless, Mewtwo is a frighteningly versatile and powerful offensive monster in the Ubers metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mewtwo has a lot of other sets and moves that further its versatility. Stalltwo, a Mewtwo set with Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Psystrike, and Recover, can be used, but it struggles in a metagame dominated by Primal Groudon. Bulk Up Mega Mewtwo X can be run for a nice way to boost Attack and Defense, coupled with a powerful Drain Punch to regain HP and improve longevity. Substitute can be used on either a physical or special set to ease prediction and block status. Mewtwo also has a lot of potential coverage moves such as Thunder, Hurricane, and the elemental punches. Self-Destruct is another useful move that is able to prevent Latias and Latios from using Defog, but it fails to stop other Defog users, specifically Giratina-O, Salamence, and Arceus. A bulky Calm Mind set with Recover is plausible, as it provides more setup opportunities in addition to increased longevity. A Choice Scarf set is also usable and can revenge kill very fast threats such as a +1 Salamence. Mewtwo also has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, so a set utilizing both of those can be useful, especially in conjunction with Taunt and Self-Destruct. A special set with Mewtwonite X can work too, as the secondary Fighting type allows for a much more powerful STAB Focus Blast and neutrality to Dark-type moves such as Yveltal's Sucker Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Arceus-Ghost</strong>: Arceus-Ghost is probably the closest thing to a reliable counter to most Mewtwo variants. It is not 2HKOed by any unboosted attack, bar the relatively uncommon Shadow Ball, and can recover off damage while threatening back with a super effective Judgment. However, with Stealth Rock up or a bit of prior damage, Arceus-Ghost risks being 2HKOed if it switches into Psystrike.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O can switch in on most of Mewtwo's attacks and threaten back with a super effective Shadow Sneak. It is susceptible to being worn down by repeated attacks and entry hazard damage, however.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Yveltal struggles to switch in on Low Kick and Ice Beam, but once in safely and in good health, it can threaten Mewtwo with a powerful Sucker Punch, Dark Pulse, Oblivion Wing, or even Foul Play. It is also immune to Psystrike, so it can come in on that move in particular with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: By virtue of typing, Aegislash can resist a lot of Mewtwo's attacks. It can also threaten back with a powerful Gyro Ball or Shadow Sneak. It must be wary of Earthquake from the physical set and Fire Blast from the special set, but it can still check these variants at least once.</p> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: Sableye can avoid the 2HKO from all of Mewtwo's attacks, and its typing grants it immunities to both of Mewtwo's STAB moves. Furthermore, it is able to bounce back Taunt with Magic Bounce and spam Recover. With that being said, it cannot beat Calm Mind Mewtwo, as it will be overwhelmed by a +1 Mewtwo. Furthermore, Sableye can lose with a bit of prior damage or entry hazard damage.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Dark</strong>: Arceus-Dark's typing lets it check the Special Attacker set and set up Calm Minds relatively well while threatening back with a Judgment. However, Mewtwo frequently runs powerful Fighting-type moves, such as Focus Blast and Low Kick, which will hit Arceus-Dark extremely hard, with the former dealing a minimum of 74% damage with a Life Orb and the latter having a good chance to outright OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Arceus-Psychic can wall most Mewtwo variants but cannot do much in return, and it loses to Taunt and Calm Mind. Lugia similarly can wall Mewtwo but cannot threaten it. Lugia can potentially Toxic stall Mewtwo, but it will be stopped completely by Taunt if it lacks Dragon Tail or Aeroblast for Mega Mewtwo X. Deoxys-D takes hits well and can set Spikes and possibly fire off a status move, but it is shut down by Taunt. Wobbuffet can deal with Mewtwo well with its select movepool, using Encore to prevent setup and being able to hit Mewtwo with Mirror Coat or Counter. It cannot beat the rare Stalltwo, but it beats most other variants. Latias and Latios can tank hits fairly well, but Ice Punch from Mega Mewtwo X hurts a lot.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types</strong>: Arceus-Fairy is able to take on Mewtwo decently well, not fearing too much and possibly OHKOing Mega Mewtwo X, though it does not do very much against the special set. Xerneas can beat Mega Mewtwo X with the exception of rare Iron Tail or Poison Jab variants, though it struggles to beat special variants. Klefki is notable because it can come in on most of Mewtwo's attacks and cripple it with a Thunder Wave, but it will be severely weakened in the process, especially if Mewtwo is running Earthquake or Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mewtwo can outspeed the majority of the unboosted Ubers metagame, but most Choice Scarf users, such as Genesect, can outspeed and revenge kill Mewtwo. Additionally, priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kangaskhan and Yveltal or Extreme Speed from Arceus can revenge kill Mewtwo. Additionally, due to being one of the few Pokemon in the Ubers metagame boasting higher base Speed than Mewtwo, Deoxys-A can effectively revenge kill Mewtwo, as it has Knock Off to deal with Life Orb Mewtwo and Mega Mewtwo Y variants and Psycho Boost to beat Mega Mewtwo X. However, Knock Off only has a chance to OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: In general, Mewtwo dislikes being crippled by status. Specifically, paralysis renders Mewtwo's excellent Speed stat useless, while the physical set also hates being burned and having its Attack stat halved.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psystrike serves as the obligatory STAB move, dealing a lot of damage to neutral foes and circumventing dedicated special walls. Fire Blast allows Mewtwo to roast Steel-types that resist Psystrike, including Aegislash, Ferrothorn, Scizor, Jirachi, and Klefki. Ice Beam hits Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, Yveltal, and Lugia for super effective damage, while Shadow Ball is also a potential move which helps Mewtwo against Lugia, Aegislash, and Arceus-Ghost. Electro Ball hits Mega Sableye extremely hard, OHKOing it after a Calm Mind boost, but has no other targets otherwise. Calm Mind can be used as a setup move which can significantly pressure many teams, as a +1 Psystrike smashes most neutral foes and makes Mewtwo difficult to stop in conjunction with its high base Speed. Taunt can be used over it to avoid status such as paralysis, annoy support Pokemon, and match up well against bulkier stall and balance teams in general. Alternatively, Focus Blast allows Mewtwo to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Dialga and Dark-types such as Arceus-Dark, Tyranitar, and Darkrai super effectively, but its poor accuracy makes it an inferior choice.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is used to take advantage of Mewtwo's great Speed tier. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Mewtwo's offensive capabilities, allowing it to most efficiently fulfill its role as a fast, strong special attacker. Investing 4 Defense EVs gives Mewtwo a minimal buffer against physical attacks, though this is mostly insignificant and can also go in Special Defense. It is worth noting that investing in Special Defense on the Life Orb set will give Genesect an Attack boost, which may not be desired. Life Orb is the optimal item to be used with four attacks on Mewtwo; however, Mewtwonite Y is the better item for Taunt and Calm Mind sets. Mega Mewtwo Y's ability, Insomnia, gives it an immunity to Darkrai's Dark Void and Smeargle's Spore, which is something to keep in mind.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When using Mewtwo, it is best to try to get it in safely, as it is not especially bulky. In fact, Mega Mewtwo Y's physical bulk is notably lacking, and damage can add up quickly for the Life Orb variant if it is forced to take too many hits. Mewtwo works very effectively in the mid-game to weaken checks for another Pokemon, and it can also clean late-game itself. If running Taunt, it should be used liberally against support Pokemon to prevent recovery, support moves such as Defog, and status moves, which Mewtwo dislikes, especially paralysis. It can be an effective strategy to delay Mewtwo's Mega Evolution if running Mewtwonite Y, as Mewtwo's base forme has a higher base Defense. With that being said, it is vital to weigh the importance of having a higher base Speed and Special Defense. In general, Mewtwo has trouble outright OHKOing a fair number of targets, so using the appropriate coverage move and getting prior damage on opposing Pokemon can be essential to Mewtwo's success.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types, such as Klefki and Xerneas, are good partners for Mewtwo, as it appreciates Dark-type Pokemon being checked. Xerneas especially appreciates that Mewtwo can weaken or remove a lot of its Steel-type checks, which allows it to be effective late-game. Similarly, Extreme Killer Arceus appreciates Mewtwo weakening its Ghost-type checks. Dark-types, such as Arceus-Dark, Darkrai, and Yveltal, can check Ghost-types which threaten Mewtwo. Because Mewtwo does not enjoy taking hits throughout the course of a battle, tanks and bulky pivots that can take hits for Mewtwo pair well with it. For example, physically defensive sets for both Yveltal and Salamence can sponge attacks nicely. Finally, Volt Switch and U-turn can grant Mewtwo free switches, so users of these moves make for good teammates. Genesect, Scizor, and Yveltal can all use U-turn, while Zekrom is a viable user of Volt Switch.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Low Kick is a powerful STAB move that reliably hits with 120 Base Power thanks to the general weight of the Pokemon in the Ubers metagame. Taunt allows for a way to block Will-O-Wisp, paralysis, and other status, or force out some walls that may threaten to stop Mewtwo. Earthquake is a nice coverage move to hit Aegislash and Groudon pretty hard, as well as Mega Gengar and some Steel- and Rock-types which are neutral to Low Kick or very light such as Jirachi, Klefki, and Diancie, respectively. Ice Punch hits Flying-types such as Salamence, Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Lugia; bulky Ground-types such as Landorus-T; and Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O for super effective damage. Ice Beam can be used instead of Ice Punch in order to hit Salamence harder, but it is significantly weaker against Latias and Latios. Stone Edge hits the aforementioned Flying-types and also can OHKO Ho-Oh. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge for more accuracy, as it still OHKOes most Ho-Oh variants. Zen Headbutt is a possible secondary STAB move which achieves pretty solid coverage with Low Kick, but it does not target many specific threats. Finally, Poison Jab or Iron Tail can be used for Fairy-types, though they are ineffective move options outside of this.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature and 112 Attack EVs are run in order to take advantage of Mega Mewtwo X's sky-high 190 Attack stat and great Speed tier. 144 Defense EVs give Mewtwo a significant increase to physical bulk, allowing it to survive a +2 Extreme Speed from Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock damage, assuming that Mewtwo has Mega Evolved already. If Mega Mewtwo X elects to use Ice Beam, a Naive nature should be run. The item choice of Mewtwonite X is self-explanatory and necessary to access Mega Mewtwo X's typing and stats, which greatly differ from those of the base forme. An alternate spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used to allow Mega Mewtwo X to hit as hard as possible at the expense of reliably checking Extreme Killer Arceus. The ability Steadfast, which Mewtwo gains upon Mega Evolution, does have a small niche in giving Mewtwo a Speed boost when Choice Scarf variants of both Genesect and Shaymin-S cause it to flinch, after which it avoids further flinches from these Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Taunt should be used against support Pokemon to prevent Defog, recovery, status, and other support moves so Mewtwo's team can keep up its entry hazards and help overwhelm and weaken Pokemon so that a teammate might be able to clean or sweep later on. The type change when Mega Evolving can catch some threats off-guard, as Mewtwo gains neutrality to Dark- and Bug-type moves as well as a resistance to Rock, which can be advantageous when timed properly. Try to maintain and take advantage of Mewtwo's unpredictability to net a surprise KO or two, as the checks for Mewtwo's sets greatly differ, meaning that many can be caught off-guard by a strong physical attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Checks to Fairy-types are important partners, as this Mewtwo variant is especially weak to them. These include Groudon, Ho-Oh, Klefki, Aegislash, and Jirachi. Dark-types, such as Arceus-Dark, Darkrai, and Yveltal, are useful to check Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Geomancy Xerneas and Extreme Killer Arceus are great offensive partners which both benefit from Mewtwo's ability to weaken their checks. Again, U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Genesect, Scizor, Yveltal, and Zekrom give Mewtwo free switches, which it can capitalize on.</p>"

  "Wobbuffet": {
    "overview": "<p>Wobbuffet is a unique Pokemon. Despite having a very limited movepool and downright awful stats bar HP, it is very deadly, as these flaws are compensated for by its access to Shadow Tag. This trapping ability is a blessing for Wobbuffet, as it works fantastically with its movepool and is very deadly in general. In conjunction with Shadow Tag, Encore, Mirror Coat, and Counter all allow Wobbuffet to remove a selected Pokemon, and Wobbuffet is thus often found on offensive teams, as this niche benefits setup sweepers greatly. Sadly, Wobbuffet's Psychic typing is more a curse than a blessing, as it lacks useful resistances and only has small benefits. However, Wobbuffet does make up for it with its very good bulk. Don't be fooled by its measly base 58 defenses, as they are compensated for by Wobbuffet's huge base 190 HP and the fact that it doesn't need to invest EVs into anything but its defenses. The most notable benefit of its Psychic typing is that it makes it a great check to Mewtwo lacking Taunt, which is huge because Mewtwo is often a big threat to offensive teams due to its high Speed, power, and coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers over Custap Berry is a decent option, trading clutch ability for significantly more longevity. Alternative EV spreads are also viable depending on what your team needs to check more. You can focus more on Defense to check foes like Mega Salamence and Primal Groudon better, for example.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Wobbuffet isn't necessarily countered in the traditional sense, due to Shadow Tag, which means a Pokemon cannot switch into it without external aid (e.g. the currently trapped Pokemon is a Ghost-type, has Shadow Tag itself, or is holding a Shed Shell). However, there are a good amount of checks to it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye is Wobbuffet's greatest check. Magic Bounce makes it immune to Encore, while its Dark / Ghost typing makes it immune to Mirror Coat and Counter as well as able to switch out at will. The only thing Wobbuffet can hope to do against it is Destiny Bond, which Mega Sableye can easily play around with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types can hit Wobbuffet very hard thanks to super effective STAB moves. They are also immune to Mirror Coat, so they can simply attack Wobbuffet with special moves without fearing retaliation. Dark-types in Ubers also tend to be special attackers anyway, examples being Yveltal, Darkrai, and Arceus-Dark.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types can escape Shadow Tag, making Wobbuffet ineffective against them. Furthermore, they have a super effective STAB type to hit it with. Their typing also makes them immune to Counter, so they are able to just spam physical moves against Wobbuffet. Good examples are Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt locks Wobbuffet into Counter or Mirror Coat. The Taunt user can then simply spam Taunt, as Wobbuffet can't damage them unless they attack. Furthermore, even if Wobbuffet Encores the foe into Taunt and switches to a teammate, the teammate won't be able to set up, as it will be hit by Taunt upon switching in.</p> <p><strong>Status Users</strong>: Toxic Yveltal, Toxic Lugia, Toxic Klefki, and bulky Will-O-Wisp Arceus formes can just spam their respective moves against Wobbuffet to gradually wear it down. However, note that if Wobbuffet is carrying the rare Safeguard, status can easily be turned against the opponent with Encore.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Utility Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Encore is fundamental, allowing Wobbuffet to lock a Pokemon into a desired move, which either eases prediction with Counter and Mirror Coat, or opens up an opportunity for a setup sweeper to set up safely. Counter and Mirror Coat are the sources of Wobbuffet's damage output, the former being for physical attacks and the latter for special attacks. They work really well in tandem with Wobbuffet's massive HP stat. Destiny Bond lets Wobbuffet remove a Pokemon when it's going to faint the next turn anyway, and it can also be really clutch with Custap Berry. Alternatively, Safeguard is a good option to further ease a teammate's setup, as preventing status for five turns leaves foes like Thunder Wave Klefki and Will-O-Wisp users unable to cripple your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Wobbuffet to survive a +2 Moonblast from Xerneas, so that Wobbuffet can hit back with Mirror Coat for the OHKO or Encore it into Geomancy if it tries to get cheeky. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense for better all-around bulk. Wobbuffet's HP stat is already huge, so there isn't significant need to invest in it. A Calm nature minimizes Foul Play and confusion damage. Finally, Custap Berry is generally the best item option, due to how clutch a last-ditch Encore or Destiny Bond can be.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wobbuffet best fits on hyper offensive teams, as that is where its niche is most useful. It is advised to play conservatively with Wobbuffet. Don't just send it in at every chance it gets to put in work, as Wobbuffet will then be quickly worn down. Instead, identify the prime target Wobbuffet can remove in order to maximize your chances to win. Generally, this comes from realizing the biggest threat to your opponent's team, so Wobbuffet's prime target will be the Pokemon stopping your biggest threat. Removing a Xerneas, for example, will allow your Yveltal to have a field day, and Encoring Primal Groudon into a Ground-type move will allow Mega Salamence to set up freely and likely go on to sweep without fear of being revenge killed by priority moves. Also, stay away from Ghost-types such as Mega Gengar and Aegislash. Not only can they escape Shadow Tag, but the former hits Wobbuffet for massive damage with super effective STAB moves, and the latter can use Toxic which Wobbuffet can't do anything about. Wobbuffet should stay away from Taunt and status users in general. Taunt and status can simply be spammed against Wobbuffet, as it can only do damage if its opponent attacks. Poison or burn will quickly wear down Wobbuffet and it has no ways around it. In these situations Wobbuffet is forced to switch out. An important thing to note is that the moves Counter and Mirror Coat are affected by type immunities; thus, Ghost-types can safely hit Wobbuffet with physical moves and Dark-types can hit it with special moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Generally, deadly setup sweepers are optimal partners for Wobbuffet. The ability to abuse free setup is simply too good. Notable examples are Mega Salamence, Double Dance Primal Groudon, Geomancy Xerneas, Extreme Killer Arceus, Arceus-Ghost, and even Swords Dance Blaziken. A Fairy-type such as Xerneas can also be good, as it takes care of Dark-types such as Yveltal, which threaten Wobbuffet. Yveltal itself can be a good partner, as it takes care of Arceus-Ghost, which also threatens Wobbuffet. Note that offensive Pokemon are usually the teammates you want to go for, as Wobbuffet fits best on offense. Therefore, defensive partners such as Klefki, which can deal with Darkrai, are underwhelming, as they sap momentum.</p> <p>Wobbuffet lacks reliable recovery and is forced to take a lot of strong hits, so a form of offensive support such as Healing Wish can work well with it. This gives Wobbuffet a second round at removing Pokemon or opening up win conditions. One notable Healing Wish user is Shaymin-S, which can also revenge kill Darkrai. Latias is another good Healing Wish user but is a subpar option, as it stacks weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-types.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Scizor is known for being a great Xerneas check thanks to access to Bullet Punch and a strong base 150 Attack. It also has a great movepool, with access to Roost, Pursuit, U-turn, and a variety of other tricks. U-turn and Roost in particular help Mega Scizor to differentiate itself from other Xerneas checks such as Aegislash; U-turn helps Mega Scizor keep momentum for an offensive team and Roost provides reliable recovery. Mega Scizor is also one of the few viable Pursuit trappers, which is one of the best methods for checking threats such as Mega Gengar, Latios, and Latias. Technician is an ability that would be ineffective on most Pokemon; however, for Mega Scizor it works well due to the low Base Power of its moves. Its Steel / Bug typing has always been an effective defensive typing, granting several resistances and an immunity while leaving a single exploitable 4x weakness to Fire-type moves. Mega Scizor's immunity to Poison allows it to switch into a variety of threats without the fear of being hit with Toxic, which is a great asset to both offensive and defensive teams. However, due to Mega Scizor's exploitable weakness, several Pokemon run Fire-type coverage moves almost exclusively for Mega Scizor, meaning that potential danger is always present. Mega Scizor is also bait to powerful threats such as Ho-Oh and Kyogre, and it can be passive because Steel and Bug are poor types offensively. The lack of Leftovers recovery means that Mega Scizor struggles to maintain ample HP when burned in addition to losing all offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off is a possible option over Pursuit. However, in general the utility provided by Pursuit is more useful. A set making use of Swords Dance can help to make Mega Scizor a bit less passive, but with common threats such as Primal Groudon resisting Bullet Punch, it is less viable than in was in previous generations. Mega Scizor does have the potential to run Defog, which can potentially free up a moveslot for another Pokemon, but in general other Defoggers in Ubers such as Arceus, Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O are more effective. A Choice Band set can give Scizor a bit more power and doesn't forfeit the Mega Evolution slot, but the inability to use support moves and the decreased bulk hurts. Lastly, a Life Orb set can still give Scizor a bit more power and the ability to change moves at the cost of taking recoil damage and being slightly weaker than a Choice Band set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Other than with Toxic and Knock Off, Mega Scizor cannot punish Ho-Oh while it can easily OHKO Mega Scizor with Sacred Fire.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon resists Mega Scizor's STAB moves and often runs Fire-type moves such as Lava Plume and Fire Punch, which completely wreck Mega Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: All Fire-types pose an obvious danger to Mega Scizor due to its exploitable weakness. Blaziken can easily OHKO Mega Scizor with Flare Blitz as can Victini with V-Create.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Due to Kyogre's sheer might it can rip through Mega Scizor with neutral Water-type moves. Offensive sets do not like being hit with Toxic or U-turn as they come in, however.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ghost</strong>: Support and Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost can burn Mega Scizor with Will-O-Wisp and deal solid damage with Judgment. However, they dislike being poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Palkia and Dialga</strong>: Palkia and Dialga commonly run Fire Blast and resist Mega Scizor's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Sableye</strong>: Sableye is bulky enough to comfortably tank Mega Scizor's attacks and can punish it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory</strong>: Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory can comfortably take any move Mega Scizor has except for Superpower and can proceed to stack Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Will-O-Wisp and Scald are the two most common sources of burns on Mega Scizor, both of which hamper Mega Scizor from checking its intended threats by halving its Attack stat and dealing passive damage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage Moves</strong>: Many Pokemon have the potential to be running Fire-type coverage moves that can potentially knock out Mega Scizor. Some examples include Hidden Power Fire Xerneas, Hidden Power Fire Latios, Overheat Extreme Killer Arceus, and Flamethrower Blissey.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Red Menace": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Punch serves as Mega Scizor's primary STAB attack. Technician combined with STAB raises Bullet Punch to a more respectable 90 Base Power and checks common Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Diancie. Although Bullet Punch isn't that strong and common types resist Steel-type attacks, the priority of the move has useful utility. Roost is used to give Mega Scizor some staying power, as it is unable to receive passive recovery though Leftovers. Pursuit allows Mega Scizor to forcibly remove threats such as Latios, Latias, Lugia, and Mega Gengar, as Pursuit will hit even if the opponent switches them out. Toxic is a solution to threats such as Lugia and Arceus-Ghost, which cannot be taken down by Mega Scizor's offensive moves alone. U-turn is an option in place of Toxic for more offensively oriented teams that helps keep momentum and prevents Mega Scizor from becoming bait to threats such as Ho-Oh. Lastly, Superpower is a coverage option that nails Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Kangaskhan and can finish some Steel-types such as Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to raise Mega Scizor's overall bulk and help with the ability to use Roost. 60 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature guarantee that Mega Scizor can 2HKO 200HP Xerneas. The remaining 200 EVs are allocated into Special Defense to compensate for Mega Scizor's lower special bulk and to grant it the ability to tank Hidden Power Fire from Mega Gengar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Hidden Power Fire usage on Xerneas has decreased, it is still a possible danger. This set has no qualms about switching into defensive or Choice Scarf Xerneas sets so long as it doesn't have Hidden Power Fire. However, unlike Xerneas checks such as Klefki, you do not necessarily want to switch Mega Scizor into a Geomancy Xerneas on the turn it sets up. The reason being that although Mega Scizor has priority with Bullet Punch, Xerneas will survive if it is at full health and can proceed to knock out Mega Scizor if it has Hidden Power Fire. An alternative approach is to damage Xerneas enough on its setup turn to where Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch can revenge kill the boosted Xerneas; then either sack your least useful Pokemon to get Mega Scizor in for free or directly switch Mega Scizor into a predicted Moonblast if it has enough HP to survive the attack. Xerneas is not the only Pokemon that runs Fire-type coverage moves because of Mega Scizor; even Pokemon such as Blissey have the potential to hit Mega Scizor as it comes in, so scouting for these type of moves is paramount.</p> <p>Because Mega Scizor is immune to Toxic, it can be used as a pivot against defensive threats such as Lugia and serve as an offensive team's solution to opposing Toxic use. Although Bullet Punch is not very strong and has poor offensive typing, Mega Scizor's access to priory should not be overlooked. Keeping Mega Scizor around to threaten Focus Sash users and fast, frail Pokemon such as Deoxys-A can be of great assistance. Mega Scizor should be kept away from burns at all cost, as it will become significantly more difficult to revenge kill Xerneas; the loss of HP each turn also makes keeping Mega Scizor healthy enough to check intended threats very difficult if not impossible. This set is massive bait to Ho-Oh and Kyogre, therefore Mega Scizor's best option if you foresee these threats coming in is either to U-turn out or slap them with Toxic and switch out, assuming you can afford to give these threats a free turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Often a team's greatest weapon against Ho-Oh is Stealth Rock, and because Mega Scizor tends to draw in Ho-Oh, it is best to have a setter of this move that can force Ho-Oh out. Primal Groudon can check both Ho-Oh and Kyogre, which are two of the greatest threats to Mega Scizor, while in return Mega Scizor can check Lugia, Latias, and Latios. Dark-types such as Yveltal, Darkrai, and Arceus-Dark can all be excellent teammates because they annihilate Ghost-types such as Arceus-Ghost and Giratina while they benefit from Mega Scizor's ability to check Fairy-types. Latias and Latios can provide anti-entry hazard support for Mega Scizor while they appreciate Mega Scizor's ability to switch into Fairy-type attacks. Kyogre can crush the Fire-types that give Mega Scizor trouble. Arceus-Rock pairs well with Mega Scizor, as it is one of the best checks to Ho-Oh. Tyranitar can also check Ho-Oh and appreciates Mega Scizor's immunity to Toxic and check to Fairy-types. Palkia can beat several Fire-types and also gives Mega Scizor a switch-in to Kyogre. Lastly, Zekrom can smash Ho-Oh and Kyogre, which are two of the biggest threats to Mega Scizor.</p>"

It also has reliable recovery in Roost, which is something that a lot of Steel-types lack. It has an exceptional typing that grants it ten resistances and two immunities, and it has solid physical bulk. Because of all this, Skarmory is able to check many threats, such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Salamence, Primal Groudon without a Fire-type move, Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Mewtwo X. It can also run a viable specially defensive set that allows it to check Latias, Latios, and support Arceus formes, making it a great Spikes setter. Its ability is not useless either and can allow Skarmory to phaze a threat like Geomancy Xerneas in a pinch. It also benefits from the decline of Electric-types and Palkia. However, it is on the frailer side in terms of special bulk, and it has little offensive presence, making it Taunt bait.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Brave Bird is a viable move that usually 2HKOes Mega Gengar so that Skarmory is not complete Gengar bait; it also hits Mega Mewtwo X and bypasses Taunt. Taunt can be used to shut down opposing entry hazard setters and support Pokemon such as Lugia, in addition to keeping entry hazards up by preventing Defog if Taunt is used as the Defog user switches in. A lead set with Spikes and Custap Berry can set up entry hazards while also providing a check to Mega Salamence and other physical threats for offense, but it struggles to compete with Forretress, which has access to Rapid Spin. Defog can be used on Skarmory, though only if absolutely necessary because it tends to clash with entry hazards. Iron Head can be used to hit Mega Diancie, which will otherwise wall Skarmory. Counter can help Skarmory reliable take out physical attackers but only has situational use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie are excellent checks to Skarmory, because they both bounce back Spikes, Toxic, Whirlwind, Taunt, and Stealth Rock. Additionally, Mega Sableye can burn it and Mega Diancie can whittle at its HP or set up with Calm Mind. Mega Sableye fears next to nothing, while Mega Diancie only fears the rare Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Because of Skarmory's low Special Defense stat, strong special attackers can overwhelm it. Primal Kyogre can simply hit Skarmory with Origin Pulse or Thunder; Yveltal can do the same with Dark Pulse. Neutral Arceus formes can beat the physically defensive set, though they cannot beat the specially defensive set without Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Ho-Oh switches in on Skarmory with ease and threatens it with Sacred Fire, which can even burn and OHKO through Sturdy. It also doesn't fear Toxic too much, as Regenerator will heal off the damage. Primal Groudon can also beat Skarmory if it is running Fire Punch, Lava Plume, or Overheat, though it does not like Toxic and cannot beat Skarmory if it lacks one of these moves.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: If Skarmory lacks Brave Bird or Shed Shell, Mega Gengar can trap Skarmory and use Taunt, which will prevent it from doing anything, and proceed to KO with repeated Shadow Balls or other attacks, making it significantly easier for one of Mega Gengar's teammates, such as Swords Dance Arceus, to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin</strong>: Rapid Spin users can remove the entry hazards that Skarmory sets. Forretress, Cloyster, and Excadrill are the primary users of this move. However, these Pokemon do not necessarily beat Skarmory but rather remove its entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Turboblaze and Teravolt</strong>: By virtue of their abilities, Zekrom, Reshiram, and Kyurem-W can all OHKO Skarmory through Sturdy. They also don't fear much in return from Skarmory.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users can shut down Skarmory, rendering it useless and making it setup fodder for other Pokemon, or simply overpower Skarmory by preventing it from using Roost.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is a mandatory move that offers reliable recovery. Spikes, a move that few Pokemon have access to in Ubers, punishes the Pokemon that Skarmory walls. Toxic allows Skarmory to put a timer on the Pokemon it checks, such as Primal Groudon, and is especially useful in a scenario where phazing is not possible because the opposing Pokemon is the last one left. Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers, namely Mega Salamence, Extreme Killer Arceus, Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, and some Rock Polish Primal Groudon. Stealth Rock can be used if no other teammate can use it, but Skarmory strongly prefers running the more exclusive Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EV investment in HP and Defense allows Skarmory to better take on the physical attackers it needs to stop. Leftovers is the item of choice, as its passive recovery increases Skarmory's longevity. Shed Shell is another viable item, allowing Skarmory to escape from Mega Gengar and other Shadow Tag users. Rocky Helmet is a possible item that gets nice chip damage on foes such as Extreme Killer Arceus, but this is generally not as helpful as Leftovers recovery. Running a physically defensive spread enables Skarmory to primarily check strong physical attackers, such as Swords Dance Arceus, Mega Salamence, and some Primal Groudon, by means of phazing and Toxic stall, as well as to set up Spikes against these Pokemon and punish switches accordingly.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Skarmory into foes it walls, and if the opposing Pokemon is directly threatening via setup, phaze it with Whirlwind. However, if a foe is not setting up or does not pose an immediate threat, Skarmory can take this as an opportunity to spread Toxic and set up Spikes. It should also try to keep healthy with Roost, as if it is too worn down, it can be overwhelmed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is a good teammate for Skarmory, as it checks Xerneas, Kyogre, and Zekrom, all of which threaten Skarmory. Skarmory also appreciates Pokemon that can deal with Ho-Oh, so Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Water, and Mega Diancie make for good teammates; Arceus-Water also helps checks Primal Groudon. Tyranitar checks Ho-Oh to an extent as well while also checking Latias and Latios without stacking Steel-types. Latias and Latios are good partners themselves, as they check Kyogre and Primal Groudon. Giratina-O also checks Primal Groudon and can block Rapid Spin users thanks to its Ghost typing. Finally, Skarmory dislikes being burned, so clerics such as Xerneas, Diancie, Blissey, and Clefable make for good partners.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost is a necessary move to provide Skarmory with reliable recovery. Spikes specifically punishes Latias, Latios, and support Arceus formes, which Skarmory can beat with Toxic. Toxic's primary purpose is pressuring Defog users, especially the aforementioned Arceus, Latias, and Latios. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze setup sweepers in a pinch, such as Mega Salamence, Calm Mind Latias and Latios, and Calm Mind Arceus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature are necessary to best take on Latias, Latios, and Arceus, as Skarmory's base Special Defense stat is low. Leftovers is an important item for passive recovery that allows Skarmory to escape certain 2HKOs, so no other item should be used on specially defensive Skarmory. The main niche of the specially defensive Skarmory set is that it functions as a Spiker that can beat common Defog users Latias, Latios, and support Arceus with Toxic and Roost, enabling it to very reliably set up Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Skarmory into support Arceus, Latias, and Latios, Toxic them, and set Spikes. Keep in mind that Skarmory will have to use Roost often to keep healthy, as the Pokemon it checks wear it down more easily than physical threats wear down the physical set. Do not switch into Calm Mind Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ghost because those will overwhelm Skarmory. Additionally, play carefully around Mega Gengar, because it will trap, Taunt, and remove Skarmory with ease.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar, are very important to deal with Mega Gengar. Arceus-Water is a good teammate that checks Groudon and Ho-Oh. Kyogre checks such as Primal Groudon, Latias, and Latios are useful; the former also checks Xerneas and Zekrom, while the latter two also check Groudon. Giratina-O is a good Groudon check that also spinblocks. Xerneas, Diancie, Blissey, and Clefable offer cleric support, which Skarmory appreciates. Skarmory also likes reliable Stealth Rock setters, such as Primal Groudon, to supplement its Spikes.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle has access to virtually every move, which makes it the only viable Smash Pass Pokemon in Ubers due to its access to both Spore and Shell Smash. It is important to note that Mega Diancie, which looks like a full stop to passing successfully due to its immunity to Spore and ability to OHKO most recipients, falls to a +2 Hidden Power Steel. Smeargle's poor bulk makes it especially susceptible to priority attacks. It also struggles versus common Pokemon such as Darkrai, Mega Sableye, Substitute Perish Song Mega Gengar, and Pokemon with Lum Berry, especially Lum Berry Tyranitar. Finally, using Smeargle requires experience and usually involves a risky game of predictions, and it can only be used once each game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Sticky Web set with Nuzzle, Spore, Rapid Spin, and Sticky Web can be used. However, it is difficult to use Sticky Web teams in this metagame because Latias is very common, quick, and immune to Sticky Web and can remove them with Defog. Entry hazard setting is an option too, but other Pokemon are better at that. Substitute can be used on the Smash Pass set to benefit a frail recipient such as Mega Diancie. Dark Void can be used instead of Spore in order to put Grass-types to sleep, but the drop in accuracy is not worth it, and Grass-types are uncommon in this tier. Geomancy can be used instead of Shell Smash to avoid bulk drops, but then Smeargle has to run Power Herb instead of Focus Sash, which makes it even more difficult to use Baton Pass.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards and sand can break Smeargle's Focus Sash and make it difficult to boost and pass effectively.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: On defensive teams, Pokemon such as Arceus-Water and Lugia can wall and phaze recipients without Magic Bounce if entry hazards are kept off the field.</p> <p><strong>Darkrai</strong>: Darkrai is faster and can put Smeargle to sleep with Dark Void, allowing it to either set up or KO Smeargle.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan can easily OHKO Smeargle because its Parental Bond ability allows it to hit twice, hence breaking Smeargle's Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Lum Berry Arceus</strong>: Lum Berry Arceus can absorb Spore and KO Smeargle with priority.</p> <p><strong>Klefki</strong>: Klefki can paralyze Smeargle with Thunder Wave, giving it a 43.75% of stopping Smeargle from using Baton Pass. Klefki can then proceed to 2HKO Smeargle.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye can bounce back Spore and deal massive damage with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Shaymin-S</strong>: Shaymin-S is faster, is unaffected by Spore, and can flinch and KO Smeargle.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh can absorb Spore with Sleep Talk and can deal a lot of damage to the Shell Smash receiver.</p> <p><strong>Lum Berry Tyranitar</strong>: Lum Berry Tyranitar can take a Spore and knock Smeargle down to its Focus Sash afterwards. Sand damage then KOes Smeargle at the end of the turn.</p>",

      "Smash Pass": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash is used for the boosts, and Baton Pass is used to pass the boosts to the recipient. Spore induces sleep, which makes it easier to boost and use Baton Pass. Hidden Power Steel is used to OHKO Mega Diancie at +2 thanks to the Technician boost, a big threat to Smeargle and intended Shell Smash recipients. The use of Hidden Power Steel over Iron Head or Magnet Bomb avoids situations where Mega Diancie gains a Defense boost from Diamond Storm as Smeargle uses Shell Smash and leaves Smeargle unable to OHKO it after a boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is essential to outspeed many Pokemon in the tier and put them to sleep, such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, and some Xerneas and Dialga sets. Maximum Special Attack EVs are needed to OHKO Mega Diancie after the Shell Smash boosts. Focus Sash ideally gives Smeargle two turns to set up Shell Smash and use Baton Pass. Finally, Technician is used to give Hidden Power Steel the extra power it needs to bypass Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Never lead with Smeargle unless you are 100% sure you can pull a fast win, which in most cases isn't possible. One should use Shell Smash, then use Spore, and finally use Baton Pass. It's important to pay attention when using Spore if there are Magic Bounce users on the opponent's team. Even if it's tempting to Shell Smash in a one-on-one scenario against an unsuspecting Diancie and OHKO it with Hidden Power Steel on the following turn, it is highly recommended not to do this unless you are absolutely sure there are no Pokemon with priority moves on the opposing team.</p> <p>It is important to keep Stealth Rock off the field and play according to your opponent's Stealth Rock user. It's also strongly advised to come in safely after one of your Pokemon has been KOed because Smeargle needs to have all of its HP to do its job. Finally, choose the best recipient according to the opponent's team; you will only be able to pass a boost once. If the opponent has an Arceus, it's preferable to scout to see what their Arceus forme is before setting up. For example, if you pass to Diancie only to find the opponent is using Arceus-Water or Arceus-Ground, that would be a waste.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pair Smeargle with a Pokemon that removes entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock. Primal Groudon is a mandatory recipient because it has monstrous offenses, great typing, and good bulk. Using Diancie is also mandatory. It has great mixed offensive stats and moves and it handles status, can reflect phazing moves with Magic Bounce, and resists Extreme Speed priority. Giratina-O is a highly recommended Pokemon too because it can check the most popular physically offensive Pokemon and can clear entry hazards with Defog. Otherwise, Arceus-Ghost is a great answer to Ditto and can use Defog too. Finally, it's very important to have a Darkrai check on the team because it's a very common threat to Smeargle.</p>"

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<p>Blissey has exceptional HP and solid Special Defense stats which allow it to function as an excellent special wall on stall builds. It has access to useful support moves in Wish and Heal Bell, and its ability Natural Cure heals Blissey's status conditions upon switching out, which allows Blissey to absorb status for a team. It is important to note that Blissey outclasses Chansey in the Ubers metagame, as Blissey can hold Shed Shell to escape Shadow Tag users and has a usable Special Attack stat that deters Mega Salamence with the threat of Ice Beam. Blissey's Normal typing is a mixed bag in that on one hand, it is only weak to Fighting-type attacks, which are not too common, but it only offers a single immunity to Ghost and has no resistances. The shift to a more physically based metagame is unfortunate for Blissey, because it is rather frail physically. Furthermore, Blissey has very little offensive presence, so it can often be bait for Taunt. It is also susceptible to all entry hazards, meaning that it can be worn down relatively easily. In spite of these things, Blissey is an important special wall that offers valuable support to teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blissey has a few other viable moves it can run, though it struggles to fit them into its four moveslots. Flamethrower works similarly to Ice Beam to bypass Mega Gengar, but it hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Klefki instead of Mega Salamence. If a team lacks any other place to fit Stealth Rock, Blissey can set Stealth Rock against the many special attackers it walls. Thunder Wave is a possible alternate status move that cripples fast offensive Pokemon, but it is not nearly as useful against bulky support Pokemon such as Arceus.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: The many powerful physical attackers in Ubers can switch in on Blissey, fearing little besides a Toxic, and proceed to force Blissey out or simply hit it hard through its low Defense stat. Some examples of these include Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, Swords Dance Arceus, Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Mega Mewtwo X. Mega Mewtwo Y and Life Orb Mewtwo can also target Blissey's weaker defensive stat with Psystrike. Note that Mega Salamence must be wary of Ice Beam and recoil from Double-Edge due to Blissey's high HP.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types are immune to Toxic and resist Ice Beam, and they work especially well if they have recovery or a way to punish Blissey, such as with Spikes or a setup move. Ferrothorn can stay healthy and drain Blissey's HP with Leech Seed while setting up Spikes. Klefki can set up Spikes and also force Blissey out with Toxic, though Blissey will heal itself. Genesect can deal a lot of damage to Blissey with U-turn or keep momentum if Blissey switches out. Skarmory can set Spikes and stay healthy with Roost. Excadrill and Scizor can potentially use Swords Dance and proceed to KO Blissey or damage potential switch-ins. Mega Metagross can hit it hard with Meteor Mash, potentially gaining Attack boosts in the process.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Because of Blissey's offensive presence, or lack thereof, Taunt will render Blissey unable to do much against most other Pokemon and can even make it complete setup fodder for another Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: If Blissey is not running Shed Shell, Mega Gengar can trap and remove Blissey. However, it will be forced to Destiny Bond to do so if Blissey is running Ice Beam or Flamethrower unless it is a Perish Song variant of Mega Gengar, in which case it traps and removes Blissey with ease.</p> <p><strong>Rest</strong>: Pokemon that use the move Rest can often force stalemates against Blissey, because neither side can do much damage to the other. For example, Xerneas and Kyogre with Rest cannot do much to Blissey, but they will not take much in return, creating a scenario in which neither side accomplishes anything.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic puts a timer on Arceus formes, Ho-Oh, Groudon, Mega Salamence lacking Refresh, Mewtwo, and other Pokemon Blissey walls. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage so that Blissey is not entirely Taunt bait. Ice Beam is an alternate option that prevents Refresh Mega Salamence from freely setting up, as well as forcing Mega Gengar to use Destiny Bond if Blissey has Leftovers instead of Shed Shell. Snatch allows Blissey to beat Calm Mind Refresh Arceus formes and is more reliable against Geomancy Xerneas; Snatch also blocks Recover from support Arceus formes. Wish and Protect work together to grant reliable recovery, while allowing Blissey to pass massive Wishes to its teammates thanks to a huge HP stat. Protect can also help Toxic stall and scout for lure moves. Soft-Boiled can be used instead of Wish, as it will condense Wish and Protect into one slot for reliable recovery at the cost of making Blissey unable to heal teammates. With the remaining slot, Heal Bell should be used, as it offers cleric support by clearing a team's status conditions.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Defense investment makes the best of Blissey's high special bulk. 252 Defense EVs allow Blissey to survive some weaker physical hits. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Speed, because additional power is not needed and 0 HP EVs gives Blissey an odd HP value so that it takes less damage from entry hazards; additionally, Blissey's already high HP stat makes HP investment less efficient. Shed Shell is the primary item choice and lets Blissey escape from Shadow Tag users. Leftovers can be used with Ice Beam, as it offers nice passive recovery and Blissey does not become complete Mega Gengar bait with Ice Beam. If using Leftovers, 20 HP EVs should be taken out of Defense to hit an HP value that is divisible by 16 to maximize passive recovery. 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD is a viable alternative spread that gives Blissey maximum special bulk, but this comes at the cost of making Blissey extremely physically frail. Natural Cure allows Blissey to function as a status absorber by switching into status and pivoting to a teammate, removing the status condition at no cost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aggressively switch into and sponge hits from special attackers that Blissey can wall, such as Xerneas, Dialga, Kyurem-W, Palkia, and most Arceus formes; however, Primal Kyogre should be avoided because it can overwhelm Blissey with Calm Mind and Origin Pulse. Capitalize on forced switches by spreading Toxic, passing a Wish, or clearing status with Heal Bell. Play carefully around potential physical Fighting-type moves from lures, so scout with Protect as needed. Avoid giving opposing Pokemon free turns by using Protect blindly, however. Try to keep Blissey healthy to avoid being 2HKOed later on in the game, especially because entry hazards tend to wear down Blissey.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Physical walls are vital partners for Blissey, because Blissey gives free switches to physical attackers such as Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Ho-Oh. Blissey is susceptible to all entry hazards and can be worn down easily, so users of Defog and Rapid Spin make for good partners. Support Arceus formes can use Defog, burn physical attackers, and appreciate cleric support; good partners specifically include Arceus-Ghost, which is immune to Fighting and checks physical attackers such as Mewtwo, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Mega Kangaskhan while Blissey checks opposing Arceus-Ghost; Arceus-Water, which soft-checks Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence; and Arceus-Rock, which counters Ho-Oh and checks Yveltal. Checks to Fighting-types, such as Ho-Oh, Latias, Latios, and Giratina formes, are good teammates for Blissey. Finally, Pokemon that lack reliable recovery of their own, such as Klefki, Diancie, and Tyranitar, appreciate the Wish support that Blissey provides.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>The rise of Latios and Latias has given Tyranitar a boost in viability in the Ubers tier, as its ability to Pursuit trap them is invaluable on some teams. Tyranitar also shines in a Flying- and Dark-type dominated metagame, taking on the likes of Arceus-Dark, Darkrai, Ho-Oh, and most offensive Yveltal. Sand Stream is still a very good ability despite Primordial Sea and Desolate Land dominating the tier. It greatly increases Tyranitar's Special Defense, wears down foes with passive damage, and supports Sand Rush Excadrill when harsh sunlight and heavy rain aren't active. On the downside, Tyranitar is complete bait to Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre; both have the type advantage, and their weather-activating abilities override sandstorm. Tyranitar is also quite slow, so it will nearly always take a hit before it does anything. Most importantly, its mediocre defensive typing and lack of reliable recovery make it somewhat easy to wear down, limiting its capabilities as a tank. Nonetheless, Tyranitar shines in a metagame infested with Latios, Latias, Flying-types, and Dark-types, so it is worthy of a spot on many teams, from offense to full stall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Tomb can be used to lower a foe's Speed, which can make making handing faster threats a lot easier. Toxic is the best move that Tyranitar can use against Primal Groudon; the move also puts a timer on dedicated walls and bulky setup sweepers such as Lugia and Calm Mind Arceus formes, respectively. Tyranitar also has a decent special movepool that can allow it to act as a lure; Fire Blast hits Ferrothorn, while Ice Beam lets it take on Mega Salamence. Rest is Tyranitar's only option for immediate recovery, though it's a poor choice if not running Sleep Talk. Earthquake hits Primal Groudon, Mega Diancie, and most Steel-types for good damage. Mega Tyranitar is quite bulky and powerful, but it's a poor choice in Ubers due to Mega Salamence, Gengar, Diancie, and Sableye all providing a much larger amount of utility than it. Dragon Tail gives Tyranitar a phazing move that is not stopped by Taunt, but, more importantly, it does not phaze Geomancy Xerneas. Counter can be used to surprise a physical attacker, particularly Primal Groudon. If running Counter, Shuca Berry will allow Tyranitar to survive an Earthquake from Primal Groudon and KO it. Shuca Berry and Counter also allow Tyranitar to surprise Mega Salamence and Extreme Killer Arceus. Crunch and Payback are Dark-type STAB moves Tyranitar can use to OHKO Deoxys-S with sandstorm damage, ruining their Focus Sash. This causes a nasty momentum shift in favor of the offensive team Deoxys is on, and it still allows them to set up Stealth Rock, so this is not the best strategy ever for dealing with Deoxys-S. On the Dragon Dance set, Aqua Tail can be used over Crunch to 2HKO most Arceus-Ground switch-ins while bypassing Shuca Berry on opposing Tyranitar, but the sacrifice of Crunch or Taunt is not worth using Aqua Tail in most instances.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon is immune to Thunder Wave, can switch into Tyranitar's attacks with impunity, and easily forces it out with the threat of Earthquake or Precipice Blades.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas survives any attack and can deal heavy damage with Moonblast or OHKO Mega Tyranitar with Focus Blast. It can also set up Geomancy if Tyranitar lacks Taunt. However, even unboosted Mega Tyranitar 2HKOes Xerneas with STAB Stone Edge. Bear in mind prior to Mega Evolution and on the turn Tyranitar is Mega Evolving Xerneas is actually faster than Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: All Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave. Groudon and Arceus-Ground come in on Tyranitar and force it out with their STAB Earthquake or Precipice Blades or use it to set up on. Sand Rush Excadrill can turn Tyranitar's sand against it, OHKOing with an unboosted Earthquake; however, it needs to watch out for Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre can easily switch into Tyranitar, overriding the sand brought on by Sand Stream. It takes pitiful damage from all of Tyranitar's moves and force it out with Scald or Origin Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Dialga and Ferrothorn threaten Tyranitar if it lacks Low Kick, while Klefki and Genesect force Tyranitar off the battlefield even if it is carrying Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mega Lucario, Mega Mewtwo X, Arceus-Fighting, and Blaziken all outspeed Tyranitar and easily OHKO it with their Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mewtwo Y</strong>: Mega Mewtwo Y outruns Mega Tyranitar even at +1 and can OHKO it with Focus Blast. Mega Mewtwo Y is only a check to the Dragon Dance set, however, as it will be KOed by Crunch and takes a tremendous amount of damage from STAB Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Deoxys-A</strong>: Deoxys-A is in similar boat to Mega Mewtwo Y; it outruns Mega Tyranitar even at +1 and can OHKO with Low Kick or Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Excadrill</strong>: Excadrill outruns +1 Mega Tyranitar thanks to Sand Rush and can OHKO with a Life Orb-boosted Earthquake; Air Balloon Excadrill can easily shrug off STAB Stone Edge and can withstand a STAB Crunch. Remember that when Tyranitar is boosted and sand is cleared, Excadrill is slower than Mega Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Moves</strong>: Several Pokemon that Tyranitar could otherwise check carry common coverage moves that can put a dent in its health. For example, Mewtwo often runs Focus Blast, Extreme Killer Arceus and Ho-Oh can use Earthquake, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost will usually carry Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Status</strong>: Any form of residual damage is something Tyranitar hates. It has no way of recovering its health outside of Leftovers and is required to take large hits to do its job properly. Many entry hazard users can also set up Spikes on Tyranitar.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Tyranitar to support its team by inflicting passive damage on foes. Not many teams with Tyranitar have room for another Pokemon to use Stealth Rock, so it is generally best to have it on Tyranitar. Pursuit traps and heavily damages Latios and Latias, both of which are extremely prevalent in Ubers. Rock Slide is a fairly reliable STAB attack that hits the many Flying-types of Ubers for a lot of damage, though Stone Edge can be used if you wish to trade reliability for power. Thunder Wave cripples faster threats, particularly Mega Salamence. Roar phazes Pokemon that attempt to use Tyranitar as setup bait and can rack up passive damage with entry hazards on the field. This can be important for keeping boosting Primal Groudon and Geomancy Xerneas at bay if Tyranitar is no longer needed to win. Low Kick nails important Pokemon such as Darkrai, Dialga, Arceus, and Arceus-Dark, but it is usually hard to fit on Tyranitar's set if these threats are already covered.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD maximizes Tyranitar's ability to take special attacks from Yveltal, Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo.

If Tyranitar is using Low Kick, a spread of 248 HP / 72 Atk / 184 SpD with Shuca Berry should be used in order to allow Tyranitar to 2HKO maximum HP Arceus-Dark and still take an Earthquake from Flying-types. Shuca Berry allows Tyranitar to take any one unboosted Ground-type move in the game along with some boosted non-STAB Ground-type coverage moves. Leftovers promotes Tyranitar's longevity, and it is Tyranitar's only method of recovery. Lum Berry can be used to protect Tyranitar from a burn or sleep, particularly from Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire and Darkrai's Dark Void, respectively, though the item is not necessary if your team has a cleric or sleep absorber.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyranitar struggles against Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, so you must judge just how threatening one or the other is in the current situation before deciding to stay in with Tyranitar. Never use Thunder Wave if Excadrill, Arceus-Ground, Groudon, and Primal Groudon are still potential switch-ins to Tyranitar; otherwise, you will lose all momentum while giving a free switch to some of the most threatening Pokemon in the game. You must decide how you want to spend Tyranitar's HP when debating switching into Latias or Latios. Both of them hurt Tyranitar pretty significantly if it switches into Draco Meteor, which could mean a much easier win for your opponent should they have a Ho-Oh partnered with Latios or Latias. Tyranitar will either set up Stealth Rock or use Pursuit, but hardly ever both in one game due to its lack of recovery. Choose wisely which one will be most beneficial. Though Tyranitar can take Flying-type attacks well, it must be careful of coverage moves that Flying-types carry, such as Earthquake on Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Ho-Oh. Tyranitar's typing and ability make it really annoying for physical setup sweepers that aren't immune to sandstorm damage. Use this to your advantage, but make sure not to spend Tyranitar's HP recklessly doing this when it is needed for a Pokemon like Ho-Oh. Make sure to use entry hazard control wisely, as Tyranitar hates the residual damage caused by all forms of entry hazards, particularly Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sand Rush Excadrill appreciates Tyranitar's sand support doubling its Speed, making it a fearsome revenge killer and sweeper. Primal Kyogre and Groudon appreciate the removal of Latios and Latias. Calm Mind Arceus formes appreciate Tyranitar's ability to scare out Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ghost in particular adores how easily Tyranitar comes in on Life Orb Yveltal. A cleric such as Clefable can remove status ailments inflicted on Tyranitar. Latios and Latias take on Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre well while also clearing entry hazards for Tyranitar. Blissey takes on Fairy-types while also providing cleric support, and Alomomola checks Primal Groudon. Both of them pass humongous Wishes to Tyranitar to help with its recovery issue. Arceus-Water is a fantastic partner due to its ability to switch into Primal Groudon and be a secondary check to Mega Salamence. It also clears entry hazards so Tyranitar can switch more freely.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is the main STAB move, with 100 Base Power backed by Tyranitar's base 130 Attack allowing it to do heavy amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. It becomes very potent due to the lack of Pokemon that resist Rock in the Ubers metagame; switch-ins tend to be limited to Steel-types like Klefki. Notably, Stone Edge is able to OHKO Rayquaza, Mega Salamence, and most variants of Yveltal and 2HKO Extreme Killer Arceus and Xerneas. Crunch is Tyranitar's secondary STAB move and is mainly for targeting Steel-types that resist Stone Edge, such as Bronzong, Jirachi, and Dialga. It also targets Ghost-type Pokemon like Giratina-O, Arceus-Ghost, and Mega Gengar and is a more reliable option against neutral targets to avoid missing or wasting valuable Stone Edge PP. Pursuit's main function is to trap foes that are likely to switch out from Tyranitar; notable targets are Giratina-O, Latios, Latias, and in some scenarios Choice Band Ho-Oh not locked into Earthquake. However, one should consider the potential momentum drain when locking Tyranitar into Pursuit, as it can turn into setup fodder. Earthquake provides coverage for targets that resist both of Tyranitar's STAB attacks, such as Klefki and Lucario, and avoids Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, though it is considerably weaker than Crunch. Earthquake also makes dealing with Aegislash easier due to avoiding the Attack drop from King's Shield, and it can score a 2HKO on Primal Groudon. Foul Play is an interesting option to consider on Tyranitar, as it is a common target for Arceus formes trying to set up Swords Dance such as Ground and Extreme Killer Arceus; however, the listed moves are somewhat irreplaceable on Tyranitar, as it would have to forgo Earthquake's coverage or the ability to Pursuit trap targets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment is used so Tyranitar can outspeed as many slower targets as possible, increasing its potency as a wallbreaker. With a Jolly nature, Tyranitar is able to outspeed up to uninvested Yveltal and Xerneas, along with base 90 Speed Pokemon with little or no investment, reaching important benchmarks of outspeeding standard Giratina-O and Rock Polish, offensive, or support variants of Primal Groudon. Maximum Attack investment coupled with a Choice Band maximizes Tyranitar's damage output. Alternatively, an Adamant nature with maximum HP investment can be used to further increase damage output and also allow Tyranitar to survive two Draco Meteors from Latios and avoids a 2HKO from Mega Salamence's Double-Edge after Stealth Rock; however, Tyranitar then misses out on the aforementioned Speed benchmarks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tyranitar can't really switch into much in the current metagame and can't utilize aggressively play very effectively, though in some exceptional cases it may be required, such as double switching Tyranitar in on a Giratina-O switch-in to prevent a Defog and either Pursuit trap to help remove Giratina-O or get in a free Crunch. Usually it is safer for Tyranitar to be brought in after a teammate has fainted, especially when Pursuit trapping key threats such as Latios, as 0 HP Tyranitar is 2HKOed by Draco Meteor and risks being beaten by Grass Knot. Powerful resisted attacks such as Double-Edge from Mega Salamence can 2HKO Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage, but if Tyranitar gets in safely, it is able to comfortably take Mega Salamence on one-on-one, even after an Intimidate drop, as Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge is able to OHKO Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage. You can also try bringing Tyranitar into Ghost- or Dark-type attacks such as Hex and Dark Pulse from the likes of Giratina-O and Darkrai while keeping it considerably healthy to get in as many attacks as possible. Due to this Tyranitar set opting for a Choice Band in favor of a Chople Berry, it isn't able to check common Psychic- or Ghost-types that carry Fighting-type coverage attacks, like Mewtwo and Mega Gengar, and one may have to scout in some scenarios for these coverage moves to ensure Tyranitar is able to deal with these threats.</p> <p>Even with a Jolly nature, Tyranitar is still considerably slow and is only really capable of outspeeding Pokemon that don't invest much into Speed or no Speed at all.  Avoid locking Tyranitar into Pursuit or Earthquake where possible and use them only when necessary, as this could cause a momentum drain and make it setup bait for many sweepers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Geomancy Xerneas. Lugia can only really be dealt with effectively if Tyranitar manages to get a Defense drop with Crunch, meaning Lugia can stall it out with Toxic and Roost most of the time due to Multiscale. Therefore, it is important that Lugia be crippled with some status such as poison or paralysis before sending in Tyranitar to fully combat it.</p>"

      "Indominus Rex": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance bolsters Mega Tyranitar's Attack and Speed, allowing it to overpower its competition while outrunning up to Mewtwo at +1. Stone Edge is its best STAB move against most of the Uber tier to hit threats such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Mega Salamence. After Mega Tyranitar sets up a single Dragon Dance, the majority of Pokemon that take neutral damage from Stone Edge suffer either an OHKO or a 2HKO. Earthquake complements Stone Edge by nailing threats such as Primal Groudon, Dialga, Mega Diancie, Arceus-Rock, and other Tyranitar while offering an accurate option to take out weakened threats that aren't immune to it. Crunch is primarily meant to tear through offensive teams while offering a powerful yet accurate move to fall back on; it notably hits the majority of Psychic- and Ghost-types for super effective damage while being the best neutral attack versus Ferrothorn, Arceus-Ground, and Mega Mewtwo X. Taunt is an optional move to use over Crunch to overcome defensive teams, severely crippling Pokemon such as Lugia, support Arceus, and Skarmory and thus allowing Mega Tyranitar to set up Dragon Dance safely. Low Kick is an optional move primarily for Ferrothorn and Arceus; however, it can also be an effective method to bypass Shuca Berry Dialga and Tyranitar while still 2HKOing Arceus-Ground and the rare Arceus-Fighting at +1. Iron Tail is the last move to consider if only to hit the majority of Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Clefable.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment is necessary to outrun Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Shaymin-S at +1. After Mega Evolution, this leaves Mega Tyranitar at 265 Speed unboosted, which is enough to outrun most base 90s, Xerneas, and Yveltal. When Tyranitar Mega Evolves, remember that it is still at 243 Speed—just slow enough to be outrun by standard Xerneas, which can, after Stealth Rock, OHKO Mega Tyranitar with STAB Moonblast or Focus Blast. Mega Tyranitar's goal is to pick apart defensive cores that can otherwise hinder other offensive sweepers. Most defensive Pokemon such as Lugia, Giratina-O, and Yveltal will lose to Mega Tyranitar. Thanks to sand and Mega Evolution increasing Tyranitar's bulk, Mega Tyranitar can easily set up on threats such as Darkrai, Yveltal, Latios, Latias, and Arceus-Dark. Mega Tyranitar can even be used to check potential threats such as Mega Salamence and Arceus-Ghost; Mega Salamence fails to OHKO Mega Tyranitar with +1 Earthquake, while Mega Tyranitar scares Mega Salamence with STAB Stone Edge, and unboosted Arceus-Ghost will fail to OHKO Mega Tyranitar in the sand with Brick Break or Focus Blast and will be taken down by a +1 Crunch. Aside from hindering Shuca Berry Dialga and Tyranitar, Unnerve is generally useless for an ability—the added benefit of normal Tyranitar having sand to bolster its Special Defense is too good to pass up.</p> <p>Primal Groudon is the number-one Pokemon that can be seen as a stop to Mega Tyranitar. Support Groudon can OHKO Mega Tyranitar at least 37% of the time with Precipice Blades, while +1 Earthquake will 2HKO most Primal Groudon. A more risky approach is to invest 84 EVs into Defense. Provided Stealth Rock is not in play and Primal Groudon does not pack many Attack EVs, Mega Tyranitar can then survive Precipice Blades 100% of the time. This comes at a cost of some power and missing on 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Arceus-Water.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The biggest perk to using Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar in Ubers is its resistance to the majority of priority in the tier. The only priority Mega Tyranitar has to worry about is STAB Bullet Punch from Mega Lucario and Mega Scizor, and Mega Tyranitar can easily stomach one Bullet Punch from either of these Pokemon. When Tyranitar switches in, it is recommended to Mega Evolve right away. The best options are Dragon Dance to put fear into the opponent's switch-in and STAB Stone Edge on potential switch-ins that can threaten Mega Tyranitar's sweep such as full-health Primal Groudon, Sableye that have yet to Mega Evolve, and Primal Kyogre. Taunt can sometimes be a safe option on potential switch-ins, as it can prevent status moves that could cripple Mega Tyranitar or moves that hinder Mega Tyranitar's sweep such as Roost and Whirlwind. After obtaining a Dragon Dance, Mega Tyranitar should use whatever move is necessary to beat its current foe. Remember that running Taunt or Crunch will slightly adjust Mega Tyranitar's playstyle and what Mega Tyranitar can set up on. Under certain circumstances, Mega Tyranitar can lead against Deoxys-S to limit Deoxys-S stacking entry hazards onto the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Like most Pokemon on hyper offensive teams, Stealth Rock support is a must for Mega Tyranitar to guarantee 2HKOs on most Primal Groudon and Arceus-Water while OHKOing Lugia with +1 Stone Edge. Primal Groudon can be used for this role because it can also use Swords Dance to get through potential problems such as Mega Sableye and will shut down Klefki and Primal Kyogre. Offensive Primal Groudon is a great partner, as it enjoys having Giratina-O and Lugia off the field. For other Stealth Rock users, Dialga is a fine alternative in situations that Primal Groudon wants to go for a more offensive route for its ability to pressure Mega Sableye with STAB Flash Cannon while also checking Primal Kyogre. Excadrill will not get as much fun in the sand with this particular Tyranitar; however, it can still be a great partner in instances where Xerneas can get out of control and Mega Tyranitar may need to be sacrificed. Excadrill can also help keep Stealth Rock off the field as well as denting some of the problematic Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Shuca Berry Dialga, and Shuca Berry Tyranitar with STAB Earthquake while holding an Air Balloon. One of the best offensive partners is Xerneas, as Xerneas and Mega Tyranitar will likely overpower most stall teams while having a guaranteed win against Darkrai. Aromatherapy just adds to Xerneas's great relationship with Mega Tyranitar, as it can clear nasty status effects that Mega Tyranitar might have taken in the heat of battle while switching into attacks such as Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire. Ho-Oh can be a great teammate, as it scorches Ferrothorn and Arceus-Fairy while checking Xerneas. Primal Kyogre is an interesting partner for Mega Tyranitar, as it can beat Primal Groudon and Mega Sableye in exchange for Mega Tyranitar eliminating Latios and Latias. Finally, Giratina-O makes for a good teammate because it can hamper Swords Dance Arceus-Ground and other potential threats such as Mega Blaziken.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is the most consistent option as a Stealth Rock setter, with support and Jolly Swords Dance sets being the most potent choices. Primal Groudon also provides a check to Xerneas and a switch-in to Kyogre and Klefki that are likely to come in on Tyranitar. In return, it appreciates Tyranitar dealing with common threats such as Yveltal, Latios, Rayquaza, and Giratina-O. One should take the shared Ground weakness into account, though, making solid Ground-immune Pokemon a great choice to consider on the team. Giratina-O is able to check offensive variants of Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground while also helping out with Extreme Killer Arceus formes, providing the ability to cripple these targets with status moves like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. Mega Salamence can be considered on more offensively oriented builds,  as it is a solid setup sweeper with good offensive synergy, is a decent answer to Primal Groudon due to having Intimidate pre-Mega Evolution, and can be a answer to Swords Dance Arceus variants. In return, Tyranitar deals with common Mega Salamence answers such as defensive Yveltal and Lugia. Calm Mind Arceus-Ground can be a interesting set to consider to help out against Primal Groudon and potentially sweep unprepared teams, due to Tyranitar's ability to remove the deterrence Ho-Oh causes to Calm Mind Arceus-Ground; because this option opens up a weakness to Primal Kyogre, one may opt for another Primal Kyogre switch-in along with Primal Groudon such as Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn is also able to relieve Groudon of its Stealth Rock duties and provide another Xerneas answer. Other Steel-types such as Klefki and Bronzong also provide good defensive synergy, being able to deal with common threats to Tyranitar such as Xerneas, Deoxys-A, and Mewtwo. Arceus-Water can also fulfill the role of a defensive check to Primal Groudon, crippling it with Toxic, and of a Primal Kyogre pivot. It further can provide Defog support, help against Mega Diancie matchups, and most importantly deal with Ho-Oh, as Sacred Fire burns are a deterrent to Tyranitar. Mega Gengar has good offensive synergy with Tyranitar and can trap and remove common switch-ins to Tyranitar like support Arceus formes. A Hypnosis + Hex set is the most potent option for Mega Gengar, though Destiny Bond sets can force a trade against key threats such as offensive Arceus variants and Ho-Oh and remove Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy with Sludge Wave. Xerneas variants such as Choice Scarf and Geomancy are good offensive choices for teams; Xerneas appreciates Tyranitar's ability to soften down Primal Groudon, as it is a common switch-in to Tyranitar, enabling Geomancy Xerneas to be a solid wincon. Choice Scarf Xerneas is able to effectively absorb sleep from Darkrai and is also an effective revenge killer. Primal Kyogre with Calm Mind is an effective wallbreaker against stall teams, helps to wear down Primal Groudon alongside Tyranitar, and helps against special variants of Arceus-Ground. Tyranitar can Pursuit trap common Kyogre answers such as Latios and Latias to remove them from the game in return. Excadrill benefits from Tyranitar's Sand Stream ability and can be an effective sweeper or cleaner, especially against offensive teams, due to Sand Rush letting it outspeed notable boosted threats such as Geomancy Xerneas.</p>"

  "Lugia": {
    "overview": "<p>Amazing defensive stats, access to reliable recovery, and a fantastic ability in Multiscale make Lugia a defensive monster in Ubers. Lugia has an unusually high base Speed of 110 for a defensive Pokemon, which allows it to outspeed many opposing Pokemon and Roost before they can attack with only a little investment, if any. A wide support movepool and enough room in its four moveslots let it be specifically tailored to better deal with a threat. Unfortunately, Lugia necessitates additional entry hazard control and cleric support to keep Multiscale intact and to continue to be able to check powerful physical threats. Additionally, a lack of offensive presence makes Lugia susceptible to Taunt and unable to keep momentum for more offensive teams. As such, Lugia is relatively one-dimensional in spite of its movepool, as it fulfills only one role and can only fit on stall and a few balanced teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lugia can opt for Thunder Wave as an alternate status move, as it cripples fast threats such as Mewtwo and Xerneas, but Lugia will have difficulty dealing damage without Toxic. Substitute can be used to block status moves and stall out Toxic while also forcing the foe to try to break the Substitute. Aeroblast is a stronger move than Ice Beam in general, but it does not hit anything in particular and has low PP. Psyshock is another usable STAB move that hits Mega Gengar super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic cripples Lugia and renders it unable to wall the physical threats that it is supposed to counter. Because Toxic damage occurs at the end of each turn, Lugia must repeatedly Roost to keep Multiscale intact and loses most of the staying power it needs to stall out a foe.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock breaks Lugia's Multiscale, leaving Lugia susceptible to being 2HKOed by a strong attack if it tries to switch in with Stealth Rock up. Lugia can also be overwhelmed much more easily, as it is forced to Roost more often when it takes 25% damage upon switching in.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types completely wall Lugia because they are immune to Toxic and resist all of Lugia's common attacks. Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can all set up Spikes against Lugia; Klefki is also able to hit Lugia with Toxic. Dialga can also set up Stealth Rock and use Toxic on Lugia.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie can both bounce back Whirlwind and Toxic thanks to Magic Bounce. In return, Mega Sableye can Taunt Lugia and burn it with Will-O-Wisp while easily shrugging off any damage dealt by Lugia with Recover. Mega Diancie can set up Calm Mind and overwhelm Lugia, or hit it with a super effective Diamond Storm, though Lugia will not be beaten by repeated Diamond Storms; Mega Diancie is also immune to Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can come in on Lugia and use Taunt, preventing Lugia from using Roost or Whirlwind. It can then KO Lugia by repeatedly using Shadow Ball, while Lugia is unable to switch because of Shadow Tag. Mega Gengar can also remove Lugia with Perish Song. However, Dragon Tail will force out Mega Gengar in spite of Taunt, and Psyshock easily 2HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Lugia's reliance on Toxic to deal damage makes it bait for Taunt. Ice Beam is not very strong against most neutral foes, so when Lugia is hit by Taunt, it is usually forced out, as otherwise an opposing setup sweeper could use the Taunt as an opportunity to set up for free. Dragon Tail will bypass Taunt in this situation, however.</p> <p><strong>Arceus Formes with a Type Advantage</strong>: Arceus formes that have a type advantage can beat Lugia, although not very efficiently. These include Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Electric, Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Ice, and Arceus-Rock. Calm Mind variants fare especially well against Lugia because they can set up and beat Lugia with repeated boosted Judgments, though they absolutely hate Toxic and can be phazed by Whirlwind. Arceus-Dark is particularly dangerous because it has Refresh to clear Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Teravolt and Turboblaze</strong>: Teravolt and Turboblaze bypass Multiscale, so Zekrom and Kyurem-W can ignore Lugia's ability and OHKO or 2HKO it with Bolt Strike or Ice Beam, respectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost provides reliable recovery for Lugia, allowing it to consistently stay healthy and keep Multiscale intact. Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers, preventing them from overwhelming Lugia with repeated boosted hits. Toxic is Lugia's main way of dealing damage and allows it to wear down threats such as Primal Groudon. Ice Beam circumvents Taunt and hits Mega Salamence for doubly super effective damage, which is especially important against Refresh Mega Salamence if it is the last Pokemon on the opposing team. Reflect helps Lugia wall foes reliably, even when Multiscale is not intact; it also provides support for Lugia's teammates, though this is not the primary purpose of Reflect. Dragon Tail can be used over Whirlwind, as it bypasses Taunt at the cost of not being able to hit Fairy-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs give Lugia maximum mixed bulk while also giving Lugia an HP value that is divisible by 16, which increases Leftovers recovery. 120 Defense EVs with a Bold nature help Lugia consistently take hits from the physical attackers in Ubers. 136 Speed EVs allow Lugia to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza. An alternate Speed benchmark is using 96 Speed EVs to outspeed neutral-natured, fully invested base 90 Speed Pokemon. This spread allows Lugia to invest slightly more in its Defense than the 136 Speed spread. Multiscale halves the damage that Lugia takes while at full HP, which lets Lugia take boosted hits from strong attackers relatively well. Leftovers provides nice passive recovery in addition to Roost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is very important to keep Multiscale intact by using Roost, avoiding burns and Toxic, and clearing Stealth Rock; however, it should be noted that keeping entry hazards on the opponent's side will greatly increase the effectiveness of Lugia's phazing. Generally, switch Lugia into almost any physical attacker and proceed to spread Toxic, use Roost if Lugia is in danger of being overwhelmed, and phaze setup sweepers with Whirlwind. Make sure to use Toxic first before phazing a setup sweeper that cannot 2HKO Lugia, with the exception of a potential Geomancy Xerneas, which should be phazed immediately with Whirlwind. Toxic is generally the more effective way for Lugia to deal damage, but Ice Beam should be used on predicted Taunts and against some Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence and Rayquaza. When the opponent has a strong switch-in for Lugia, especially one that can take advantage of a switching opportunity such as Mega Gengar or Klefki, double switching can keep momentum and prevent these Pokemon from taking advantage of the opportunity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard control is extremely important to keep Multiscale intact, so Defog Arceus formes, Latias, Latios, and Rapid Spin Excadrill make for good partners. Pokemon with Magic Bounce can also help keep away Stealth Rock, so Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie pair well with Lugia; they also serve as status absorbers by bouncing back status moves. Other status absorbers that can switch into status moves, such as RestTalk Primal Kyogre and Refresh Arceus, are good teammates. Additionally, Steel- and Poison-types can switch into Toxic, while Fire-types can absorb burns. Instead of absorbing status, cleric support from the likes of Clefable, Blissey, Mega Diancie, and Xerneas can remove status conditions that weaken Lugia. Lugia also appreciates Spikes support from Ferrothorn and Klefki, as Spikes synergizes well with Lugia's walling capabilities and Whirlwind by punishing switches; however, because of Lugia's inability to keep momentum through offensive pressure, suicide entry hazard setters such as the Deoxys formes are not good partners. Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Aegislash can trap Mega Gengar, which threatens to Taunt and remove Lugia. Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon can take advantage of the Steel-types that frequently switch into Lugia.</p>"

  "Ho-Oh": {
    "overview": "<p>Ho-Oh's relatively high Attack stat, strong STAB Brave Bird, and powerful STAB Sacred Fire, which also has a high chance to burn, make it one of the most difficult Pokemon to switch into. Its typing, annoyingly high Special Defense, access to Recover, and fantastic ability in Regenerator give it the staying power to continually apply pressure to the opposing team, as well as the ability to check many threats, including Geomancy Xerneas. Ho-Oh also received a godsend in two new, reliable Magic Bounce users in Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, which can keep Stealth Rock off the field for it. Latios and Latias also regained their Soul Dew, making them some of the best users of Defog in the game in order to help Ho-Oh with its crippling weakness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive Ho-Oh with an Impish nature, an EV spread of 248 HP / 208 Def / 52 SpD, and a moveset of Recover, Sacred Fire, Brave Bird, and Whirlwind can be used, but it doesn't really do much in a metagame where Stalltwo doesn't perform well at all and Extreme Killer Arceus carry Stone Edge commonly. It has to compete with Lugia and specially defensive Primal Groudon cores as well. Toxic can be used to ruin Lugia's and Arceus-Rock's staying power for other Ho-Oh and its teammates. Tailwind can be used on the Life Orb set to double Ho-Oh's team's Speed for three turns after use. Flame Charge will give a longer-lasting Speed boost, but it costs a Life Orb hit and cannot be utilized by Ho-Oh's teammates.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock might be very difficult to set up, but it takes away any defensive utility Ho-Oh provides. Ho-Oh cannot effectively abuse switching or Regenerator and is therefore crippled heavily while Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Arceus-Rock is the best Ho-Oh switch-in the game has. Sacred Fire burns and Earthquake can wear it down pretty easily and Thunder Wave is problematic for it, so Arceus-Rock needs to be careful around Ho-Oh despite being the closest thing to a counter Ho-Oh has. Tyranitar hates Sacred Fire burns and Earthquake but can set up Stealth Rock on Ho-Oh in most cases, forcing it out into a Defog, Magic Bounce, or Rapid Spin user. Tyranitar can OHKO Ho-Oh with Rock Slide if it is not burned or can attempt to paraflinch Ho-Oh with Thunder Wave and Rock Slide if Ho-Oh lacks Earthquake or is locked into another move. Mega Diancie outspeeds and OHKOes Ho-Oh with Diamond Storm. It can also 2HKO Ho-Oh with Diamond Storm while burned, but it must watch out for Earthquake if it cannot KO Ho-Oh in one turn.</p> <p><strong>Stone Edge Users</strong>: Primal Groudon can take any one hit from Ho-Oh and easily OHKO with Stone Edge. Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Arceus-Fairy all outspeed and OHKO Ho-Oh with Stone Edge, but it is less common on Arceus-Fairy and is only common on Extreme Killer; Arceus-Ground will always have Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Primal Kyogre will either outspeed or take any one hit from Ho-Oh, and it can then KO Ho-Oh with its Water-type STAB. Arceus-Water with Judgment beats Ho-Oh a very good amount of the time if Thunder Wave doesn't score too many turns of full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Refresh Mega Salamence</strong>: Bulky Mega Salamence with Refresh can set up on Ho-Oh locked into Sacred Fire pretty easily due to Refresh nullifying Sacred Fire's high burn rate. It forces Life Orb Ho-Oh out with the combination of Roost stalling for Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil and attacking when Ho-Oh attempts to Recover.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom hates Sacred Fire burns and Earthquake, but it resists both of Ho-Oh's STAB attacks and can OHKO it with Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia hates Sacred Fire burns, but it can Roost stall most Ho-Oh out of Sacred Fire PP if it is locked into the move, or with Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil until it is safe to use Toxic on Ho-Oh's Recover. Lugia will likely be paired with a cleric of some kind, so a burn won't be hindering it for very long.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic causing extra damage alongside Brave Bird and Life Orb recoil cuts into Ho-Oh's staying time significantly, despite it having Regenerator. Life Orb Ho-Oh in particular is a recoil machine and should be kept away from Toxic at all costs if you want it to do anything significant.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird is Ho-Oh's primary move for huge damage while pressuring Steel-types and Rock-types alike for its partners. Sacred Fire not only has a ridiculous burn rate but also does enough damage to be used liberally with a Choice Band. Sacred Fire's burn chance also heavily cripples most of Ho-Oh's would-be checks 47.5% of the time, making it extremely hard to switch into. Earthquake 2HKOes Tyranitar, forces Arceus-Rock to Recover, and 2HKOes maximum HP Primal Groudon. Sleep Talk gives Ho-Oh the ability to punish Darkrai, something other Ho-Oh sets lack. Sleep Talk's randomness also makes a sleeping Ho-Oh even harder to switch into.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Near-maximum HP investment along with 52 Special Defense EVs are used to always survive a +2 Thunder from Geomancy Xerneas. 12 Speed EVs are used in order to outrun Diancie before it Mega Evolves. The remaining EVs are used in Attack in order to put as much power behind Brave Bird, Earthquake, and Sacred Fire as possible. If Ho-Oh's team already has a very good backbone that checks Geomancy Xerneas, running maximum Attack and Speed investment with an Adamant or Jolly nature works also in order to allow Ho-Oh not to be scared out by Kyogre and other base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Primal Groudon. This is especially usable because offensive Primal Kyogre variants are OHKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird after any chip damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When using Choice Band Ho-Oh instead of Life Orb Ho-Oh, keep in mind that it trades the ability to switch moves, paralyze Xerneas, and use Recover for the ability to absorb Dark Void from Darkrai, hit harder, and take less recoil per hit. This means it does more for its offensive partners but has slightly less defensive utility, which is made up for by its ability to take Dark Void. When deciding whether to use Sacred Fire or Brave Bird, there are several factors to take into consideration, as both are very low-risk moves that do a bunch of damage and possibly burn their targets. Primal Kyogre should be the first Pokemon you look for, because heavy rain makes it immune to Sacred Fire; therefore using Brave Bird or switching is a better play if it is on your opponent's team unless you wish to force it in. Mega Salamence is the second Pokemon you should look for, as Refresh variants can set up on a Ho-Oh locked into Sacred Fire; Brave Bird forces Refresh Salamence to Roost stall Ho-Oh, therefore keeping it at bay. If Tyranitar or Arceus-Rock is present, scoring a Sacred Fire burn can be very beneficial for both Ho-Oh and its Flying-type teammates, as Ho-Oh can now do a monstrous load of damage to burned Arceus-Rock in particular with Earthquake. Clever use of Regenerator and Ho-Oh's entry hazard control teammates can result in Ho-Oh doing damage throughout the entire game. Use Ho-Oh's team to keep Stealth Rock off its side of the field at all costs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A stronger Xerneas backbone consisting of Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Klefki, Excadrill with Tyranitar, Aegislash, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Lugia should be considered when using Choice Band Ho-Oh, as while Ho-Oh will deal a very large amount of damage to Geomancy Xerneas, it will never OHKO it from full HP. Two forms of Stealth Rock prevention are required when using Choice Band Ho-Oh. Latias, Latios, and Arceus-Water all use Defog for Ho-Oh and pair well with Magic Bounce users as an added bonus. The viable Magic Bounce users to choose from are Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, while Rapid Spin can come from Excadrill with Tyranitar. Mega Gengar can trap and KO Stealth Rock users and can also KO Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock with Focus Blast or Destiny Bond depending on the situation; Tyranitar is almost always the Stealth Rock user on its team anyhow. Primal Groudon, Latios, and Latias all switch into Primal Kyogre should Ho-Oh need to lock itself into Sacred Fire or Earthquake while Primal Kyogre is still in play. Klefki and Ferrothorn also help handle the Rock-types Ho-Oh cannot get past. Other Flying-types and physical attackers that pair well with Ho-Oh are required, as otherwise you are better off using Life Orb Ho-Oh. Rayquaza, offensive Yveltal, and Extreme Killer Arceus are all very good examples of these.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is Ho-Oh's primary move for doing damage. It has 180 Base Power after STAB and few foes resist it, making Ho-Oh very good at breaking down teams with it by applying pressure to important Steel- and Rock-types. Sacred Fire is a decently reliable and powerful STAB attack that allows Ho-Oh to bypass Steel-types that resist Brave Bird and has a very nasty 47.5% chance to burn its target when factoring in Sacred Fire's 95% accuracy; it also helps discourage Tyranitar and Zekrom switch-ins, as a burn heavily cripples them. Recover gives Ho-Oh recovery outside of Regenerator in order to bolster its already annoying longevity and nullify Stealth Rock damage if necessary. Recover is preferred over Roost in order to avoid being hit by Ground-type moves should the opponent predict the usage of Roost. Thunder Wave allows Ho-Oh to cripple Choice Scarf and Geomancy Xerneas and paralyze Arceus-Rock or Mega Salamence for a teammate. Earthquake 2HKOes Tyranitar and forces Arceus-Rock to Recover. It will hardly ever be a safer move than Sacred Fire or Brave Bird, though.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Even with Ho-Oh's gargantuan special bulk, it still needs near-maximum HP investment along with 52 Special Defense EVs in order to always survive a +2 Thunder from Geomancy Xerneas. Earthquake Ho-Oh runs 12 Speed EVs minimum in order to outspeed and Earthquake Diancie before it Mega Evolves. The remaining EVs are used in Attack in order to put as much power behind Brave Bird and Sacred Fire as possible. If Ho-Oh's team already has a very good backbone that checks Geomancy Xerneas, running maximum Attack investment is also an option.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This is Ho-Oh's bread-and-butter set for doing damage, paralyzing Arceus-Rock and Xerneas, and overall being a large pain for the opponent when Stealth Rock is out of play. Use Ho-Oh's team to aggressively keep Stealth Rock off the field if Ho-Oh is important to its team's game plan. Most Steel- and Fairy-types allow Ho-Oh to switch in and use very low-cost attacks because of their importance to their team and inability to directly threaten Ho-Oh; use this to your advantage in every way possible. If you need one of Ho-Oh's checks badly poisoned, recklessly using Sacred Fire or Thunder Wave may be a bad idea; use Brave Bird instead. Even when Ho-Oh is low on health, clever uses of Regenerator will keep it in the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ho-Oh always wants two forms of Stealth Rock prevention on its team. This can come from Defog users such as Latias, Latios, Arceus-Water, or Arceus-Rock; Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie; the Tyranitar and Excadrill duo because of Excadrill's ability to Rapid Spin; or Mega Gengar, which traps and removes the Stealth Rock user while also using Taunt if Stealth Rock has not yet been set up. Arceus-Water and Focus Blast Mega Gengar help check or remove the Rock-types that plague Ho-Oh. Arceus-Water, Latios, and Latias help a Ho-Oh that doesn't carry Earthquake deal with Stone Edge Primal Groudon. Latias, Latios, Power Whip Ferrothorn, and Primal Groudon help keep Primal Kyogre in check, although defensive variants annoy them all. Other Flying-types such as Mega Salamence and Rayquaza benefit from Ho-Oh's powerful Brave Bird and ability to spread burns to their checks with Sacred Fire. Paralyzing a Arceus-Rock is a massive boon for both also.</p>"

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>Blaziken can potentially be a dangerous sweeper with the combination of Speed Boost and Swords Dance. This is due to its great output with a combination of strong STAB moves, Life Orb, and a solid base 120 Attack stat. Additionally, Blaziken pairs very well with other physical attackers, such as Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence, since they can break down each other's checks and prepare for a sweep. It can even use Baton Pass to switch out and pass its boosts to its teammates. Unfortunately, Blaziken is hindered by four-moveslot syndrome and is heavily crippled by paralysis. Blaziken is also checked by many common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Arceus-Water, hindering its effectiveness against many teams. Furthermore, without setting up, Blaziken's damage output leaves something to be desired, and due to its bad defensive stats, it cannot sponge hits, thus making it very difficult to set up. Blaziken cannot fit on many builds and really has to be built around in the beginning of the teambuilding process.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Blazikenite is an option for those who want Blaziken to be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Deoxys-A at only +1 Speed. However, holding the Mega Stone makes Blaziken weaker than if it holds Life Orb and gives up its team's slot for a Mega Pokemon. Substitute is an option to set up Swords Dance more easily and to be safe from priority attackers, but only further adds to the high residual damage received from Flare Blitz and Life Orb. Toxic is a cool option to break down bulky Pokemon, being able to punish Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Primal Groudon that commonly switch into Blaziken. Focus Sash can be used as an alternative item to be used on a more Baton Pass-oriented set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Giratina</strong>: Both formes of Giratina are not threatened by either of Blaziken's STAB moves and are bulky enough to take multiple hits. They can also use Dragon Tail and force Blaziken out making it lose all of its boosts.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia is an incredibly bulky Pokemon that can eat up all of Blaziken's moves consistently. Lugia is slightly annoyed by Knock Off, but it checks Blaziken well regardless.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes</strong>: Arceus formes like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon do not take super effective damage from Blaziken's STAB moves and can check it fairly easily. They are never 2HKOed and can constantly switch in with no troubles, always forcing Blaziken to switch.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon is bulky enough to take any one hit from Blaziken while heavily threatening Blaziken with an OHKO from Precipice Blades. Primal Groudon also stops Blaziken from switching in with the fear of Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie</strong>: Mega Diancie deters Blaziken's High Jump Kick with Protect and is not hit very hard by Low Kick or any of Blaziken's other moves.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ghost</strong>: Arceus-Ghost is immune to Blaziken's Fighting-type STAB, forcing Blaziken to use Flare Blitz and incur recoil damage. Knock Off alone does not 2HKO; committing to Flare Blitz is required.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Bulky Rest sets from Xerneas threaten Blaziken heavily due to the fact that they can shrug off Blaziken's attacks and heal off the damage it deals while it incurs recoil damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Users</strong>: Mega Salamence is able to Intimidate Blaziken before it Mega Evolves and is only threatened by the possible Hidden Power Ice. Without Hidden Power Ice, Mega Salamence can set up Dragon Dances on Blaziken and potentially sweep your entire team. Landorus-T is also only threatened by Hidden Power Ice, and it can threaten Blaziken with an OHKO from Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: Both Latios and Latias resist Blaziken's STAB moves, but they can be covered with Knock Off if Blaziken is carrying it.</p> <p><strong>Priority users</strong>: Priority users such as Deoxys-A or Arceus can pick Blaziken off after Flare Blitz and Life Orb recoil.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock and Spikes wear down Blaziken very quickly, especially with the recoil damage that Blaziken receives.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is one of Blaziken's main STAB moves, 2HKOing almost every Pokemon that doesn't resist it; while the recoil along with Life Orb recoil does wear down Blaziken very quickly, it is still a necessity. Protect gives Blaziken the ability to gain a Speed boost without taking damage or status, letting it outspeed prominent threats such as Mega Salamence on the next turn. Swords Dance can be used to hit harder, but it is hard to set up and utilize. High Jump Kick is insanely strong against everything that doesn't resist it but is risky when the opponent has a Ghost-type or a Protect user. Notably, it is able to 2HKO most variants of Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage, which is significant because wearing down and threatening out Primal Groudon is very important in most matches. Low Kick is an alternative STAB option without the risks of recoil from missing or attacking into protect, but it does little damage to lighter Pokemon like Diancie and less damage in general than High Jump Kick, even against heavy Pokemon like Primal Groudon. However, it is a much safer option and doesn't really miss out on any important 2HKOs that High Jump Kick would get. Hidden Power Ice can be used as a coverage move to clobber Mega Salamence and Landorus-T, while Stone Edge would be mostly used in conjunction with Swords Dance to hit Flying-types like Ho-Oh very hard. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to pick off Ghost-types and Psychic-types like Giratina-O and Latios, which normally annoy Blaziken immensely. Baton Pass is also an option in the last moveslot to give Blaziken's boosts to a teammate for a sweep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naughty nature is preferred when using Hidden Power Ice so that it gets the most possible damage, while an Adamant nature is preferable when only using physical moves so that Blaziken's defenses aren't weakened. A Naive or Jolly nature can also be used if you want Blaziken to outspeed Mega Gengar and Mewtwo at +1 speed. Full Speed and Attack investment is used to maximize Blaziken's effectiveness as an attacker. Life Orb is chosen over Blazikenite to boost damage output while allowing you to run another Mega Evolution on your team.</p> <h4>Usage Details</h4> <p>Use Protect to get a free Speed Boost when in against threatening Pokemon, but do not use it against setup sweepers, as free boosts for the opponent is never a good thing. Use Swords Dance on predicted double switches to gain momentum and break down walls. Blaziken is meant to function as a late-game cleaner or a wallbreaker to open up for another physical sweeper. It's very important to get Blaziken into play safely, as it is very frail and already has to deal with so much recoil damage. Therefore, bring it in via a double switch or against a Pokemon that cannot truly threaten Blaziken. Flare Blitz should be used carefully because of the intense recoil it has especially combined with Life Orb. Your opponent may try to bait you into using Flare Blitz to wear Blaziken down, so be wary. Blaziken does force a lot of switches due to its great damage output, so Blaziken can really threaten defensive cores if used correctly. Take advantage of the switches that Blaziken forces through anticipating these switches and picking an option appropriately, such as selecting the correct attack or bringing in another strong wallbreaker to really break down opposing defensive cores. Try not to get statused by Klefki or other Pokemon because Blaziken is heavily crippled once it is paralyzed or afflicted by Toxic. Be careful of priority users such as Deoxys-A and Extreme Killer Arceus because they can pick Blaziken off after it incurs recoil damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Salamence is a good offensive teammate to wallbreak and is also a solid secondary late-game cleaner. Klefki provides Spikes support to wear down checks and can cripple opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave or Toxic to help Blaziken clean more easily. Extreme Killer Arceus is an amazing physical sweeper and has great synergy with Blaziken, as they break each other's checks so that one of the two can sweep, much like with Blaziken and Mega Salamence. Xerneas is one of the best setup sweepers in the game and can easily clean up opposing teams once Blaziken has weakened Primal Groudon and other Xerneas checks. Mega Diancie checks Lugia and the Dragon-types that give Blaziken trouble, creating great synergy between the two. Dialga is a great Stealth Rock user that can provide Thunder Wave support and is a great offensive presence that can wear down bulky Pokemon. Primal Groudon provides Stealth Rock and a good offensive teammate to wallbreak, not to mention possible Thunder Wave support.</p>"

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>Sableye's increased bulk and incredible ability, Magic Bounce, after Mega Evolving let it switch into almost every entry-hazard setter in the Uber tier. With its ability to keep Stealth Rock and Spikes off the field, along with its amazing typing that makes it immune to Normal-, Fighting-, and Psychic-type attacks and only weak to Fairy-type attacks, Mega Sableye carves itself a large niche. This, along with its great supporting movepool, allows Mega Sableye to be a reliable stop to dangerous physical attackers such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Deoxys-A, Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Kangaskhan. Mega Sableye can also cripple or completely halt many support Pokemon found on more defensive teams, such as defensive Yveltal, Klefki lacking Dazzling Gleam, Tyranitar, Lugia, and Ferrothorn. On the other hand, two popular Stealth Rock users, Primal Groudon and Dialga, can overpower Mega Sableye with their powerful STAB attacks, so it cannot always reliably keep Stealth Rock off the field by itself. Mega Sableye is also complete setup fodder for powerful special sweepers and wallbreakers such as Geomancy Xerneas, Darkrai, and Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, and it loses to some of the tier's most powerful physical wallbreakers: offensive Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza. Overall, with proper team support Mega Sableye is incredibly hard to pin down and beat and offers a few very rare and sought-after roles on defensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is a possible option on Mega Sableye to allow it to anti-lead even Skill Swap variants of Deoxys-S, and it can ease prediction against switch-ins such as Xerneas and Darkrai, but it is almost always just as beneficial to hit them with a status move. Counter deals more damage than Metal Burst, but it is illegal with Prankster meaning that Sableye loses a little bit of its utility before it Mega Evolves. Knock Off can cripple or weaken Xerneas, Darkrai, or Ho-Oh on the switch, but many items in the Uber tier cannot be removed, making it an inferior option in many cases. Sucker Punch can do decent damage to Latias and Latios and can whittle down checks without reliable recovery such as Primal Kyogre in a pinch, but it has little use outside of those scenarios.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Xerneas can switch into Mega Sableye with little cost and either OHKO it right away with Moonblast or set up Geomancy and threaten the rest of Mega Sableye's team. Arceus-Fairy can easily switch in and threaten Mega Sableye with Judgment or Defog entry hazards away. Mega Diancie threatens Mega Sableye with Moonblast and can deflect status moves with its own Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While it is unable to put Mega Sableye to sleep, Darkrai can freely set up Nasty Plot and OHKO it. Offensive variants of Yveltal can also 2HKO Mega Sableye with Dark Pulse or Oblivion Wing. However, Mega Sableye completely counters Tyranitar and defensive variants of Yveltal.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Primal Groudon is immune to Will-O-Wisp, can overwhelm Mega Sableye with Precipice Blades, and can possibly 2HKO or burn Mega Sableye with Lava Plume. Mega Sableye can switch into defensive variants running Earthquake and Stone Edge, however. Offensive variants of Ho-Oh can 2HKO Mega Sableye with either Brave Bird or Sacred Fire, but they do not appreciate switching into Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Arceus Formes</strong>: Mega Sableye cannot 2HKO any of them with Foul Play, and they eventually break through and threaten the rest of Mega Sableye's teammates. Variants running Refresh cannot be worn down with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic either.</p> <p><strong>Wish Passers and Clerics</strong>: Blissey and Clefable shrug off anything Mega Sableye can do except for Taunt and can pass gigantic Wishes to their teammates or rid them of status.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Mega Sableye cannot 2HKO offensive variants and they can OHKO in return with Origin Pulse. Defensive variants can use Rest to rid themselves of status and can 2HKO Mega Sableye with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence with Refresh</strong>: Mega Salamence can easily break through Mega Sableye, and Mega Sableye has no chance of landing a 2HKO unless Mega Salamence uses an Adamant nature.</p> <p><strong>Rayquaza</strong>: Rayquaza can 2HKO Mega Sableye, but it does not appreciate being burned or hit by Foul Play after the Defense drop from Dragon Ascent.</p> <p><strong>Dialga</strong>: Dialga can beat Mega Sableye one-on-one with its powerful STAB attacks and can easily force it out in order to set up Stealth Rock.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Foul Play has STAB and bypasses Mega Sableye's low Attack stat by using the opponent's Attack stat against them. It also punishes physical sweepers who set up, as doing so increases Foul Play's power. Will-O-Wisp halves the opposing Pokemon's Attack and slowly wears it down. This allows Mega Sableye to avoid the 2HKO from many boosted threats and either stall them out with Recover or KO them with Foul Play. Recover gives Mega Sableye reliable recovery so that it can switch into both entry-hazard setters and the physical attackers it is supposed to check more reliably throughout the match. The fourth moveslot has many viable options. Fake Out allows Sableye to Mega Evolve without taking damage and break a potential Focus Sash against suicide leads such as Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, and Greninja. Many balanced and stall teams rely on Sableye Mega Evolving on the first turn safely, making this the best move in many cases. Protect can be used instead of Fake Out to Mega Evolve safely and works well in conjunction with the residual damage from Will-O-Wisp, but it does not break Focus Sashes and can potentially give the opponent a free turn to set up. Toxic is another viable option, as it can put switch-ins such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Fairies on a timer. Finally, Metal Burst can pick off powerful wallbreakers such as offensive Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza after some prior damage due to Mega Sableye's ability to tank a single hit from all of them. However, Mega Sableye's low HP stat makes it unable to OHKO them from full HP and leaves it at low HP after using Metal Burst.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sablenite is required to give Sableye enough bulk to check the physical attackers that it is supposed to check and give it Magic Bounce so that it can keep entry hazards off the field. An EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with an Impish nature maximizes Mega Sableye's physical bulk, as it is almost always used to check physical attackers, while minimizing residual damage from hazards should it fail to keep them off the field. If using a move other than Fake Out in the fourth slot, a Bold nature should be used to minimize Foul Play damage from opposing Yveltal because Sableye's own Foul Play does not take its Attack stat into consideration. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 124 Def / 136 SpD with an Impish or Bold nature allows Mega Sableye to avoid the 2HKO from Timid Mega Mewtwo Y's Fire Blast and almost always avoid the 2HKO from Naive Life Orb Deoxys-A's Ice Beam, but it takes away from Mega Sableye's much-needed physical bulk and makes it more difficult for Sableye to perform its main roles of keeping hazards off the field and checking strong physical attackers at the same time. This spread avoids the 2HKO from these moves only if Stealth Rock and Spikes are off the field, so secondary hazard control such as Defog is necessary when using this EV spread.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Sableye is almost always used on more defensive teams, as it clashes with many offensive Pokemon due to it halting momentum and having no offensive presence unless the opposing Pokemon has a high Attack stat. Mega Sableye effortlessly blocks entry hazards from almost every hazard setter in the tier except for Primal Groudon, Dialga, Mega Diancie, and Deoxys-S with Skill Swap, so switching in liberally to block hazards is usually safe. If running Fake Out or Protect, Mega Sableye should almost always lead because Mega Evolving safely early on in the game is required for many of the teams on which it is found. Sableye can remain in its normal form if having Will-O-Wisp as a priority move is deemed important, but keep in mind that the extra bulk and Magic Bounce are almost always more useful than the utility that Prankster offers. When using Mega Sableye, keeping it healthy is extremely important so that it can switch into both hazard setters and strong physical attackers. For this reason it is recommended to use Recover on predicted switches. One should also be careful of using Will-O-Wisp too recklessly, as it gives a free switch to Fire-types such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. In addition, one should consider whether possible switch-ins are better off burned as opposed to paralyzed or poisoned if Mega Sableye's teammates run other status moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ho-Oh is probably the best teammate for Mega Sableye, as it appreciates Stealth Rock off the field, appreciates physical attackers being checked, and can check special attackers such as Xerneas and Darkrai in return thanks to its massive Special Defense stat. Lugia is also a great partner, as it can check the powerful wallbreakers that beat Mega Sableye, such as Mega Salamence, Primal Groudon, and Rayquaza, and Mega Sableye's ability to keep Stealth Rock off the field helps keep Lugia's Multiscale intact. Reliable Defoggers such as Arceus-Water and Latias provide almost airtight hazard control in conjunction with Mega Sableye's ability. Arceus-Water notably checks Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Ho-Oh, while Latias is one of the few safe switch-ins to Primal Kyogre in the Uber tier. Primal Groudon works well with Mega Sableye, as it can check Fairies and Primal Kyogre as well as set up Stealth Rock reliably. Ferrothorn is also a good teammate, as it checks Primal Kyogre and certain Xerneas variants. The residual damage from Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp also wear down opposing Pokemon quickly.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>While Mega Mawile has the highest Attack stat in the game, its middling Speed and poor dual STAB coverage mean that it struggles with wallbreaking, contrary to what its Attack stat would suggest. In particular, it is completely stopped by Primal Groudon, which resists both of Mawile's STAB moves and can outspeed it. Mega Mawile's niche is largely in checking some specific special attackers with its fantastic defensive typing while being able to gain momentum with Baton Pass, allowing it to switch out of the Pokemon that it cannot harm.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mawile has a few other options that it can use in certain situations, with moves such as Foul Play discouraging opposing physical sweepers from setting up on it, Focus Punch bypassing Ferrothorn and hitting Primal Groudon relatively hard on the switch, and Rock Slide KOing Ho-Oh on the switch regardless of Stealth Rock being on the field or not. It also gets access to Stealth Rock, which can be used if you need a Stealth Rock setter that can switch in on Latios and Latias while not being setup bait for Xerneas. All of these moves perform much poorer against Primal Groudon than those on the Baton Pass set, though.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon can switch in and take minimal damage from any attack Mawile uses and OHKO it with any STAB attack. Rock Polish variants can also set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn can switch in and take very little from any of Mawile's STAB attacks and wear it down with Iron Barbs and Leech Seed damage. Leftovers and Leech Seed recover about as much damage as Mawile does to Ferrothorn, and allows Ferrothorn to easily stack Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre can switch in on a predicted Iron Head, avoid being KOed by Sucker Punch, and OHKO Mawile with Origin Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes</strong>: Support Arceus formes can burn Mawile with Will-O-Wisp, neutralizing Mawile's offensive abilities, and recover the damage that Mawile does to them.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: Arceus-Ground OHKOes Mawile with Earthquake and can set up if it comes in after Mawile has knocked out an opposing Pokemon and threaten to sweep. Mawile has a hard time stopping it due to Arceus-Ground not being pulled into Sucker Punch range after a Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh cannot switch in when Stealth Rock is set up, as it will then be KOed by Sucker Punch after taking damage from any attack, but if Stealth Rock is not set up it can switch in and threaten Mawile out with a Sacred Fire while recovering most of the damage it took from switching into an attack from Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Mawile's ability to check Xerneas and other special attackers is impeded significantly when Spikes are on the field, and with Mawile not having any recovery, all chip damage is permanent.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Like all physical attackers, Mawile hates getting burned. While clerics would normally be capable of dealing with this, all chip damage on Mawile is permanent, and taking a single round of burn damage means that it will fail to check the things it normally would manage to check, on top of Mawile losing all of its offensive presence while it is burned.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head is Mawile's STAB attack that, with hardly any Attack investment whatsoever, gives it the ability to OHKO Fairy-types, including standard Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock and Diancie. Play Rough OHKOes Yveltal, Darkrai, Latios, and Latias and deals a lot of damage to all of the common Dragon-types in Ubers. Additionally, it provides a nearly guaranteed OHKO on standard Arceus-Dark after Stealth Rock. Sucker Punch is Mawile's way of circumventing its terrible Speed stat and OHKOes offensive Mewtwo, as well as the rarer Mega Mewtwo Y. Sucker Punch is the only priority move that Mawile gets, and it can also aid Mawile in cleaning up weakened teams, considering that almost every Pokemon will outspeed it. Baton Pass is what gives Mawile a niche over Klefki; it can generate good momentum on forced switches or, if you mispredicted your opponent, be a slow momentum grabber, allowing something to come in for free without risk of taking damage or mispredicting.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP and Special Defense EVs enable Mawile to always survive any attack from +2 Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage and any attack from neutral Salamence, allowing it to revenge kill Salamence with Play Rough. The EVs also allow Mawile to switch comfortably into all Yveltal variants, barring the rare Heat Wave Yveltal, thanks to its typing. 16 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature guarantee an OHKO on standard Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage or OHKO after Iron Head and Sucker Punch if Stealth Rock is not set up. Intimidate is the only useful ability Mawile gets before Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mawile can check most special attackers, barring some Arceus formes and Kyogre, due to its natural bulk; however, its lack of recovery means that it should be played quite conservatively if it is needed later on in the game to stop a Geomancy Xerneas sweep, as it doesn't take much prior damage for Mawile to fail to check Xerneas. Once physical walls are weakened and Mawile isn't needed to check something to avoid a sweep, it can be used to put a dent in many Pokemon that do not resist its STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Kyogre is a fantastic teammate for Mawile thanks to its ability to weaken Groudon and the synergy it has with Mawile, with the only two Pokemon that wall both of them being Primal Groudon and Ferrothorn. Latias can deal with most of the special attackers that Mawile struggles with, such as Kyogre and some Calm Mind Arceus formes. Having a solid Ho-Oh switch-in is important, as without Stealth Rock set up Ho-Oh can switch in on Mawile with ease; as such, Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Water, Giratina-O, and physically defensive Primal Groudon can be good partners. It is also good to have a Pokemon that resists or is immune to Ground on the team, making Giratina-O and Latias good partners, especially because they can provide Defog support, which Mawile needs because Spikes ruin its ability to take on Geomancy Xerneas.</p>"

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Salamence's high-Base Power moves coupled with Aerilate and its solid base 145 Attack stat are very potent despite the high defensive stats that quite a few common Pokemon in Ubers possess. Its defensive capabilities from Intimidate before Mega Evolving and its very good Defense stat after make it a premier Ground-immune Pokemon on most hyper offense teams, and it can use this bulk to boost its Attack and solid base 120 Speed stats to further levels with Dragon Dance. It even gets reliable recovery in Roost to help it perform well as both a Ground-immune Pokemon and setup sweeper. Unfortunately, a nasty Stealth Rock weakness will usually shave off much of its utility it would otherwise have at full health, and due to the nature of hyper offense teams, it will often find itself without Defog support. Many Pokemon in Ubers also have the option of carrying Ice-type moves specifically aimed at Mega Salamence, which can drastically cut into its above-average survivability if they don't OHKO it outright.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set consisting of Roost, Dragon Tail, Body Slam, and Defog can be run if a team needs a Defog user that keeps Extreme Killer Arceus in check and doesn't get bowled over by Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost. A spread of maximum HP and Defense with an Impish nature should work just fine with this moveset. If your team desperately needs a sleep absorber, a set of Rest, Sleep Talk, Thrash, and Dragon Dance can be used as well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: It might power up Facade with Toxic, but Lugia still has the bulk to survive it even after a Dragon Dance boost and will phaze Mega Salamence or pressure it with Ice Beam and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Rock</strong>: Arceus-Rock KOes Mega Salamence with Judgment after any prior damage and a +1 Earthquake will never OHKO Arceus-Rock from full health without a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus</strong>: Support Arceus-Water, Arceus-Dragon, and Arceus-Ground have enough bulk to take Mega Salamence's hits reasonably. Support Arceus-Water needs Ice Beam to threaten Mega Salamence, so it should always be scouted for. Mega Salamence can set up all over it and start smashing its foes with 140 Base Power Facade after Arceus's Toxic otherwise. Arceus-Dragon will have the upper hand on Mega Salamence thanks to its STAB Dragon-type Judgment. Support Arceus-Ground will usually take Mega Salamence's boosted hits worse than its other variants due to it running less bulk, but it will be running Ice Beam far more often than not.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Fairy</strong>: Arceus-Fairy survives a hit from +1 Mega Salamence and can KO it with Judgment after any kind of prior damage, including Double-Edge recoil.</p> <p><strong>Dialga and Zekrom</strong>: Shuca Berry saves Dialga and Zekrom from Earthquake, while Draco Meteor is a surefire OHKO coming from Dialga. Zekrom also has a good shot of OHKOing Mega Salamence with either Draco Meteor or Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Klefki</strong>: Thunder Wave and Play Rough give Klefki a shot at beating Mega Salamence pretty handily; otherwise, it makes Mega Salamence very easy to revenge kill after Klefki has been pulverized.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory will usually carry Whirlwind and plenty of bulk to survive any boosted attack Mega Salamence want to throw at it and phaze Mega Salamence afterwards. Mega Salamence will still beat Skarmory if it is the last Pokemon though, unless Skarmory is carrying the rare Counter.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie</strong>: Mega Diancie doesn't like switching into Double-Edge at all and a +1 Earthquake OHKOes it. Mega Diancie does, however, avoid the Double-Edge 2HKO narrowly and can OHKO Mega Salamence with Moonblast after recoil.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Shuca Berry saves Tyranitar from Earthquake and it will proceed to cripple Mega Salamence with Thunder Wave and attempt to make it flinch with Rock Slide until it is in the KO range Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon doesn't like taking hits from Mega Salamence at all, but can tank a hit from it regardless and can phaze it with Dragon Tail or Roar, attempt to beat it with Thunder Wave in tandem with Rock Slide or Stone Edge, or pick off a weakened Mega Salamence with the rare Dragon Pulse or Dragon Claw. Lava Plume burns are also very debilitating for Mega Salamence carrying Earthquake instead of Facade or Refresh.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge gives Mega Salamence a healthy shot at 2HKOing 252 HP / 244 Def Bold Arceus-Water after it has taken 12% from a burn, Stealth Rock, or any other source of prior damage. Extreme Killer Arceus is also OHKOed by Double-Edge from +1 Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock damage. Return and Frustration are recoil-less options that are better suited for sweeping rather than trading with big threats and walls like Double-Edge is. Choose its primary STAB move carefully; Mega Salamence loses a very noticeable amount of its power when using Return, and it's a big enough deal that Mega Salamence will want to run Double-Edge more often than Return. Roost amplifies Mega Salamence's ability to set up and keep its sweep sustained should it need to. Facade enables Mega Salamence to take advantage of status used against it and allows it to take Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire without fear of a burn ruining its attacking power. Facade does very meaningful damage to most Steel-types when Mega Salamence has been afflicted with the status move they carry and also leaves large dents in support Arceus forms, especially when boosted by Dragon Dance. Earthquake gives Mega Salamence the ability to OHKO Klefki, pick off a weakened Arceus-Rock, and bust through Dialga, Tyranitar, and Zekrom if their Shuca Berry is consumed. If Mega Salamence is going to be heavily catered towards sweeping, Refresh can be used to relieve itself of status conditions. Dragon Dance gives Mega Salamence a way of punishing passive play or a forced switch, giving it more power to break open teams and a solid chance to sweep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An EV spread of 248 HP / 124 Atk / 136 Spe with an Adamant nature gives Mega Salamence the bulk to always survive an uninvested Ice Beam from Arceus-Water as well as Judgment from Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Fairy, makes Double-Edge recoil less dangerous, and allows Salamence to switch into physical attackers in a more forgiving manner. Alternatively, a spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe will always allow Salamence to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon before and after Mega Evolving, although the lack of bulk allows offensive Stone Edge users, such as Primal Groudon, to OHKO Salamence after Stealth Rock. The 176 Speed EVs are most important when Salamence is switching into Jolly Ho-Oh, although Timid Primal Kyogre, Jolly Primal Groudon, and other positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon do exist. Generally the 176 Spe spread will be used when running Return and Earthquake/Refresh, as 80 HP Mega Salamence is more catered towards sweeping than its 248 HP counterpart.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Knowing what Mega Salamence can and can't set up on is pretty key to its play, especially if it is a wincon. If Facade is carried, a Ho-Oh locked into Sacred Fire is a pretty safe setup opportunity for Mega Salamence, provided Ho-Oh's team is weakened enough to make Mega Salamence's Speed boost from Dragon Dance worthwhile. Landorus-T locked into Earthquake or Superpower and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground are two other examples of Pokemon that Mega Salamence can set up on relatively safely. Primal Groudon is a riskier setup target because of its bulk, raw Attack stat, and Stone Edge combined with Swords Dance. Generally, Mega Salamence wants to use Double-Edge or status-boosted Facade on Primal Groudon in order to set up a revenge kill or finish off a weakened Primal Groudon, especially if you have little to no information on what set it is running. Know that Facade ignores the Attack drop when Mega Salamence is burned, making Mega Salamence a very safe switch into Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire so long as the residual damage won't matter much. On the downside, Ho-Oh's Brave Bird will 2HKO Mega Salamence, and Jolly Ho-Oh will outspeed most Salamence the turn it is Mega Evolving. If Brave Bird is likely the opponent's play of choice, bringing Salamence in directly isn't the best idea. Alternatively, Salamence's Intimidate can cut Ho-Oh's Attack in order to soften the blow for one of its partners. Facade is a monstrous STAB move when boosted by status and allows Mega Salamence to force nasty trades with Klefki, among other bulkier and more passive Pokemon, to open up holes for other team members to utilize. If it matters at all, make sure you know what status ailment you would rather have Mega Salamence afflicted with, as all three Facade-boosting statuses have nasty side effects.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Salamence tends to beat down the Steel-types on balance teams, which helps make way for a partnered Xerneas to win the game later. Mega Salamence is also one of the best Pokemon to switch into Primal Groudon's attacks and Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire, which is something Xerneas greatly appreciates. Klefki can switch into support Arceus-Dragon and Ice Beam + Defog Arceus-Water very soundly and threaten them both out with Toxic, with the added bonuses of bringing Spikes so that Mega Salamence might get KOs on support Arceus variants more easily. Being able to switch into Xerneas for Mega Salamence doesn't hurt either. Support Arceus-Water with Defog is a Pokemon to consider when using another Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock alongside Mega Salamence. Mega Salamence can also partner with Giratina-O with Defog on bulky offense teams in order to focus more on finding optimal setup opportunities while Giratina-O picks up most of the defensive slack.</p>"

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>With the release of Soul Dew in ORAS, an item that boosts Latias's Special Attack and Special Defense by 50%, she returns to the forefront of the Ubers tier with both new and old tricks. One of the newer ones is her access to Defog, which provides a team with an excellent non-Arceus Defogger and allows her to function as an effective defensive pivot. Levitate is as useful as ever due to the common use of Ground-type attacks, and further helps to mitigate entry hazard damage. Latias is also quite useful both defensively and offensively, thanks to a great base 110 Speed, strong offenses and defenses, and an ability to check both Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. She is not without flaws, however; although Pursuit has limited distribution it is still a very dangerous threat. Latias is also hard pressed for free moveslots and needs defensive investment to do her job well, meaning her damage can be lacking at times. Certain Fairy-types can also pose a significant threat, along with common Dark-types such as Darkrai and Yveltal. Latias is also in competition with Latios to an extent, although her comparatively higher bulk gives her a niche even for offensive sets. Another niche she has over her twin is the move Healing Wish, which is an incredibly useful move for offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Calm Mind can turn Latias into a good wallbreaker or late-game cleaner, but her damage is lacking without multiple boosts. Investing in Special Attack can help with this, but then the set is directly outclassed by Latios. Healing Wish can prove to be huge for offensive teams, but Latias has trouble fitting it onto her moveset. Offensive teams can arguably benefit more from Latios, so the opportunity cost can be too high. Hidden Power Fire can deal huge damage to Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Excadrill as well as 3HKO Klefki, but a free moveslot is hard to come by. Reflect Type is effective against sand teams because it makes Tyranitar and Excadrill rather useless against Latias. However, it is hard to drop a standard move for it. Latias has access to Reflect and Light Screen, the first being quite useful to boost her Defense. Tailwind is another interesting option for offensive support, but it is generally outclassed by Healing Wish. Refresh is great considering how much Latias despises status, but she just doesn't have room for it due to both her STAB types having types immune to them. Toxic can be great to nail Lugia and other bulky Latias checks as they come in, while Thunder Wave can really punish more offensive Latias checks. Magic Coat can be used to deflect status like Toxic, along with other moves like Taunt, but again there really isn't room and it's a prediction-reliant move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Tyranitar, Aegislash, and Mega Scizor are the most common Pursuit users. Pursuit will severely damage or even knock out Latias if she switches on the turn the move is used, and if she doesn't switch, there is the risk of taking attacks from these threatening Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Arceus-Dark is the most threatening Dark-type to Latias, as it can hard wall any set and set up in Latias's face. Yveltal is also quite threatening due to Sucker Punch and its powerful Dark Pulse. Darkrai is faster than Latias and can threaten her with Dark Void or Dark Pulse, although it won't be switching into a Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia can take any of Latias's attacks, Whirlwind Calm Mind sets, and threaten with Toxic. Other than running a move like Toxic, there is little Latias can do to Lugia.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Klefki is a great check to Latias, resisting both of her STAB types and being able to threaten her with status moves and Play Rough. Ferrothorn doesn't like Hidden Power Fire but can Toxic or Leech Seed Latias and hit hard with Gyro Ball. Skarmory and Bronzong also resist both of Latias's STAB types and can Toxic stall her out. Specially defensive Dialga can also threaten Latias with Toxic and doesn't take significant damage from Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Defensive Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy can avoid the 2HKO from Psyshock, but they can be beaten by the Calm Mind Latias set. Mega Diancie can threaten Latias as well, but it won't like switching into Grass Knot or Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ghost</strong>: Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost can revenge kill any Latias set, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost can set up on Latias. If Latias has Calm Mind herself, she can win against it.</p> <p><strong>Dark- and Ghost-type Priority</strong>: Although Latias is quite bulky, she still doesn't like having to take Sucker Punches from Mega Kangaskhan or Shadow Sneaks from Giratina-O when she is damaged.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set revolves around Latias's ability to provide excellent Defog support while serving as a blanket check to several threats. Using Latias as a Defogger also has the advantage of not forfeiting your Arceus to a support set, allowing you to be more flexible when building with Pokemon such as Ho-Oh. For balance and defensive teams, Roost is mandatory as you will need Latias to have staying power. Draco Meteor is the strongest STAB move Latias can use, and it hits opposing Dragon-types as well as offensive Primal Groudon sets for huge damage. Grass Knot lets Latias hit Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie, but it makes her weaker against Pokemon such as Calm Mind Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh. Psyshock is Latias's best option for a Psychic-type STAB move if the added effectiveness against Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh is necessary.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used to ensure that Latias is faster than Pokemon with base 100 Speed, such as Palkia and Mega Kangaskhan. 120 Special Attack EVs allow Latias to 2HKO offensive Primal Kyogre with Psyshock and 2HKOes Primal Groudon that lack significant Special Defense investment. All other investment for this set goes into HP, allowing Latias to escape the 2HKO from Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam. An alternate spread of 160 HP / 52 Def / 120 SpA / 176 Spe still checks Kyogre but gives up some special bulk to better tank Dragon Claw from Adamant Primal Groudon. 96 Speed EVs and a Timid nature will beat Pokemon with base 90 Speed, while 136 Speed EVs and a Timid nature will beat max Speed Rayquaza. Lastly, max Speed is an option to Speed tie with opposing Latias, Latios, Gengar before Mega Evolution, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set despises Pursuit, so the best way to help combat this is to double switch into appropriate teammates when you see potential Pursuit users in Team Preview. In addition to Pursuit, this set also dislikes status in general, so use tactics such as sending a status absorber into a Klefki that attempts to Toxic or Thunder Wave Latias. Fairy-types also like to come into Latias, so effective use of Grass Knot or Psyshock can punish those obvious switch-ins, especially if they are from offensive teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>When using Defog Latias on an offensive team, you will want an entry hazard setter that is not a suicide lead such as Groudon or Dialga. This is because offensive teams with suicide leads are focused on keeping entry hazards up for the duration of the match, which is counterproductive when running Defog. For balance and defensive teams, your Arceus is now free to run a stallbreaker set rather than a Defog support set. Ho-Oh in general is an excellent teammate for this Latias set because it threatens a variety of the Pokemon that like to switch into Latias, while Ho-Oh benefits from the anti-hazard support and Latias's ability to check Pokemon such as Kyogre and Primal Groudon. Primal Groudon is also a great partner, as it can usually comfortably switch into the Fairy-types and Steel-types that come into Latias, and can absorb Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Mega Scizor is a good partner for a similar reason and can also come into Toxic, has reliable recovery and thus reduced switching cost, and can threaten opposing Lugia with Toxic; Mega Scizor can also Pursuit trap Shadow Ball Gengar. An offensive or defensive Fairy-type is also a good choice, as Arceus-Dark completely walls this Latias, while Darkrai and Yveltal pose a great threat. Mega Salamence and Yveltal, like Ho-Oh, also greatly appreciate the Defog support Latias provides. An emergency cleric such as Xerneas or Mega Diancie on an offensive team can also be of great utility for Latias, as Toxic is very detrimental to this set, while more defensive clerics such as Blissey or Clefable suffice for balance and stall teams.</p>"

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>With the help of Soul Dew, which boosts its Special Attack and Special Defense, Latios is a fearsome special wallbreaker that is able to fire off extremely powerful Draco Meteors. Additionally, its typing and ability give it key resistances to Fire and Water as well as an immunity to Ground, allowing it to serve as a decent check to dominant metagame threats such as Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. Latios also has a good base 110 Speed and a movepool including numerous coverage options and Defog, allowing it to wallbreak effectively and provide hazard control for its team. However, Latios's typing leaves it weak to many common attacking types, such as Fairy, Dragon, Ghost, Dark, and Ice. Latios is also vulnerable to Pursuit users, which can eliminate it with relative ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Latios is fairly limited in regards to other options. Tailwind can be used to temporarily boost the Speed of Latios and its teammates, and it can be used after Latios is no longer needed, working in a similar manner to Memento. Magic Coat allows Latios to serve as an anti-lead to common entry hazard setters, such as Deoxys-S. Thunder Wave allows Latios to cripple fast setup sweepers that might attempt to set up on it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, such as Klefki, Bronzong, Jirachi, Ferrothorn, Aegislash, Mega Scizor, and Arceus-Steel, check Latios well because they resist both of its STAB moves. However, many of them can be worn down and must be wary of Hidden Power Fire, especially Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users</strong>: Tyranitar, Aegislash, and Mega Scizor carry Pursuit and can eliminate Latios with it. However, Tyranitar must be wary of switching into Grass Knot, and Mega Scizor must be wary of Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Dark</strong>: Arceus-Dark can switch into Latios and threaten it with a super effective Judgment. Although it takes significant damage from Draco Meteor, it has reliable recovery in the form of Recover, and it can set up alongside Latios with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ghost</strong>: Arceus-Ghost is similar to Arceus-Dark in that it can switch in and use Recover while threatening Latios with a super effective Judgment. Swords Dance variants have a much more difficult time switching in, but they also threaten Latios with Shadow Force or Shadow Claw.</p> <p><strong>Fairies</strong>: Bulky Xerneas variants and Arceus-Fairy can switch in and threaten Latios with Moonblast and Judgment, respectively. Mega Diancie can take a Psyshock and threatens Latios with Moonblast in a one-on-one scenario. All of them are immune to Latios's strongest attack, Draco Meteor, which allows them to switch in more easily.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mega Gengar can trap and eliminate a weakened Latios. Darkrai outspeeds Latios, can put it to sleep with Dark Void, and threatens it with Dark Pulse. Mewtwo outspeeds Latios and can hit it with a super effective Ice Beam or Shadow Ball; Mega Mewtwo X can hit Latios with Ice Punch. Yveltal, Mega Kangaskhan, and Giratina-O all have super effective priority in either Sucker Punch or Shadow Sneak. Genesect outspeeds Latios thanks to Choice Scarf and can hit Latios with U-turn while also retaining momentum. Deoxys-A can outspeed Latios and hit it with Knock Off or Pursuit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog allows Latios to remove entry hazards for its teammates. Draco Meteor is Latios's most powerful STAB attack and is the most potent move for wallbreaking. Psyshock is another STAB option that hits Fairies and specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Ho-Oh; it also does not drop Latios's Special Attack stat after being used. Roost greatly improves Latios's longevity, allowing it to use Defog and check threats such as Primal Kyogre more consistently. Hidden Power Fire can be used instead to hit Steel-types that resist both Draco Meteor and Psyshock super effectively, trading longevity for coverage. Memento allows Latios to prevent setup sweepers from boosting after Latios uses Draco Meteor and can also be used to create setup opportunities for Latios's teammates after Latios is no longer needed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Latios to make use of its good Speed tier and outspeed a good portion of the metagame. A Modest nature with 252 Special Attack EVs is preferred to maximize Latios's damage output and pressure threats such as Primal Groudon; however, a Timid nature can be used if it is necessary to Speed tie with other Pokemon that have base 110 Speed. Some lower Speed benchmarks can be used with a Timid nature; for example, running 176 Speed EVs allows Latios to outspeed fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon. When using Hidden Power Fire with a Timid nature, 180 Speed EVs should be invested to compensate for the lower Speed IV.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Latios should be played aggressively to make use of its offensive capabilities, it is important to manage how much HP Latios has so that it can still use Defog and check opposing threats throughout a match. Be careful when using Draco Meteor, as after the resulting Special Attack drop, Latios will likely be forced out; this can create setup opportunities for opposing sweepers. Additionally, when using Defog against Primal Groudon, be wary of Thunder Wave and Dragon-type moves, which Primal Groudon carries somewhat frequently. Memento can be used to prevent an opposing sweeper from setting up freely or to create a setup opportunity for Latios's teammates; however, do not sacrifice Latios too early and risk opening up a weakness to Primal Groudon or Primal Kyogre.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is a good partner for Latios because it can switch in and threaten the Fairy- and Steel-types that commonly check Latios. Ho-Oh also threatens many of Latios's checks, including Arceus-Ghost, Fairies, Steel-types, and some Darkrai sets; it also greatly appreciates Latios's Defog. Steel-types, such as Klefki, Skarmory, Jirachi, Ferrothorn, and Aegislash, make for good teammates because they check Fairy- and Dragon-types by virtue of their typing. Finally, setup sweepers such as Xerneas and Swords Dance Arceus can benefit from Memento if it is used.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest move and the primary option for wallbreaking. Latios's other moves aim to provide the appropriate coverage to get past certain checks. Psyshock hits Fairies, which are immune to Draco Meteor, and special walls; it also is a STAB move that can be used if Latios does not want to incur Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. Grass Knot hits Tyranitar, Arceus-Ground, and Water-types such as Arceus-Water and Primal Kyogre for super effective damage, as well as hitting Primal Groudon reasonably hard without Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types super effectively, while Thunder can be used to hit Lugia, Ho-Oh, and other Flying-types super effectively. Lastly, Roar can prevent setup sweepers from setting up on Latios after it uses Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running a Modest nature with 252 Special Attack EVs maximizes Latios's damage output so that it can wallbreak better. Maximum Speed is necessary in order to outspeed positive-natured base 95s, such as Jolly Rayquaza. If Hidden Power Fire is not used, a Timid nature is an option to at worst tie with other Pokemon with base 110 Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Latios set is primarily a wallbreaker and should be used in a hit-and-run fashion. Switch Latios into a foe that it threatens and attack with the appropriate coverage move. Do not be afraid to make predictions in order to 2HKO certain switch-ins; however, be careful not to play too aggressively and open up a sweeping opportunity. This Latios set can check some Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, but note that it can only do so one or two times per match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers, such as Swords Dance Arceus, Geomancy Xerneas, Rock Polish Primal Groudon, and Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, make for good partners because they greatly benefit from Latios's ability to break down opposing walls. Steel-types also make for good partners because they check the Fairy- and Dragon-types that force Latios out after Latios gets a KO. Finally, entry hazards can wear down some walls for Latios, so Stealth Rock users such as Primal Groudon and Bronzong and Spikes users such as Klefki and Skarmory are good teammates for Latios.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind increases Latios's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage each, enabling Latios to set up and drop powerful boosted attacks, as well as potentially pull off a late-game sweep. Draco Meteor is Latios's primary STAB move and is extremely difficult to switch into after a Calm Mind boost or two. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that allows Latios to avoid Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop and bypass certain special walls and Fairies. Roost improves Latios's longevity, while Hidden Power allows Latios to get past most Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Latios's wallbreaking capabilities. 252 Speed EVs are needed to be able to Speed tie with other neutral-natured Pokemon with base 110 Speed and outspeed positive-natured Pokemon with base 95 Speed. If Hidden Power Fire is not used, a Timid nature can be a decent option, sacrificing some power for the ability to outspeed or at least Speed tie with other positive-natured Pokemon with base 110 Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The main emphasis of Calm Mind Latios is on wallbreaking, as very few Pokemon can take Soul Dew-boosted +1 or +2 Draco Meteors. Note that Roost gives Latios much more longevity, allowing it to check some Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre variants throughout a match; against Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, Latios can set up Calm Mind alongside it and eliminate it with Psyshock. Late-game, Calm Mind Latios can set up and potentially pull off a sweep, but this is difficult to do so because Draco Meteor lowers Latios's Special Attack and makes it easier for Latios to be forced out. Calm Mind Latios differs from all-out attacking sets in that the focus is on the raw power of a Calm Mind-boosted Draco Meteor and not on coverage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Geomancy Xerneas, Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, Swords Dance Arceus, and Rock Polish Primal Groudon are good teammates for Latios because they can clean after Latios breaks down opposing walls. Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh can punish Steel-types, which are the most common switch-ins to Latios. Steel-types such as Klefki, Bronzong, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn can check the Fairy- and Dragon-types that can threaten Latios. Finally, Fairies such as Xerneas, Klefki, and Mega Diancie check Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon that threaten Latios.</p>"

  "Kyogre": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Kyogre remains a strong threat in ORAS, the former king of Ubers has fallen very far from its throne. Previously extremely difficult to halt due to its immensely powerful, Drizzle-fueled Water-type attacks, Kyogre's longtime rival Groudon gained a new Primal Reversion that sports heavy sunlight irreversible by Drizzle and immunity to Water- and Electric-type attacks, heavily neutering Kyogre's offense and making it far easier to check. The reintroduction of Soul Dew and the transition to a more physical-attack based metagame in ORAS leave Kyogre a little high and dry in the tier. Although it gained a Primal Reversion of its own, Primal Kyogre still struggles to tango with its ubiquitous counterpart Primal Groudon and its immensely powerful Precipice Blades, as the whale does not have a way to fight back as easily without the weather on its side.</p> <p>That being said, one would be foolish to underestimate Kyogre. Its Primal Reversion is still extremely formidable, boasting STAB Water-type attacks backed by Primordial Sea and a titanic base 180 Special Attack. Further supplemented by Calm Mind and solid 100 / 160 special bulk, Primal Kyogre is a formidable wallbreaker and check to key special attackers, both roles that give it a clear niche in the metagame. Though the whale is easier to check in ORAS, it is still an enormous threat, one that Primal Groudon alone may not be enough to stop.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is rather useful at weakening all of Kyogre's checks without much need for prediction, but Kyogre usually does not have the moveslot to spare for it. Kyogre can make 101 HP Substitutes that might be useful in conjunction with Calm Mind, but it will still have difficulty breaking through Primal Groudon, which makes the loss of health not worth it. A Choice Specs set might seem tempting due to the sheer power of a boosted Water Spout, but its inability to switch moves or break Primal Groudon leaves it far inferior to simply taking advantage of Kyogre's own Primal Reversion. Similarly, Choice Scarf Kyogre may give off the impression that it can act as a threatening revenge killer and late-game cleaner, but it is completely stopped by Primal Groudon and hampered by its inability to switch moves. In addition, even if Primal Groudon is removed, Choice Scarf Kyogre simply has far too many secondary checks, such as Latios, Latias, Mega Salamence, and Giratina-O, for it to function well in Ubers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: This is by far the biggest threat to Kyogre. Thanks to Desolate Land and its typing, Primal Groudon is immune to Water- and Electric-type attacks, respectively, and takes only neutral damage from Ice Beam. In return, it can easily KO Primal Kyogre with Precipice Blades. Although Primal Kyogre can beat Primal Groudon if Primordial Sea is up, it is required to switch under the threat of Precipice Blades, which is a daunting task. Without Primordial Sea, Primal Kyogre is incapable of doing much to Primal Groudon other than chip away at it with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Latias and Latios</strong>: Latias shrugs off most of Kyogre's hits thanks to Soul Dew and easily KOes it with Psyshock. However, a Calm Mind-boosted Blizzard or Ice Beam will do significant damage to Latias. Latios is not as bulky as his sister, but his Psyshock deals much more damage to Primal Kyogre, making Latios more threatening to defensive sets.</p> <p><strong>Palkia</strong>: Palkia boasts a 4x resistance to Water-type attacks and neutrality to Ice Beam and Thunder, and its own Thunder does solid damage back to Kyogre. However, Palkia will lose to a Primal Kyogre that has a Calm Mind boost under its belt.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn can take most of Kyogre's attacks and greatly annoy it with Leech Seed and Power Whip. However, a boosted Origin Pulse from Primal Kyogre is capable of 2HKOing Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn also hates getting burned by Scald.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom has trouble switching into Origin Pulse and Ice Beam comfortably, but its Bolt Strike will deliver a swift OHKO to Primal Kyogre once it does manage to come in.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Grass</strong>: Arceus-Grass has the bulk to handle most of Kyogre's attacks and it can retaliate with Grass Knot for massive damage on Kyogre. Ice Beam stings, though, and a Calm Mind-boosted Ice Beam from Primal Kyogre can potentially KO Arceus-Grass.</p> <p><strong>Dialga</strong>: Specially defensive variants of Dialga can slow down the Calm Mind set. However, Dialga cannot defeat Calm Mind or defensive Primal Kyogre by itself.</p> <p><strong>Physically Attacking Revenge Killers</strong>: Primal Kyogre's Defense, while not bad, isn't exactly the best, leaving it prone to being picked off by strong physical attackers such as Rayquaza, Mega Salamence, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Mewtwo X. However, these threats could be in for a nasty surprise if they attempt to revenge kill physically defensive Primal Kyogre variants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Primal Kyogre has superb mixed bulk with Defense investment, making it a solid check to a wide range of Pokemon. Rest is Primal Kyogre's only form of recovery, but does allow it to shrug off status. Sleep Talk allows Primal Kyogre to fight back while asleep, and makes it a good Pokemon to absorb Dark Void from Darkrai. Scald is Primal Kyogre's STAB attack of choice due to its reliability and solid 30% chance to burn. Even with no investment in Special Attack, Scald still packs enough power to 2HKO 4 HP Arceus formes thanks to Primordial Sea. Ice Beam allows Primal Kyogre to damage Primal Groudon switch-ins and take down Mega Salamence and Rayquaza. Roar is also a fine option to phaze sweepers such as Swords Dance Arceus and rack up passive damage with entry hazards, though it leaves Primal Kyogre without a way to directly fight back against Mega Salamence and incoming Primal Groudon switch-ins.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>12 Speed EVs allow Primal Kyogre to outspeed Diancie on the turn it Mega Evolves, KOing it with Scald before it can retaliate with Diamond Storm. The leftover EVs go into HP and Defense to maximize Primal Kyogre's physical bulk, though it is still quite specially bulky. Attacks it is capable of surviving at full health include a Dragon Dance-boosted Double-Edge from Jolly Mega Salamence, a Nasty Plot-boosted Dark Pulse from Life Orb Darkrai, and a Swords Dance Life Orb-boosted Extreme Speed from Arceus.</p> <p>One can also invest in Primal Kyogre's Special Defense rather than Defense. At the expense of becoming vulnerable to physical attackers, this makes Primal Kyogre an excellent check to key special attackers such as Darkrai, Calm Mind Arceus formes, and Geomancy Xerneas assuming you have Roar to phaze it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defensive Primal Kyogre works well as a status absorber and check to threats such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Darkrai, Mega Diancie, and Calm Mind Arceus. It can also serve as an emergency check to Mega Salamence, though Primal Kyogre must have nearly full health to survive a boosted Double-Edge. As such, take care not to let Primal Kyogre get weakened too much. Do not try to stay in on Latios, Latias, or incoming Primal Groudon, as this set does not have sufficient power to break them by itself. If running Roar, use it liberally—it can really help weaken checks such as Primal Groudon with entry hazard support.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon checks should always be considered first when making a team with Primal Kyogre. Although this set does well if Primordial Sea is up, Primal Kyogre cannot deal effectively deal with Primal Groudon if Desolate Land is active, so a backup check such as Giratina-O, Latias, or Arceus-Ground is recommended. Giratina-O and Latias also provide Defog support, which is crucial as this Primal Kyogre set does not like having to deal with entry hazards. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Clefable, Xerneas, or Blissey is also very useful to help keep Primal Kyogre healthy by curing sleep and thus allowing more uses of Rest. Blissey is particularly useful for checking Palkia, which is a thorn in the side of this set. Latias and Latios checks are still required, as this set cannot effectively damage them; Mega Scizor, Aegislash, and Tyranitar are the best options, as they can KO the Eon twins with Pursuit. If running Roar, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Dialga, Klefki, and/or Ferrothorn is a must to help rack up passive damage on Primal Kyogre's checks. It is also recommended to run a backup check to Mega Salamence, as Primal Kyogre is not reliable enough at doing so to serve as a team's primary answer to it. Arceus-Rock, Shuca Berry Dialga, Lugia, and Klefki are all fine options to deal with Mega Salamence.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind + 3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Primal Kyogre's already impressive Special Attack and Special Defense stats, making it a terrifying and difficult-to-KO wallbreaker. Origin Pulse is the primary STAB attack due to its sheer power. To illustrate, Primal Kyogre is able to 2HKO Blissey and bulky Pokemon resisting Water such as specially defensive Dialga and Ferrothorn with just one Calm Mind boost, thanks to Primordial Sea. Blizzard is rather inaccurate, but it allows Primal Kyogre to OHKO Latios, Latias, and Arceus-Grass after a Calm Mind boost and Stealth Rock damage. Ice Beam is a weaker but more accurate alternative that is still able to take down the Eon twins if they've been weakened somewhat. Both Blizzard and Ice Beam also deal decent damage to Primal Groudon, which usually lacks recovery and is worn down quickly. Thunder is primarily used to take down opposing Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water, though it also has utility in spreading paralysis against faster walls such as Lugia, Latias, and Arceus. Thunder also 2HKOes Palkia after a Calm Mind boost, although Ice Beam can do this as well. If hitting opposing Kyogre is not of much concern, boosted Hidden Power Ground can do massive damage to Primal Groudon, 2HKOing even the most specially defensive variants.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>84 Speed EVs allow Primal Kyogre to outspeed anything slower than minimum Speed base 100 Pokemon, such as Jirachi, defensive Xerneas and Yveltal, and most Primal Groudon. Special Attack is maximized to deal as much damage as possible, and the rest of the EVs goes to HP to bolster Primal Kyogre's solid bulk. Fully investing in Speed is also an option, but doing so won't confer many benefits outside of outspeeding faster Primal Groudon variants.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Primal Kyogre excels at breaking down slower stall and balanced teams that can't do much to stop it from boosting. Try to set up on defensive Pokemon and weaker special attackers that can't hurt Primal Kyogre too much, such as Lugia, the Giratina formes, Scizor, defensive Dialga, defensive Yveltal, Skarmory, and support Arceus formes. Using your Ice-type move or Hidden Power Ground when you first send out Kyogre is usually a good idea if the opponent has a Primal Groudon, a usual first response to Primal Kyogre that nullifies its Primordial Sea and STAB Water-type attacks. Bear in mind that this variant of Primal Kyogre lacks recovery and can be easily worn down by residual damage—make every turn it gets count.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>It cannot be understated that Primal Groudon is a huge jerk to Primal Kyogre. Desolate Land grants Primal Groudon immunity to Water-type attacks, and it has enough bulk to take an Ice Beam or two. In return, Precipice Blades destroys Primal Kyogre, so good Primal Groudon checks are necessary. Arceus-Ground is one of the best Primal Groudon checks, capable of switching in on any attack and healing off the damage taken or simply KOing Primal Groudon with Judgment. Arceus-Ground is also a fine check to Zekrom, which otherwise greatly threatens Primal Kyogre with STAB Bolt Strike. Pokemon that are immune to Ground-type attacks, such as Giratina-O, Latias, Latios, Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and physically defensive Yveltal, all check Primal Groudon decently as well. It is also recommended to pack a Pursuit user to easily take out Latios and Latias, which can still defeat Primal Kyogre with Calm Mind and Psyshock. Mega Scizor and Aegislash are excellent options to deal with the Eon twins; as a bonus, they also tend to lure in Primal Groudon for an easy Toxic to help whittle it down, a massive boon for Primal Kyogre. In return, Primal Kyogre easily switches into Fire-type attacks thanks to Primordial Sea. Primal Kyogre also appreciates entry hazard support to help whittle down Primal Groudon and other walls. A Primal Groudon of your own is a fine Stealth Rock user, though Dialga, Tyranitar (which can also provide Pursuit support), and Landorus-T are also fine options. Spikes are readily provided by Klefki, Scolipede, Ferrothorn, or Deoxys formes. Since Primal Kyogre usually takes a lot of damage while breaking walls, pairing it with a Healing Wish user such as Latias or Jirachi to give Primal Kyogre a second chance to sweep once its checks are gone isn't a bad idea.</p> <p>Since Primal Kyogre does help weaken walls such as Primal Groudon and Blissey, Pokemon that appreciate them weakened or KOed are fine teammates. Xerneas is an excellent choice, as Primal Groudon's lack of recovery means it usually cannot handle both Xerneas and Primal Kyogre at the same time. Primal Kyogre can also easily take advantage of bulky Steel-types that bother Xerneas. Zekrom also appreciates a weakened Primal Groudon greatly, and it can use Volt Switch to help get Primal Kyogre into battle.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall hits extremely hard due to Primal Kyogre's high base 150 Attack and the power boost granted to Water-type attacks by Primordial Sea. Waterfall also has a nifty 20% flinch chance that comes in handy when facing slow walls or paralyzed foes, which is why it is used over the slightly more powerful Aqua Tail. Earthquake is mainly used to hit Primal Groudon on the switch and deals over 40% to support sets on average. It is also Primal Kyogre's best option against Ferrothorn, although it does not 3HKO Ferrothorn without prior damage. Ice Beam is used even with an Adamant nature because of its ability to reliably OHKO Mega Salamence and Rayquaza. Avalanche cannot OHKO Mega Salamence if it chooses to set up a Dragon Dance instead of immediately attack Primal Kyogre and cannot come close to OHKOing Latias on the switch, as Avalanche does not double in power unless Primal Kyogre is directly attacked that turn. Thunder Wave is used in the last slot to cripple would-be checks such as Latios, Latias, Arceus-Grass, and Arceus-Water. It also allows Primal Kyogre to check Calm Mind Arceus formes more effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Physical Primal Kyogre uses a simple maximum HP and Attack EV spread to hit as hard as possible while taking repeated blows from the special attackers it is trying to check or paralyze. The given EV spread does not use Speed investment because Primal Kyogre will ideally be slower than Primal Groudon in the lead position. In fact, Primal Kyogre can run a Brave nature and 30 Speed IVs to ensure that even Sassy Primal Groudon will be faster than it. However, 12 Speed EVs are possible if you want it to outspeed maximum Speed Diancie before it Mega Evolves, although this is not necessary, as Diancie will not stay in on Primal Kyogre anyway unless it uses Protect turn one. Primal Kyogre can also run 56 or more Speed EVs to outrun most Ho-Oh.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Primal Kyogre is a quality lead if you're expecting the opponent to lead with Primal Groudon, as it should be able to get heavy rain up by virtue of being slower. From there, it can either spam Waterfall or attempt to cripple your opponent's secondary Primal Kyogre check (which will likely switch in) with Thunder Wave. If Primal Kyogre is in on a Pokemon that it threatens, such as Arceus-Ground, and your opponent still has a healthy Primal Groudon, it can deal over 40% damage to it on the switch if you predict correctly and use Earthquake. Doing so will help either Primal Kyogre or a teammate break through it later in the match. Be careful about switching Primal Kyogre directly into Primal Groudon or Ho-Oh, as even with maximum HP, it risks getting 2HKOed by Precipice Blades from the former or Brave Bird from the latter.</p> <p>Physical Primal Kyogre can be a nasty surprise for some of Kyogre's usual switch-ins, such as Primal Groudon, Blissey, and even Latios. If your opponent has a Blissey, try not to reveal Waterfall or Earthquake until it switches in on Primal Kyogre so that Primal Kyogre can proceed to hit it extremely hard with Waterfall. If it uses a physical move before Blissey comes in, physical Primal Kyogre loses the element of surprise. This set is helpless against Ferrothorn, so double switch out of it whenever possible to Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon. Remember that, although Primordial Sea does shield Primal Kyogre from Sacred Fire and Lave Plume, it does not protect it from Will-O-Wisp, so be careful around Pokemon that commonly run the move, as a burned Primal Kyogre is essentially useless. Finally, be very careful of Yveltal, as Foul Play will do massive damage to this set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ho-Oh is an excellent offensive partner for Primal Kyogre, as it can help break down walls such as Primal Groudon and Arceus formes with Primal Kyogre while checking Shaymin-S and Ferrothorn. It also appreciates Primal Kyogre's paralysis support. Geomancy and Choice Scarf Xerneas are also good partners because Kyogre is capable of luring and dealing massive damage to some of Xerneas's checks, such as Blissey and Primal Groudon. Moreover, Primal Kyogre appreciates teammates that can check Zekrom and Latios. Primal Groudon provides an immunity to Electric-type moves and can set up Stealth Rock, while Ferrothorn resists both of Zekrom's STAB moves and has no problem checking Latias and Latios lacking Hidden Power Fire. Checks to opposing Primal Kyogre, which can threaten this Primal Kyogre set with Thunder or Scald burns, are also appreciated; Arceus-Grass and Primal Groudon take on Primal Kyogre easily.</p>"

  "Groudon": {
    "overview": "<p>The best single forme of a Pokemon in Ubers, Primal Groudon has become nigh mandatory on teams. Its absurd number of viable options along with the insane role compression it provides, both offensively and defensively, make it a Pokemon that few teams elect not to use. Primal Groudon is also notable for checking big threats such as Xerneas, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh. Blessed with very high offensive stats and solid physical bulk, Primal Groudon is considered to be the best and most common setter of Stealth Rock in the tier. Additionally, Primal Groudon has great options for boosting Speed and Attack in Rock Polish and Swords Dance, which makes it one of the most dangerous offensive threats around. Its immunity to Water- and Electric-type attacks give Primal Groudon built-in defensive synergy, while its immunity to burns makes it impossible for foes to neuter Primal Groudon's physical attacks. Primal Groudon does have some shortcomings, however, such as being stuck in an average Speed tier and having a relatively low Special Defense stat when uninvested. Primal Groudon also lacks any options for instant recovery and has its item slot restricted to the Red Orb, leaving it with few options for recovering health. Primal Groudon's primary weakness, Ground, is also a common offensive type in the tier. While Primal Groudon is far from unbeatable, it should be feared for the offensive and defense behemoth that it is.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A support Groudon with Leftovers as the item and a physically defensive EV spread can be used to check Swords Dance Arceus and offer sun support, but it is almost always inferior to Primal Groudon. Overheat is an interesting move option that deals high damage thanks to Primal Groudon's Fire typing and Desolate Land, but it is usually inferior to Lava Plume or a move such as Fire Blast that doesn't drop Special Attack. Eruption can deal a significant amount of damage to several common Primal Groudon switch-ins when it has EV investment behind it, but it becomes useless once Primal Groudon takes on damage and lacks the ability to burn targets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Immune to Ground-type moves with Multiscale and substantial physical bulk, Lugia is able to check most Primal Groudon sets well and can stall it out with a combination of Toxic, Roost, and Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Mega Salamence can lower Primal Groudon's Attack stat with Intimidate, is Ground immune, and has solid physical bulk. Offensive sets can set up Dragon Dance and hit Primal Groudon hard with boosted attacks while defensive sets can Defog away Stealth Rock and chip at Primal Groudon.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: Able to switch into most of Primal Groudon's moves and outspeed it, Arceus-Ground can smack Primal Groudon hard with Earthquake or Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon</strong>: These support Arceus formes invest heavily in Defense, resist Primal Groudon's Fire-type moves, can Defog away Stealth Rock, and can stall several Primal Groudon sets out with Toxic + Recover.</p> <p><strong>Latios and Latias</strong>: The Eon twins are faster than Primal Groudon, hold an immunity to Ground and a resistance to Fire, can Defog, and can deal significant damage with Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O is immune to Ground and resists Fire-type moves. In return, it can Defog away Primal Groudon's Stealth Rock or hit it with Draco Meteor or Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Rayquaza</strong>: Typically faster than Primal Groudon, Rayquaza is immune to Ground-type moves and can deal significant damage to Primal Groudon with Earthquake. Due to Air Lock, Rayquaza can strike Primal Groudon with Water-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre can nullify Desolate Land with its ability Primordial Sea, allowing it to OHKO Primal Groudon with Water-type attacks, but only if it has come into play after Primal Groudon has.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T</strong>: Landorus-T can lower Primal Groudon's Attack with Intimidate, is faster than Primal Groudon, and can deal heavy damage to it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Flygon</strong>: Flygon can easily take most conventional moves run by Primal Groudon and in return can Defog away Stealth Rock and stall out Primal Groudon with Toxic and Roost.</p> <p><strong>Mega Slowbro</strong>: With a combination of very high Defense, Toxic, Slack Off, and Iron Defense, Mega Slowbro can stall out certain Primal Groudon sets.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal and Shaymin-S</strong>: While they cannot switch into Primal Groudon very comfortably, Yveltal and Shaymin-S are faster than Primal Groudon, are immune to Ground-type attacks, and can deal heavy damage against it.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Bronzong</strong>: Due to Levitate, Skarmory and Bronzong can check Primal Groudon sets that do not opt to run Fire-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Groudon</strong>: A physically defensive Groudon can effectively check some Primal Groudon sets, but it is weak to Fire-type coverage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Primal Groudon can set Stealth Rock rather easily thanks to its high bulk and ability to force out a variety of Pokemon. Precipice Blades 2HKOes standard Xerneas and inflicts higher damage than Earthquake, which is important in a tier where many Pokemon are physically bulky. Lava Plume, supported by STAB and Desolate Land, deals strong damage to many Ground-immune targets, eases prediction, and can burn Pokemon such as Lugia and support Arceus formes, which makes them much easier to break in the long run. Rock Slide hits a variety of Ground-immune targets; it cannot burn like Lava Plume and runs off the Attack stat, but it OHKOes Ho-Oh.</p> <p>Roar phazes Xerneas and several other setup sweepers such as Mega Salamence, Swords Dance Arceus, and the rarer Calm Mind Arceus. It has other utility in being able to cause additional passive damage when the opponent switches to a Primal Groudon check. Thunder Wave is best used with Rock Slide, as the combination of moves does well against a variety of Ground-immune targets due to paralysis combined with the flinch rate of Rock Slide. Thunder Wave is also used to remove the Speed advantage of setup sweepers such as Xerneas and Mega Salamence. Similar to Roar but unable to phaze Xerneas, Dragon Tail has the benefit of smacking Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O switch-ins while still being able to phaze other setup sweepers such as Mega Salamence and Arceus formes. Toxic is worthwhile, as several Primal Groudon switch-ins such as Lugia, support Arceus, and Giratina-O cannot function properly when badly poisoned.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Due to having a naturally low Special Defense, this Primal Groudon set runs maximum Special Defense investment. This special bulk is helpful against key threats such as Xerneas, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Diancie. A Sassy nature is to be used with Lava Plume so that both offensive stats are left intact, as Speed is less important. If not using Lava Plume, the preferred nature becomes Careful. An Impish nature can be used to further boost Primal Groudon's physical bulk; this can be situationally helpful against threats such as Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and opposing Primal Groudon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Primal Groudon has no method of recovery and requires efficient play, especially since it is used to check several big threats such as Xerneas, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh but fails to do so when damaged. Stealth Rock needs to be set early, but not at the expense of being reckless. Lava Plume is one of the most readily clicked moves here, since it covers a variety of Primal Groudon switch-ins and spreads burns. Assume that Primal Groudon is slower than the opposing base 90 Speed Pokemon, since this set runs no investment and this Speed tier often invests. While Primal Groudon checks Ho-Oh, it does not want to switch into it, especially if it isn't running an Impish nature or Rock-type coverage. Be wary of Toxic as Primal Groudon switches in, especially against Pokemon like Klefki.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, Latios, and Latias that are able to Defog and provide a Ground immunity naturally pair well with Primal Groudon. Ho-Oh is a strong partner for this defensive Stealth Rock set due to the potency of Ho-Oh balance, Ho-Oh's ability to sponge a variety of special attacks, and its Ground immunity. Other Ground-immune teammates such as Lugia and Yveltal can make good partners on a balance team. Certain Fairy-types such as Klefki, Xerneas, and Mega Diancie provide a switch-in to Primal Groudon checks such as Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O. An appropriate Arceus forme should be run with this particular Primal Groudon, such as Arceus-Water, Extreme Killer Arceus, or Swords Dance Arceus-Ground. Mega Gengar is a strong partner choice that reaps the benefits of Primal Groudon status spam via Hex. Mega Sableye is handy for bouncing Toxic back at several common Primal Groudon checks. A Toxic immunity or Steel-type in general is useful for protecting Primal Groudon from being poisoned. Aromatherapy and Heal Bell from Xerneas or Diancie are options for removing status from Primal Groudon, while Wish or Healing Wish from Shaymin-S or Latias can give Primal Groudon an additional breath in battle.</p>"

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Primal Groudon can serve as a setter of Stealth Rock for a variety of offense arrangements thanks to its natural bulk and offensive potency. Precipice Blades is preferred for maximum damage output and can 2HKO physically bulky Xerneas, can 2HKO maximum Defense Primal Kyogre, and can OHKO opposing Primal Groudon that don't invest in Defense. Dragon Tail smacks several common Primal Groudon switch-ins and forces them back out such as Latios, Latias, Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, and support Arceus. Fire Punch cannot phaze or hit the above threats quite as hard, but it is more consistent than Dragon Tail, eases prediction, and is the only option on this set that can destroy Skarmory and Bronzong. Fire Punch also has the benefit of being almost as strong as Precipice Blades versus neutral targets while being accurate. Stone Edge OHKOes Ho-Oh and deals high damage to most other Ground-immune Pokemon. Rock Tomb can still OHKO Ho-Oh and has the benefit of lowering the Speed of opposing Pokemon by one stage, which is very useful against certain switch-ins such as Mega Salamence and Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>76 Speed EVs beat everything up to uninvested Xerneas and Yveltal. 152 HP EVs with 44 Special Defense EVs maximize the amount of HP Primal Groudon can run with the remaining EVs while still surviving a +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock. This also is enough to survive a +1 Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are slotted to Attack: 236 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature can let Primal Groudon 2HKO physically bulky Xerneas, 2HKO maximum Defense Primal Kyogre, and OHKO opposing Primal Groudon that don't invest in Defense. An EV spread of 244 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Spe with an Adamant nature sacrifices some Speed investment while still retaining Attack in order to raise the HP stat enough to where it still survives a +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas but has the benefit of higher physical bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lack of recovery, use as a setter of Stealth Rock, and use as a check to Pokemon such as Xerneas and Primal Kyogre require that Primal Groudon be played with minimal risk. Stealth Rock is best set when Primal Groudon forces a switch. Dragon Tail should be used when the opponent attempts to bring in a Defogger or thinks they have forced a switch and will set up. If you're using Fire Punch, it is generally a safe option when you are not sure what Pokemon the opponent will switch to, as it deals good damage against a variety of targets. By using Rock Tomb on the opponent's switch, Pokemon such as Latios can now be dispatched by Primal Groudon before they have a chance to attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Pokemon with a Ground immunity such as Mega Salamence, Latios, Giratina-O, and Rayquaza synergize well with this Primal Groudon set. Ho-Oh works well with this set on a bulky offense team and covers some of Primal Groudon's weaknesses to special attacks and Ground-type attacks. The appropriate Arceus forme to pair with this Primal Groudon is one that utilizes Swords Dance or another offensive technique. A Fairy-type such as Xerneas, Mega Diancie, or Klefki is desired in order to check offensive Dragon-types that threaten Primal Groudon. An offensive Ghost- or Dark-type such as Mega Gengar, Darkrai, or Yveltal can threaten key components of balanced or stall teams. Lastly, Shaymin-S can provide a Ground immunity and soft check a variety of Pokemon that threaten Primal Groudon.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish offsets Primal Groudon's lackluster Speed and turns it into one of the most dangerous setup sweepers in the tier. Precipice Blades is the preferred Ground-type STAB move, as it maximizes damage output and meets several key KOs. Although it can be difficult to set up both Swords Dance and Rock Polish, Swords Dance provides Primal Groudon with the offensive power to break certain defensive threats that Rock Polish alone cannot trump. Dragon Claw hits several Primal Groudon checks such as Latios, Latias, Giratina-O, and Flygon. Stone Edge hits most Ground-immune Pokemon for high damage such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, Mega Salamence, and Yveltal. Rock Slide can be used as Rock-type coverage for its better accuracy and flinch rate. Fire Punch's low Base Power is mitigated by STAB and Desolate Land, and the move works in lieu of Rock-type coverage to take out Ground-immune Steel-types while still hitting most other Ground-immune targets hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature maximize damage output and allow Primal Groudon to OHKO opposing Primal Groudon that don't run Defense investment, OHKO defensive Primal Kyogre with Precipice Blades at +2, and OHKO standard Mega Salamence with Stone Edge when at +1. 56 Speed EVs are used so that Primal Groudon will be faster than base 90 Choice Scarf users when at +2. The remaining EVs maximize physical bulk while still enabling Primal Groudon to survive +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock; the physical bulk is also sufficient to survive a +1 Adamant Double-Edge from Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock. An EV spread of 208 Atk / 144 SpD / 156 Spe with an Adamant nature makes +2 Primal Groudon faster than +1 252 Mega Salamence and standard +2 Xerneas. This EV spread still survives a +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock. An EV spread of 248 HP / 204 Atk / 56 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used with a set that features Swords Dance for higher mixed bulk. This spread also survives a +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock and a +1 Adamant Mega Salamence Double-Edge after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Setting up Rock Polish or Swords Dance is best when forcing a switch. Setup can be accomplished without forcing a switch due to Primal Groudon's natural bulk, but this should only be done when the ensuing trade is assured to be beneficial. If using both Rock Polish and Swords Dance, set up one first on a forced switch and then boost the other stat while surviving the ensuing attack. Focus on checking opposing threats without letting this set sponge attacks so that Primal Groudon has enough bulk to set up or keep from being revenge killed. If this set is used as the wincon, focus on pressuring the opposing Pokemon that need to be damaged or eliminated in order for Primal Groudon to successfully clean.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>An offensive Stealth Rock setter is a mandatory partner with this set, with some examples including Deoxys-S, Dialga, Excadrill, Mega Diancie, Tyranitar, and Mega Aerodactyl. An offensive teammate with a Ground immunity such as Mega Salamence or Rayquaza is desired to offset Primal Groudon's weakness to Ground. The appropriate Arceus forme to pair with Rock Polish Primal Groudon is one that runs Swords Dance or one that runs another form of offensive set. An offensive Fairy-type such as Xerneas or Mega Diancie is desired for the immunity to Draco Meteor and ability to keep offensive Dragon- and Dark-types in check. An offensive Ghost- or Dark-type such as Mega Gengar, Darkrai, or Yveltal is effective for pressuring defensive components of certain teams.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This Primal Groudon set functions as both an entry hazard setter and a stallbreaker by offsetting its low natural Speed with high investment. Swords Dance doubles Primal Groudon's Attack, allowing it to 2HKO most Pokemon in the tier. Precipice Blades is the best STAB move for this set, as it maximizes damage output. The remaining slot is used for Rock-type coverage to hit Ground-immune targets. Stone Edge is preferred for its higher power. Rock Slide can also be used due to being slightly more consistent and this Primal Groudon being fast enough to make use of the flinch effects.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>196 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are sufficient to outspeed fully invested base 90 Speed Pokemon and below. 144 Special Defense EVs are used in order to survive a +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are slotted into the Attack stat. An EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature maximizes Primal Groudon's Speed and runs more Attack at the cost of not meeting the +2 Xerneas benchmark.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used on balance or bulky offense teams that need to combine a Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker into one teamslot. Set up Stealth Rock when forcing a switch, and set it early. This Primal Groudon can also bluff a support set or an offensive Stealth Rock set so long as it hasn't revealed Swords Dance yet. Set up Swords Dance against an incoming Defog Arceus or if you manage to force a switch while Stealth Rock is up. If a Pokemon that can successfully Defog against this set even when it is boosted is going to switch in, double switch to a Pokemon that won't allow it to Defog. In order to function as a check to Pokemon such as Geomancy Xerneas, this Primal Groudon must remain healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>An alternative setup sweeper such as Swords Dance Arceus, Geomancy Xerneas, or Mega Salamence pairs well with this set and serves to increase a team's ability to strip down opposing defensive cores. Ground-immune or Water-resistant teammates such as Latios, Latias, Mega Salamence, and Giratina-O provide Primal Groudon with needed support against common Ground-type attacks and against Primal Kyogre. Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Klefki, and Mega Diancie are partners that are able to check Dragon-types that threaten Primal Groudon. A Steel-type such as Jirachi or Ferrothorn is able to simultaneously serve as a check to Latios and Xerneas. Jirachi can support Primal Groudon with Wish, while Ferrothorn benefits from this Primal Groudon's ability to take down anti-entry hazard cores employed by passive teams. Ferrothorn also supports Primal Groudon by being able to handle Primal Kyogre well. Offensive Ghost- or Dark-types such as Mega Gengar, Giratina-O, Darkrai, and Yveltal can check certain offensive Psychic-types and also stallbreak well. A secondary Xerneas check such as Ho-Oh, Klefki, or Bronzong is also desired, as this Primal Groudon doesn't have much room for taking damage without losing its ability to check Xerneas.</p>"
      },
      "Paradancer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rather than boosting Speed or running high investment in the Speed stat, this set uses Thunder Wave to gain the Speed advantage against opposing threats. The move also has use against Primal Groudon switch-ins such as Latios, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza and is used to check Xerneas. Swords Dance allows Primal Groudon to deal massive damage against Pokemon such as support Arceus, Lugia, Primal Kyogre, and Pokemon that typically fall short of being OHKOed by unboosted Primal Groudon. Rock Slide is used as the coverage move, which hits most Ground-immune targets well. Combined with the paralysis induced by Thunder Wave, the flinch rate of Rock Slide makes it difficult for targets to move successfully. Precipice Blades is the strongest Ground-type STAB move available and meets important KOs against some of the aforementioned threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>EVs maximize the Attack stat and the 12 Speed EVs make Primal Groudon faster than Mega Diancie before Mega Evolution. The remaining EVs maximize mixed bulk and allow Primal Groudon to survive a +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock and a +1 Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock. An EV spread of 152 HP / 236 Atk / 44 SpD / 76 Spe with an Adamant nature sacrifices some Attack investment in order to outspeed uninvested Xerneas and Yveltal. This spread also lets Primal Groudon survive a +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock and a +1 Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set functions less as a wincon and more as an intermediate wallbreaker, so focus on dismantling cores with Thunder Wave and +2 boosted attacks. Thunder Wave combined with Primal Groudon's bulk can be used to emergency check a variety of setup sweepers when facing offense teams. Focus on paralyzing faster defensive Pokemon first and setting up Swords Dance later. With their Speed advantage eliminated, Primal Groudon can break through several Pokemon when at +2 Attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this Primal Groudon set doesn't have room for Stealth Rock, an alternate setter such as Dialga, Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, Excadrill, or Bronzong is required. An alternative setup sweeper such as Swords Dance Arceus, Geomancy Xerneas, Mega Salamence, or Rayquaza can greatly benefit from this Primal Groudon's ability to weaken their checks. Pokemon that are immune Ground and resist Water such as Latios, Latias, Mega Salamence, and Giratina-O cover Primal Groudon's most exploitable weaknesses. A secondary Xerneas check such as Ho-Oh, Klefki, or Bronzong is desired, as this Primal Groudon can be worn down and left unable to check Xerneas on its own. Zekrom is useful for threatening physically defensive Pokemon such as Arceus-Water and Lugia as well as threaten Mega Salamence and Primal Kyogre. A Healing Wish user such as Latias or Shaymin-S can give Primal Groudon a second chance to bust through the opposing team.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set utilizes Primal Groudon's large Special Attack in conjunction with the Speed-boosting effects of Rock Polish to create a setup sweeper that is effective against a variety of typical Primal Groudon checks. With maximum Special Attack investment and the effects of Desolate Land, Fire Blast deals more damage than Precipice Blades on this set. Fire Blast is notable for usually OHKOing defensive Yveltal after Stealth Rock, dealing upwards of 87% against Arceus-Ground, and 2HKOing Lugia after Stealth Rock. Dragon Pulse usually OHKOes Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock, and it 2HKOes Giratina-O, Latios, and Flygon. Precipice Blades is used handle Primal Kyogre, Blissey, and Rock-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs ensure that Primal Groudon is faster than Choice Scarf base 90 Pokemon after using Rock Polish. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Mild nature maximize the damage output of Fire Blast and Dragon Pulse. The nature is chosen as Mild so that it does not impair the damage output of Precipice Blades. 144 Special Defense EVs allow Primal Groudon to survive a +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are slotted into Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is only to be used for certain offense teams that appreciate its ability to beat certain otherwise solid Primal Groudon checks. Precipice Blades should be used to bluff a physical set or one that isn't highly invested in offensive stats. Setting up is best when forcing a switch against a Steel-type. While it can also be done when not forcing a switch thanks to Primal Groudon's natural bulk, this should only be done when necessary. This set is not really intended to check big threats except when absolutely necessary, so teammates should sponge attacks instead so that Primal Groudon has enough bulk to set up or keep from being revenge killed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>An offensive Stealth Rock setter such as Deoxys-S, Dialga, Excadrill, Mega Diancie, Tyranitar, or Mega Aerodactyl is required, as this Primal Groudon does not have room for the move. An additional entry hazard setter, one that can lay Spikes or Toxic Spikes, is especially helpful for breaking down threats for this set. A Ground-immune teammate such as Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, or Shaymin-S helps cover Primal Groudon's weakness to Ground. Offensive Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Mega Diancie help cover Latios, and Ghost- or Dark-types such as Mega Gengar, Arceus-Ghost, Darkrai, and Yveltal help threaten the physically defensive backbones of teams.</p>"
      },
      "Rest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest is Primal Groudon's best method of recovering HP on its own. Passive teams often rely on poison or other residual damage to take down Primal Groudon, making this set a potential stallbreaker. Sleep Talk is used so that Primal Groudon's sleeping turns aren't a total loss. Lava Plume hits several Ground-immune targets well and spreads burns that are irritating for several common Primal Groudon checks. Precipice Blades is the primary STAB move, dealing solid damage against Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre, opposing Primal Groudon, Steel-types, and Rock-types despite the Attack stat being uninvested. Roar is used to prevent the opposing Pokemon from boosting stats. It also allows this set to phaze Geomancy Xerneas consistently. Stone Edge can also be used as a coverage move, primarily for teams that struggle against Ho-Oh, but it also has use against some other Ground-immune targets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The maximum Special Defense investment offsets Primal Groudon's lackluster natural special bulk. This investment is also helpful against key threats such as Xerneas, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Diancie. A Sassy nature is to be used with Lava Plume so that both offensive stats are left intact, as Speed isn't especially important for this set. If you're not using Precipice Blades, the preferred nature becomes Calm. An Impish nature can be used to further boost Primal Groudon's physical bulk; this can be situationally helpful against threats such as Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and opposing Primal Groudon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Primal Groudon should be played similarly to the defensive Stealth Rock set, except that it doesn't have to worry quite as much when it comes to taking damage, since it can recover with Rest. Use this set to sponge status against Pokemon that rely on Toxic alone to break Primal Groudon. Understand that a sleeping Primal Groudon is mostly useless even with Sleep Talk; this can be reduced to a single turn by Resting and then creating an opening for cleric use. Maintain enough breathing room to Rest again by burning sleep turns against Pokemon that can't deal much damage to Primal Groudon while it is immune to Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A reliable defensive Stealth Rock setter such as Tyranitar is a must for teams that utilize this Primal Groudon set. A Ground-immune Pokemon such as Lugia, Mega Salamence, Latios, or Latias is also needed for proper defensive support. A support Arceus is typically paired with this set, one example being Arceus-Water. Mega Sableye pairs well with Primal Groudon, as it can handle several Primal Groudon checks, can bounce entry hazards, and fits well on defensive teams. A backup check to Primal Kyogre is greatly desired if this set forgoes running Precipice Blades, as the only thing Primal Groudon can do against it is Roar. Spikes support from Ferrothorn, Skarmory, or Klefki pairs well when this set runs Roar to rack up residual damage. A cleric is a good idea so that Primal Groudon can be awakened and spend fewer turns wasted when asleep.</p>"

  "Rayquaza": {
    "overview": "<p>With Mega Rayquaza ascending to the land of Anything Goes due to being too powerful, its base forme still finds itself able to tear up all manners of bulky teams in Ubers without being dead weight against offense thanks to Extreme Speed. Rayquaza's new signature move, Dragon Ascent, gives it a 120-Base Power Flying-type STAB move, something it had been lacking until ORAS's release. Dragon Ascent alone makes Rayquaza a terrifying wallbreaker able to 2HKO any physical wall that does not resist it with only one viable exception in Multiscale Lugia. Rayquaza's moveset options are also exceptional, with moves such as V-create, Draco Meteor, Extreme Speed, and Earthquake to hit any would-be checks as well as boosting moves in Dragon Dance and Swords Dance. Air Lock gives Rayquaza the rare ability to hit Primal Groudon with Water-type moves by negating Desolate Land. Due to this, along with resistances to Water and Fire and a Ground-type immunity, Rayquaza finds itself on offensive teams that appreciate a soft check to both Primals, as well as wallbreaking capabilities and revenge killing utility with Extreme Speed. Rayquaza's defensive stats, weakness to Stealth Rock, and longevity issues due to requiring a Life Orb in most cases mean that boosting sets are typically niche options; the upfront wallbreaking power of MixQuaza and Choice Band sets are generally more appreciated among Ubers teams. A slower metagame due to threats such as Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence also helps in Rayquaza's favor, as this means support Arceus formes are likely to be slower than Jolly Rayquaza, compromising their effectiveness as switch-ins.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Rayquaza has many usable options, the large majority of them are outclassed by the standard sets. Choice Scarf is an interesting option, turning Rayquaza away from a wallbreaker and more towards a dedicated revenge killer. Dragon Ascent also gives Rayquaza a spammable cleanup option for a Choice Scarf set. Choice Scarf Rayquaza is able to outspeed everything up to Mega Mewtwo Y and even some Deoxys-A sets. The main reason as to why it is niche is because Rayquaza is far better suited to being a wallbreaker. Lum Berry can prove to be useful in situations such as switching into Lava Plume Primal Groudon and taking a Dark Void from Darkrai. Using Lum Berry over Life Orb sacrifices a lot of power just for a surprise factor, however, and is inconsistent as a result. Focus Sash lets Rayquaza lead without fear and immediately tear holes into the enemy team, and thanks to Air Lock, the Focus Sash cannot be broken by sandstorm damage. It also allows Rayquaza to survive encounters it otherwise would not, such as when facing any Pokemon naturally faster than it. Being weak to Stealth Rock can cause a big deal of unreliability in keeping the Focus Sash intact, however, and the lack of Life Orb really shows when facing bulkier teams. Aqua Tail is a secondary option over Waterfall for Charti Berry Rayquaza, as it is able to 2HKO Arceus-Rock after Stealth Rock damage while dealing more damage than Waterfall to Primal Groudon. Dragon Tail is a niche option that can rack up entry hazard damage, as well as break Lugia's Multiscale and force it out again. This means that if it switches back into Dragon Ascent, it will be 2HKOed. This is a fairly niche move to use, and other moves are generally more consistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia with Multiscale intact is the easiest way to deal with any Rayquaza set. Most Lugia EV spreads are only fast enough to outrun Adamant Rayquaza, however, and if Stealth Rock is up, Lugia is cleanly 2HKOed by Dragon Ascent.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Arceus</strong>: Common support Arceus formes such as Water, Dragon, and Rock are all able to run enough Speed to outrun the fastest of Rayquaza sets and neuter any wallbreaking potential from it. If they do not have the Speed investment to outspeed Jolly Rayquaza, they are in for a surprise. Arceus-Rock is the ideal stop to most sets, as it requires both prior damage and a predicted Earthquake on the switch for Rayquaza to have a chance at beating it. Dragon Dance Rayquaza does not have this problem.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Rayquaza is actually very hard to wall, but offensive teams in particular give Rayquaza little room. Naturally faster Pokemon such as Latios, Mewtwo, and Mega Salamence are all able to revenge kill Rayquaza, while priority attacks from the likes of Giratina-O, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Deoxys-A are able to revenge kill a weakened Rayquaza.</p> <p><strong>Shuca Berry Users</strong>: The prevalence of Mega Salamence and Primal Groudon has increased the usage of Shuca Berry on some Pokemon. Unfortunately, these Pokemon also have the advantage of a good matchup against Rayquaza. Common users include Dialga, Zekrom, and Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, Primal Kyogre, and Primal Groudon are usually able to take at least one hit from Rayquaza when healthy and either KO it or cripple it with a status move. None of them are able to actually switch into Rayquaza without being 2HKOed, however.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Bronzong</strong>: Skarmory and Bronzong take a risk in switching into Rayquaza for fear of V-create, but any sets that lack the move are easily checked by them.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "MixQuaza (Mixed Attacker)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>MixQuaza returns better than ever due to the new addition of Dragon Ascent to its movepool. The strong combination of Dragon Ascent and Draco Meteor allows Rayquaza to 2HKO support Arceus formes and Primal Groudon, putting massive holes into the enemy team for another teammate to clean up later on. V-create eliminates Skarmory and most other Steel-types as checks while also hitting Dialga without worrying about Shuca Berry shenanigans. Earthquake is a secondary option if hitting Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Arceus-Rock is of more concern, but Arceus-Rock still wins against this set due to being faster, and Tyranitar commonly holds a Shuca Berry. Extreme Speed is a necessity to prevent weakened faster Pokemon picking up a free KO against Rayquaza and can also pick off weakened Arceus before they use Recover, as well as other threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack puts maximum power behind Dragon Ascent, as this is the most spammable option on the set. It should be noted that without an Attack-boosting nature, Dragon Ascent will fall short of the 2HKO on support Arceus formes. A Naive nature with 216 Speed EVs allows Rayquaza to be faster than standard support Arceus sets. The remaining 40 EVs go into Special Attack to give a small boost to Draco Meteor and increase the chances of 2HKOing support Arceus with the combination of Draco Meteor and Dragon Ascent. Life Orb adds even more power to the set, but be wary of the recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>MixQuaza is great for weakening walls and bulky Pokemon or just outright KOing them. When it comes to both Primal Pokemon, Primal Groudon can have a hard time with Rayquaza depending on the Groudon's set, but Primal Kyogre is a highly dangerous threat to switch into, as Ice Beam is more often than not the attack of choice for it. Keep Rayquaza around against offensive teams, as you will likely need it to finish off a highly dangerous threat such as Geomancy Xerneas, Darkrai, or Deoxys-A with Extreme Speed. MixQuaza does have longevity issues and as should thus be used in a fire-and-forget style of play, as almost all of the moves on this set come with nasty stat drops, potentially giving a turn of setup away to the opponent. Resistances to Fire and Water as well as a Ground-type immunity can give Rayquaza chances to switch in, but be very careful of status moves such as Thunder Wave or repeated hits, as Rayquaza is not very bulky and is dead weight if hit by paralysis. Draco Meteor and Dragon Ascent make a potent combination that is likely to take out any wall besides Multiscale Lugia. Fairy-types and Steel-types can be exceptions, but the coverage options on this set are capable of dealing with them. Be aware of faster support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water or a fast Lugia; sometimes these Pokemon run more Speed than usual for the purposes of catching Rayquaza. Learn Rayquaza's damage against the full bulk spreads of these Pokemon to better predict a course of action, or risk losing Rayquaza to a fast wall. This particular set is a great anti-lead to Deoxys-S, as Draco Meteor plus Extreme Speed can keep it to one layer of entry hazards. If Rayquaza gets in safely, it can easily force switches. Predicting between Draco Meteor and Dragon Ascent is simple; when in doubt, click Dragon Ascent. Nearly all Pokemon that resist it are slower, leaving them susceptible to coverage options on the next turn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters, specifically Spikes leads, can pair very well with this set. This is because Rayquaza can heavily pressure nearly all Defog or Rapid Spin users while also forcing switches to rack up entry hazard damage. Cloyster is a notable example of such—it can set either form of Spikes and anti-lead other setters by spinning their entry hazards away. A secondary Dragon-type actually works well with Rayquaza; something like Latios can hit bulky Arceus formes too, as well as deal with Arceus-Rock, something that MixQuaza loses to. Latios appreciates the damage Rayquaza can do against sand teams, while Rayquaza can also roll over the Steel-types that usually wall Latios. Mega Salamence can be a great partner, as it provides a secondary Primal Groudon check, and due to Rayquaza and Salamence sharing the same checks, Rayquaza breaking down a check can make it easier for Salamence to sweep later on. Refresh Salamence pairs best with MixQuaza, as Rayquaza's coverage can free up the Earthquake slot on Salamence for Refresh. Both of them give redundant defensive synergy together, however, and this combination should only be considered on hyper offensive teams as a result. Arceus-Ghost and Mega Gengar make great teammates, as Extreme Speed users such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Deoxys-A can threaten to revenge kill Rayquaza. Both of these Pokemon are also decent Extreme Killer Arceus checks. With Rayquaza able to take out common defensive walls in Arceus-Water, Giratina-O, and Lugia, just about anything that has trouble with them appreciates having Rayquaza as a partner. This can include Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh, to name a few. Rayquaza's coverage options can limit synergy with teammates. For example, Earthquake Rayquaza is annoyed by Skarmory, while V-create Rayquaza isn't. This means that teammates such as Swords Dance Arceus would much rather have V-create Rayquaza as a partner.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Ascent backed by a Choice Band puts out ridiculous damage, being able to outright OHKO Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre, Latias, Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock damage. Not even Pokemon that resist it are safe, as Tyranitar and Mega Diancie are 2HKOed with little prior damage. The biggest reason to use Choice Band Dragon Ascent is the ability to 2HKO support Arceus formes without the need for boosting moves, Draco Meteor, or an Adamant nature to do so. Earthquake is best used on predicted switch-ins, as it is able to OHKO Mega Diancie, as well as Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock after Stealth Rock damage. Arceus-Rock needs a little prior damage on it to secure the Earthquake OHKO, however. No Ubers-viable Steel-type is able to take a Choice Band V-create and live, with Dialga being the sole exception. Extreme Speed's power also receives a nice boost, widening the range that Rayquaza is able to revenge kill weakened threats from.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment is standard, giving Rayquaza the tools to put out maximum damage and outspeed most support Arceus formes. A huge draw to using this set is that it is the set that can most comfortably get away with using a Jolly nature without sacrificing power. This gives Rayquaza the ability to outspeed standard support Arceus and therefore 2HKO them on the switch, nullifying them as checks. The Speed boost also comes in useful against Excadrill and offensive Yveltal sets and ensures that Rayquaza will outspeed even the fastest of Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon sets before any boosts. An Adamant nature is an option and comes with some extra perks; Dragon Ascent now has a good chance to 2HKO Zekrom, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie after Stealth Rock damage as well as a 50% chance to outright OHKO Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock and a near 70% chance to OHKO Geomancy Xerneas after entry hazard damage. Earthquake will also now have a 25% chance to OHKO Arceus-Rock after Stealth Rock damage, and Extreme Speed's power now matches that of Jolly Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus. The major downside is being unable to outspeed standard Lugia and support Arceus, but if you fear an opponent will invest more Speed into them to outspeed Jolly Rayquaza, it may be worth considering.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Rayquaza is best used as an early- or mid game wallbreaker, luring in and eliminating typical physical walls such as Arceus-Water and Lugia. This can pave the way for teammates to sweep later in the match. Generally, burns and paralysis turn this set into dead weight, especially if Pokemon such as Arceus-Water and Lugia are still around. Sometimes it can be worth it, however, such as taking a Thunder Wave in exchange for taking out a Klefki. This can open doors for teammates such as Geomancy Xerneas to freely set up or for Latios to start its own wallbreaking. Size up the situations and make sure any sacrifices are worth it. Keeping up entry hazards can make Rayquaza's life easier. Aggressive double switches where appropriate and punishing any attempts to remove entry hazards from their side is key to victory with this set. As this set is using a Choice item, ensure that you are making the right moves. Using anything other than Dragon Ascent or mispredicting a switch can cause massive losses in momentum if you get it wrong.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Typical Rayquaza partners such as Mega Salamence, Mega Diancie, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground all fit well here. Entry hazard setters are always good, with Stealth Rock ensuring many 2HKOs and OHKOs against various Pokemon; Deoxys, Dialga, and Primal Groudon are good setters. Darkrai is an optional teammate, as it is able to deal with a large majority of entry hazard removers. Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O provide effective switch-ins to most forms of priority. Rock Polish Primal Groudon in particular is an effective teammate, as it loves how easily Rayquaza can break down physical walls that may stop a late-game sweep.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rayquaza can take the route of a late-game cleaner and improve its matchup against offensive teams thanks to Dragon Dance. The Speed boost can come in useful against faster targets such as Darkrai, Mega Gengar, Mewtwo, and importantly Arceus-Rock, a Pokemon that any other Rayquaza set has trouble with. Dragon Ascent at +1 outclasses the power of Choice Band Rayquaza due to the Life Orb boosts, OHKOing threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Xerneas, even without entry hazard damage. Extreme Speed retains revenge killing utility in cases where setting up a Dragon Dance against a threat is not possible; however, it can also prove useful even at +1 Speed, as it allows Rayquaza to hit revenge killers such as Deoxys-A and Extreme Killer Arceus with its own Extreme Speed first. Earthquake is preferred over V-create on this set due to V-create's Speed drop acting counterproductive to a Dragon Dance set. Ideally, checks hit only by V-create such as Skarmory and Bronzong should be removed or sufficiently weakened before Rayquaza comes in. Waterfall is an alternative option and must be used alongside a Charti Berry for the best results. This combination gives Rayquaza some defensive utility for a team, allowing it to check threatening Ground-type sweepers such as Arceus-Ground, Excadrill, and Rock Polish Primal Groudon. Air Lock allows Rayquaza to hit Primal Groudon with Waterfall by negating Desolate Land. Dragon Ascent hits Arceus-Ground and other Pokemon only 2x weak to Water harder than Waterfall, however. Charti Berry Rayquaza has a large lack of power compared to any other set, and as a result, it will not be as great of a sweeper as usual.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are standard, while Life Orb adds maximum damage behind Rayquaza's attacks. Charti Berry should only be considered on teams that find themselves very weak to Ground-type Pokemon or would enjoy extra insurance against them. Jolly nature is preferred due to the ability to outspeed common support Arceus without a Dragon Dance boost, whereas Adamant is an option if extra power is wanted. An Adamant Life Orb-boosted Dragon Ascent can 2HKO standard Arceus-Water, for example. Charti Berry sets absolutely need Adamant to avoid being too weak, and be aware that using an Adamant nature leaves Rayquaza slower than Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl at +1 Speed and is also likely to be slower than support Arceus and Lugia before boosts. 29 HP IVs minimize Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragon Dance Rayquaza can be used as an early- to mid game wallbreaker until a team is sufficiently weakened enough to clean up with Dragon Dance later on. Extreme Speed can take care of weakened threats to Rayquaza's team at any stage of the match. Be aware that healthy walls such as Arceus-Water and Lugia are able to survive even boosted Dragon Ascents and KO Rayquaza, hence why this set is best at cleaning up once its checks are sufficiently weakened. Intimidate users such as bulky Salamence and Choice Scarf Landorus-T are also able to mess with Rayquaza and should be avoided until they are sufficiently weakened. An unboosted Jolly Rayquaza can prove to be weaker than expected. Pokemon such as support Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes are able to survive two Dragon Ascents if they have to. Add this to the difficulty of setting up Dragon Dance without being punished in the first place, and you find that this set ends up being better at softening up the enemy team for other teammates to sweep, rather than sweeping itself. Bear in mind that the Rock Polish Primal Groudon sets that Charti Berry Rayquaza is intended to check could be running Dragon Claw or Dragon Pulse, either of which will OHKO Rayquaza after Stealth Rock damage. Ideal setup targets for this set are almost nonexistent, but forcing switches is always a way to get a Dragon Dance boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shadow Tag users such as Mega Gengar are especially good partners for this set, as Dragon Dance Rayquaza cannot break Arceus-Water and Lugia as well as other Rayquaza sets. Primal Groudon is a great option for setting up Stealth Rock and can also run Fire-type coverage such as Lava Plume and Fire Punch to help Rayquaza against Skarmory and Bronzong. Klefki can spread paralysis and set Spikes to help Rayquaza against Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and support Arceus formes. Charti Berry Rayquaza appreciates Stealth Rock removal, as Rock Polish Primal Groudon can work around the Charti Berry with Dragon-type coverage, able to OHKO Rayquaza after Stealth Rock damage. Entry hazard removal can come from Defog users such as Latios, Rapid Spin users such as Excadrill, or Magic Bounce users such as Mega Diancie.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance really amplifies Rayquaza's already strong wallbreaking abilities. A +2 Dragon Ascent has a 75% chance to outright OHKO standard support Arceus-Water after Stealth Rock damage, for example. Swords Dance combined with Extreme Speed also prevents Rayquaza from being revenge killed by faster frail Pokemon, as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Mega Mewtwo Y are all likely to be OHKOed by a +2 Extreme Speed. V-create is preferred over Earthquake here, as a Speed drop is not necessarily a worry thanks to the stronger Extreme Speeds. Earthquake can be used to hit Tyranitar and Mega Diancie while retaining coverage against most Steel-types, but Rayquaza then struggles more against Skarmory and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed combined with a Life Orb offer the best wallbreaking potential, and a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed support Arceus formes. 29 HP IVs minimize Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance Rayquaza is a true terror to stall teams as well as balance teams that lack Pokemon that outspeed it and can also survive a +2 Extreme Speed, such as Latias. Nothing on common stall teams can take on a Swords Dance-boosted Rayquaza, with Multiscale Lugia being the only exception. Accordingly, avoid taking on Lugia if Multiscale is still intact. Setting up a Swords Dance can prove to be tricky, as many defensive Pokemon all have ways to punish foes attempting to set up on them, with status moves being the most common option. The ideal scenario is to force a Pokemon to Recover or Rest or even predict the setup of entry hazards to set up a Swords Dance. Taking a Toxic as Rayquaza uses Swords Dance is still a win for Rayquaza, however, as it can now punch holes in the enemy team until it goes down, leaving room for another teammate to get going. A common tactic for stall teams is to switch around into Pokemon that resist Rayquaza's predicted move or use moves such as Protect and Fake Out to stall long enough for Toxic damage to KO Rayquaza, so be aware of this strategy. Thunder Wave should be avoided, however, as now some stall Pokemon such as Arceus-Water can revenge kill Rayquaza if they get in safely, which should only happen if something else is sacrificed. This set has more of an issue with offensive teams, as setting up a Swords Dance can prove very difficult, and even if that happens, the reliance on Extreme Speed can prove to be Rayquaza's downfall. Both Dragon Ascent and V-create come with annoying stat drops that can make revenge killing Rayquaza much easier. Switching out of incoming revenge killers is the best play if the stat drops become an issue.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Both offensive teams and balanced teams alike appreciate the insane wallbreaking potential of Swords Dance Rayquaza. A core of Mega Diancie and Ho-Oh can work very well, with Mega Diancie able to keep Mega Sableye and Lugia in check, as well as keep entry hazards away thanks to Magic Bounce. Ho-Oh doubles down on the physical pressure alongside Rayquaza, and teams can be very hard pressed to keep both of them down over the course of a match. Primal Groudon can also be used as a Stealth Rock setter, giving Rayquaza the means to secure vital OHKOs on support Arceus formes and Lugia, and can also add extra wallbreaking power if necessary by using Swords Dance itself. Other Stealth Rock setters such as Dialga can also be used in situations that call for a more offensive Primal Groudon set. Klefki can annoy Lugia, use Thunder Wave to paralyze faster Pokemon that may check Rayquaza, and set Spikes to punish the switches that this set is bound to force. Adding more physical threats such as Mega Salamence and Arceus-Ground is an option, as they can overload each other's checks as the match goes on. Other typical offensive Pokemon such as Xerneas, Extreme Killer Arceus, Darkrai, and Mega Gengar can also make effective partners, as they work well against opposing offensive teams.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's typing allows it to competently check Fairy-types, as well as deal with Latias and Latios, thanks to Jirachi's secondary Psychic typing also giving it a quadruple resistance to Psyshock. Serene Grace alongside Iron Head only helps Jirachi to check various Pokemon, and rare support moves such as Healing Wish and Wish are fantastic, with U-turn, Ice Punch, and Fire Punch all useful as well. Solid 100 base stats across the board bolster Jirachi's durability, with base 100 Speed also being above-average in Ubers.</p> <p>However, weaknesses to Ground, Ghost, Dark, and Fire are very exploitable in a metagame where Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ghost, Ho-Oh, and several Dark-types appear on the majority of teams, and being bait for Primal Groudon in particular can cause Jirachi several problems. Its middling base 100 Attack and low Base Power moves mean that Jirachi can struggle to deal heavy damage to opposing Pokemon, even with super effective attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stealth Rock is somewhat usable on the support set, but finding room for it is next to impossible, and there are several other, more viable setters in the Ubers tier. Trick on the Choice Scarf set can work, but there are a multitude of items, such as Arceus Plates, Red Orb, Blue Orb, and Griseous Orb, that cannot be Tricked away, making it a very risky option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Primal Groudon can OHKO Jirachi with either of its physical STAB moves while Ho-Oh can do so with Sacred Fire or Earthquake boosted by either Choice Band or Life Orb. All Fire-types in Ubers can wall Jirachi and eventually KO it with their STAB moves. Primal Groudon is also immune to Thunder Wave, meaning it can set up on support sets lacking Body Slam. Blaziken easily KOes Jirachi with Flare Blitz, but must be careful not to be caught by Thunder Wave or a paralysis from Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Scizor can consistently damage Jirachi with either Pursuit or Knock Off while most Jirachi can do nothing to it. Ferrothorn easily beats Choice Scarf Jirachi with Leech Seed and Iron Barbs and can easily beat the support set one-on-one as well. Both are 2HKOed by Fire Punch, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Primal and regular Groudon, Landorus-T, Arceus-Ground, and Excadrill all wall Jirachi and can easily beat it one on one with their super effective STAB moves. Arceus-Ground and Excadrill are both crippled by a well-timed paralysis from Body Slam, however.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost have the ability to beat both Jirachi sets, with the former being able to bypass any flinch chance from Iron Head thanks to its super effective priority Shadow Sneak. However, Arceus-Ghost must be wary of being paraflinched by the support set, and Giratina-O cannot take too many Iron Heads either due to its lack of recovery. Mega Gengar can trap support Jirachi should it not carry Thunder Wave, and can deal heavy damage with Shadow Ball, but is crippled by Thunder Wave and gets promptly flinched to death by Iron Head. Should Mega Gengar not carry Shadow Ball, Jirachi will also easily be able to U-turn out of it and into a Pursuit trapper.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Yveltal easily beats Jirachi with its STAB Dark Pulse or Foul Play, as well as OHKOing Choice Scarf Jirachi with Sucker Punch. Darkrai needs to watch out because it is outsped by Choice Scarf Jirachi and can also be caught by Thunder Wave as it switches in, but can either put Jirachi to sleep or beat up on Jirachi with Life Orb Dark Pulse. Arceus-Dark has very good odds of beating Jirachi with both Refresh and Recover.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Iron Head gives Jirachi utility in checking Fairy-types and going for fast, Serene Grace-augmented flinches, which can turn around bad matchups in dire circumstances. U-turn provides switch initiative against the extremely dangerous Pokemon that commonly switch into Jirachi, with the most notable being Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Healing Wish allows Jirachi to give many offensive Pokemon a second chance to run through the opponent's team after having been weakened by its first run. It can usually do this successfully due to its Choice Scarf allowing it to outrun the entire unboosted metagame besides Deoxys-S. Ice Punch is for revenge killing Rayquaza and unboosted Mega Salamence. Ice Punch also hits offensive Landorus-T, Latias, and Latios for slightly higher damage than U-turn. Never discount the 20% freeze chance on anything but Primal Groudon, either. Alternatively, Fire Punch gives Jirachi a way to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor, both of which wall Jirachi otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 HP EVs allow Jirachi to survive Geomancy Xerneas's +2 Focus Blast after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage in order to hit it hard with Iron Head. They also give Jirachi a healthy chance to survive a +1 Earthquake from Jolly Mega Salamence in order to hit it with Ice Punch. 152 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Jirachi to bring Geomancy Xerneas into range of priority such as Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed, dealing 52-62% damage. The rest is poured into Speed, and conveniently allows Jirachi to outrun the albeit now rare Choice Scarf neutral-natured base 90 Pokemon and Deoxys-A. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Naive Deoxys-A and OHKO it with U-turn, with Jirachi being able to switch in on Psycho Boost due to its quadruple resistance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, a Jirachi on very low health can still be very useful due to its fast Healing Wish. Keeping Jirachi around no matter how much health it is on, unless paralyzed, is always a good idea. Because Jirachi baits extremely dangerous Pokemon in Ubers, U-turn should be used liberally, as it is probable that the opponent will switch in Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon. Being able to U-turn out of them and into your own check works very nicely, as they take chip damage from U-turn and Stealth Rock and are then forced out. In dire circumstances it is also feasible to flinch opposing Pokemon to death, should you have no other way of dealing with them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Jirachi should be used on offensively inclined teams to make full use of its ability to check Xerneas, Latias, and Latios, revenge kill weakened threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y, gain and keep momentum with U-turn, lure out and chip away at Primal Groudon, and provide Healing Wish support to its teammates.</p> <p>Due to the way Jirachi can U-turn out of its checks, reliable entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, Dialga, Greninja, and Klefki are all good partners for it. Extreme Killer Arceus and Rayquaza in particular work nicely alongside Jirachi, as Rayquaza has fantastic defensive synergy with it, both are able to take out opposing Geomancy Xerneas with Extreme Speed after Xerneas takes an Iron Head from Jirachi, and both also vastly appreciate a Healing Wish to restore them if they take damage or are burned. Calm Mind Primal Kyogre is another fantastic team member to consider, as it can switch into Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh via Jirachi's U-Turn and wreak havoc, and also appreciates the possibility of being brought back later in the game by Healing Wish.</p> <p>Using Xerneas alongside Jirachi, especially Geomancy Xerneas, is also recommended, as Geomancy Xerneas fits well on the sorts of teams that Choice Scarf Jirachi will find itself on, and can also switch into Yveltal much more aggressively thanks to the possibility of Healing Wish bringing it back later on. Xerneas also tramples Arceus-Dark, which can cause Jirachi problems otherwise, and can beat several other Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ghost one-on-one.</p>"
      },
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish is Jirachi's best form of recovery and can also be used to heal team members that do not have reliable recovery. Thunder Wave is used to slow down or force out Latias, Latios, Xerneas, and, to a lesser extent, Mewtwo. It also deters Mega Gengar and Mega Salamence that do not carry Refresh. Iron Head deals super effective damage to Fairy-types, and pairs nicely with paralysis. Protect ensures that Jirachi will receive its own Wish if it needs to. It can also be used to gain extra Leftovers recovery in a pinch. Serene Grace Body Slam is an alternative to Thunder Wave that deters a boosting Primal Groudon from setting up on Jirachi. It does make Jirachi bait for Mega Gengar though, and should therefore only be used with U-turn. U-turn allows Jirachi to switch out of incoming Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Arceus-Dark, and other threats, escape from Mega Gengar, keep momentum for its team. Lastly, Toxic can work alongside Iron Head in order to try to break down slower defensive Pokemon through poison damage, flinches, and chip damage from Iron Head.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in HP and Special Defense alongside a Careful nature makes Jirachi extremely sturdy on the special side, while providing large 202 HP Wishes to itself and its teammates. Leftovers allows Jirachi to passively recover HP every turn. 32 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outspeed the rare, but not unheard of, positive-natured maximum Speed Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Jirachi's resistances to bring it in. It should be used to sponge attacks from Fairy-types, Latias, and Latios, and paralyze them. Passing Wishes is also something that Jirachi does well, and can work nicely alongside U-turn in order to bring teammates in on resisted moves and restore their health. Jirachi can also deal with defensive Xerneas very nicely, outspeeding it, dealing fair damage with Iron Head, and severely irritating it with flinches, which prevent it from Resting or using Aromatherapy. It is also possible for Jirachi to beat Calm Mind Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Fairy, as it resists their STAB moves and can paralyze them, and then flinch and 3HKO them with a super effective Iron Head.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A very solid switch-in to Primal Groudon is vital when using Jirachi. Yveltal works rather nicely, as it can come in on a predicted Earthquake and Jirachi can U-turn out of defensive Primal Groudon variants into it. Solid Yveltal switch-ins are also needed. Xerneas is the best because of Jirachi's Wish passing capabilities and can take on Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, as well as potentially absorb Dark Void from Darkrai should it be running Sleep Talk. Jirachi makes up for Calm Mind Primal Kyogre's lack of recovery while also checking Latias and Latios, and can paralyze many threats that outspeed Primal Kyogre, allowing it to break the opponent's team much more effectively. Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock and can be switched into Ho-Oh and Yveltal, as well as being able to Pursuit trap Mega Gengar, which can cause Jirachi problems if it runs Shadow Ball.</p>"

  "Deoxys": {
    "overview": "<p>Deoxys is well known for being horrible in every way. Offensively, it's outclassed by Deoxys-A, and as an entry hazard setter, it's outclassed by Deoxys-S. It has base 150 Attack, Special Attack, and Speed, which isn't bad, but Deoxys doesn't hit as hard as Deoxys-A. The small increase in bulk it gets over Deoxys-A is so minuscule that it won't matter in most situations; however, it does allow Deoxys to survive Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out without investment. Investing heavily in Defense adds some surprise factor to Deoxys, letting it survive stronger attacks such as Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed. Doing so is really gimmicky, but it might be worthwhile, as Deoxys has nothing better to be doing. Its only true niche is giving you an excuse for losing. No serious team should ever have this Pokemon on it, due to it being useless and 100% outclassed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using another Pokemon is the most optimal course of action when thinking about using Deoxys. However, if you must use this Pokemon, for whatever reason, Magic Coat is usable to allow Deoxys to act as an anti-lead against entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S. Stealth Rock can replace Spikes if need be, but there are more reliable Stealth Rock setters out there. Deoxys can opt for Extreme Speed to weaken or revenge kill threats that outspeed it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce will bounce back Spikes and Taunt. Mega Sableye is also immune to Psycho Boost and Superpower, making it the best switch-in to Deoxys in the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: The threat of Shadow Sneak will force out Deoxys, allowing Giratina-O to Defog away Deoxys's Spikes on the switch. Psycho Boost does not do enough damage to Giratina-O because of its great bulk.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are nuisances to Deoxys because they are immune to Psycho Boost. If Deoxys doesn't want Pokemon like Arceus-Dark and Darkrai to set up on it, it will be forced to sacrifice itself so that it can Taunt them. Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Deoxys, making it difficult to play around.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Unexpected Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas can easily take out Deoxys as it tries to use Taunt or Spikes. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can U-turn out of Deoxys or any teammate that switches in to check it, creating momentum for the opposing team.</p>",

      "ExtremeKiller Check?": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This moveset aims to salvage as much utility as possible from Deoxys. Psycho Boost is Deoxys's strongest STAB move and allows it to chip away at threats even without Special Attack investment. Spikes is a great entry hazard that helps teammates sweep more easily. Deoxys's main job isn't to set up entry hazards, but it's always a nice option if it has nothing better to do. Taunt stops opposing threats from setting up, laying entry hazards, and spreading status. The one strange move on this set is Counter, which is used for retaliating against Extreme Killer Arceus. Deoxys survives even a +2 Extreme Speed, and Counter will OHKO Arceus. Superpower is another option over Counter, as if Arceus tries to attack Deoxys with another move or just sets up on the predicted Counter, Deoxys will fail to check Arceus. Superpower is still able to deplete more than half of Arceus's HP, which is better than nothing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The 252 HP EVs and 200 Defense EVs might seem wasted on a Pokemon that only has 50 / 50 physical bulk, but they allow Deoxys to check Extreme Killer Arceus. The 56 Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature make Deoxys faster than Darkrai so that Deoxys can cripple it with Taunt or set up Spikes before it faints. They also allow Deoxys to hit Darkrai with Superpower if it is running the move; however, when running Superpower, a Naive nature is advised as to not lower its power. Chilan Berry halves damage taken from a single Normal-type attack, allowing Deoxys to survive a boosted Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If you suspect that your opponent has Extreme Killer Arceus, keeping Deoxys healthy by waiting in the back is a good option so that it can check it. If the opponent reveals another Arceus forme, Deoxys is free to set Spikes, chip away at threats, and Taunt Pokemon that might set up. If they reveal Extreme Killer Arceus, switching in Deoxys is not a good idea because Extreme Speed will activate Chilan Berry and 2HKO Deoxys on the switch. Sacrificing a teammate and then bringing Deoxys is the safest play, but you can switch it in on a predicted Swords Dance if you want to keep the teammate alive.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Deoxys shouldn't be used on a serious team, but if you must use it, it really doesn't need any teammates to function. Anything that can get some notable OHKOs after Spikes will benefit from Deoxys. Having an actual, reliable answer to Extreme Killer Arceus is nice, too, as Deoxys will usually not be enough. Pokemon that can switch into Yveltal and Giratina-O, such as Mega Diancie and Xerneas, work well because the threat of super effective priority moves will force Deoxys out.</p>"

  "Deoxys-Attack": {
    "overview": "<p>Possessing a blistering 180 Attack and Special Attack, combined with a high base 150 Speed and one of the most powerful STAB moves in the game, Deoxys-A is no slouch in the Ubers metagame. Thanks to its expansive movepool, it is able to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier like a truck. Attacking isn't the only thing Deoxys-A can do; it has the ability to function as a great lead, which can lead to some very interesting mind games with the opponent during Team Preview, and it's also capable of putting in work against all playstyles.</p> <p>However, there are a few things holding Deoxys-A back from outright destroying the metagame. First, one would have to use an electron microscope to be able to see its defenses, meaning almost any move the opponent uses is sure to OHKO it. Second, even though its movepool is expansive, Deoxys-A cannot run everything at once, and it will miss out on something that it could have gained were it to run another move. And, thanks to Mega Evolutions that have Magic Bounce, Deoxys-A's lead role is somewhat diminished.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Because Deoxys-A is extremely frail, there is little else it can do besides the aforementioned roles. Hidden Power Fire is also helpful for dealing with Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Forretress, although it does sacrifice a little power and lowers Deoxys-A's Speed IV. Fire Punch is good for dealing more overall damage than Hidden Power Fire, but it does not achieve an OHKO on Mega Scizor and Forretress. Dark Pulse works off of Deoxys-A's higher Special Attack stat (after factoring in EVs), getting more consistent damage and a chance to make the opponent flinch, but it offers less utility than Knock Off and should not be used in conjunction with it. Magic Coat can provide some utility on the lead set, but Deoxys isn't really afraid of any moves the opponent might throw at it, and it has plenty of attacking options if it ever gets Taunted. Pursuit can also be used to trap Latios and Latias from fleeing safely, although Knock Off has a generally higher Base Power and the added effect of removing an item from the opponent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Lugia, Mewtwo and Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Metagross all resist Deoxys-A's STAB and coverage moves with the ability to KO back. They should watch out for Dark Pulse and Knock Off, though, and Metagross can also be knocked out with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Deoxys-A is very susceptible to priority attacks; Extreme Killer Arceus, Steel-type Mega Evolutions, and pretty much any other Pokemon with priority attacks can take it out with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Prankster</strong>: Klefki can be a big hindrance with Thunder Wave and Toxic. Sableye is a potent anti-lead threat, having access to both Prankster and Magic Bounce simultaneously on the turn it Mega Evolves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock, status conditions, sandstorm, and hail are all harmful to offensive Deoxys running Focus Sash, slowly chipping away at it while also breaking its Sash.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Slower threats, when equipped with a Choice Scarf, become much faster and are able to KO Deoxys-A.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Bulky Yveltal variants can take any of Deoxys-A's moves bar Ice Beam. Against offensive sets, Yveltal is able to KO with Sucker Punch. Against lead sets, it can use a combo of Toxic or Dark Pulse and Sucker Punch to land a knockout.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Although the Pokemon that commonly use Pursuit in Ubers can all be taken out with the appropriate coverage move, Mega Scizor, Tyranitar, Aegislash, and Mega Metagross can all pose a serious threat, being able to knock out Deoxys-A at no cost to them.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Not all Ghost-types are able to handle Deoxys-A, but Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Mega Sableye are all unfazed by Knock Off, tank a Psycho Boost (or, in the case of Sableye, have an immunity to it altogether), and KO back.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Equipped with a Life Orb and four offensive moves, Deoxys-A becomes the epitome of mass destruction. Its main STAB move, Psycho Boost, puts a major dent into every Pokemon that isn't a Dark-, Psychic-, or Steel-type. Superpower handles many of the Pokemon in the tier that Psycho Boost cannot, and deals considerable damage to Klefki, but causes an Attack and Defense drop as well. Low Kick can be used as an alternative to Superpower if the stat drop is worrisome, hitting many of the Pokemon in the tier with 120 Base Power. Ice Beam is used to handle many of the Flying- and Dragon-types in the tier, most notably Yveltal and Mega Salamence. Knock Off is an alternative move that hits Psychic-types hard and cripples any Pokemon that heavily relies on an item to succeed; specifically, specially defensive Giratina, Latios and Latias, and Lugia. Extreme Speed is a great priority move to finish off weakened foes, and, combined with Psycho Boost, is able to achieve some nice KOs on many threatening Pokemon. Knock Off is another option that can be used in the last slot if not already on the moveset.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>As this is an all-out attacking set, the natural item of choice is the Life Orb, boosting all of Deoxys-A's attacks and making it that much more powerful. However, if survival for more than one turn is necessary, then Focus Sash is a viable alternative. Focus Sash also enables Deoxys-A to carry out a lead role, or potentially bluff a lead set if opting to save it for later.</p> <p>In terms of EVs and nature, the recommended spread is 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Rash or Mild nature to make Deoxys-A hit as hard as possible with Psycho Boost while also being faster than base 130 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Gengar and Mewtwo. Alternatively, a Naive or Hasty nature can be used to outspeed Mega Mewtwo Y and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, as well as Speed tie at worst with opposing Deoxys-A, benchmarks that a neutral Speed nature misses out on. The choice between -Def and -SpD natures is ultimately up to the user, as neither of them provides much of a difference in a match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Deoxys-A is best used as a sweeper or late-game cleaner on offensive teams in need of a strong attacker. Send out teammates to weaken opposing threats, then bring out Deoxys-A to KO the rest with Psycho Boost or the appropriate move. Even though Deoxys-A's field time is short, it is not advisable to send it out into damaging weather, entry hazards, or when an opponent is expected to inflict a status condition, especially if holding a Focus Sash. It is also recommended to take care of its checks and counters before sending it out, or Deoxys-A will not be able to do anything useful in the battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Deoxys-A does not need much team support, as it has enough power by itself, and it can usually accomplish its task before being easily KOed. Variants without Hidden Power Fire will be at a loss when facing Pursuit Scizor, and in such an instance, having Hidden Power Fire Mega Gengar as a teammate is recommended. When running Focus Sash, a Defogger such as Latios, Latias, Giratina, or support Arceus is a good idea, but Deoxys-A is usually played as a lead in this case. Damaging weather, although quite uncommon, and status conditions severely inhibit Deoxys-A's lifespan and offensive ability. For this reason, Primal Groudon is a great teammate, removing weather on the switch and absorbing Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Pokemon with Magic Bounce, such as Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, are also helpful in bouncing back status conditions. Deoxys-A also needs to be able to battle without having to worry about its checks and counters. Therefore, Pokemon capable of handling Extreme Killer Arceus and Xerneas, such as Yveltal and Mega Scizor, respectively, are good options to consider.</p>"

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This set aims at exploiting Deoxys-A's high base 150 Speed in order to make an effective lead. The choice of entry hazard is up to the player: Stealth Rock is useful to have on any team, as it is able to damage any and every Pokemon that switches in, while Spikes, although not as universally useful as Stealth Rock, is able to deal more consistent damage to grounded Pokemon, can be set up in multiple layers, and can be used if there is already a Pokemon with Stealth Rock on the team. What sets apart Deoxys-A from most suicide leads is that, after using its high Speed to set up hazards, it can use its even higher offensive stats and STAB Psycho Boost to deal major damage to opponents. Knock Off can be used to cripple opposing Pokemon, and it serves as an anti-lead measure in certain cases. For the final moveslot, Extreme Speed allows Deoxys to get a hit on faster threats before going down, while Taunt can be used to inhibit Pokemon that rely heavily on status moves. Taunt is also useful in stopping early-game Defog attempts and setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The lead set requires as much Speed as possible, even to the point of creating a Speed tie with opposing Deoxys-A if necessary, so a Naive nature and 252 Speed EVs are optimal. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack to increase the damage output from Psycho Boost. As with all suicide leads, a Focus Sash is mandatory to ensure at least one layer of entry hazards is set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a lead on offensive and hyper offensive teams. Because Deoxys-A is always going out first, and usually staying out until it gets knocked out, there is really no need to do anything else with it. However, if it is already able to get its entry hazards set up without breaking its Focus Sash, and it could prove useful later, feel free to switch it out. This should only be done sparingly, however, and usually it's best to keep it out until it faints.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As this set is a lead that doesn't care about getting knocked out, there isn't any truly obligatory team support. However, it is always useful to have Pokemon that help prevent Deoxys-A's setup from being ruined. There are still plenty of viable Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin, so a Ghost-type such as Mega Gengar or Arceus-Ghost is helpful. Primal Groudon is also worth a mention, as its Desolate Land removes opposing weather and its typing grants it an immunity to Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave.</p>"

  "Deoxys-Defense": {
    "overview": "<p>Deoxys-D, as its forme name implies, has solid bulk, sporting 50 / 160 / 160 defenses. A nice support movepool complements these defensive stats, with access to Spikes, Recover, Knock Off, status, and other tricks. Deoxys-D's Speed is disappointing, however, as it sits around a crowded Speed tier and doesn't have room to invest in this stat. It also suffers from abysmal typing on both offense and defense; Psychic doesn't trump any relevant types, doesn't resist any relevant types, and is weak to common Dark- and Ghost-type moves. Deoxys-D also doesn't check any offensive threats in particular, which is why it's almost entirely outclassed by other defensive setters of Spikes. To make matters worse, Deoxys-D is hard countered by a few viable Pokemon. Deoxys-D is also impacted by the fact that it is afflicted by all status ailments and entry hazards, further decreasing any potential for defensive synergy. Reconsider using this Pokemon, as it has little to no justifiable niche.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave can cripple opposing setup sweepers; however, Toxic is usually much more useful because of the residual damage it causes. Taunt is an option that can break down slower defensive Pokemon while also preventing incoming Defoggers from being able to remove Spikes, although there isn't room for it. Deoxys-D can function as a setter of Stealth Rock if needed, but it's hard to fit on the same set as Spikes and isn't stackable in the same way. Counter and Mirror Coat can be used to surprise unsuspecting attackers; however, it is prediction-reliant and risks giving the foe a free setup turn. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back status ailments and entry hazards aimed at Deoxys-D, but it is prediction-reliant and hard to find room for.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users</strong>: Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie force Deoxys-D to run Skill Swap in order to have any use as a setter of Spikes. Although they can be poisoned with Toxic after a Skill Swap, the fact that Deoxys-D has to run a dedicated move for them justifies them as notable threats.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Arceus-Ghost, Mega Gengar, Giratina-O, and Aegislash can all threaten Deoxys-D with their super effective STAB attacks. Additionally, Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O can Defog away Spikes, Aegislash is immune to Toxic, and Mega Gengar can trap and remove Deoxys-D entirely.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Darkrai, Yveltal, and Arceus-Dark are threats to Deoxys-D because of their powerful super effective STAB moves, while Deoxys-D can do little to them in return.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre has powerful enough rain-boosted STAB attacks to easily break through Deoxys-D.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo variants with Taunt can break down Deoxys-D by preventing it from using Recover.</p> <p><strong>Genesect and Mega Scizor</strong>: Both Genesect and Mega Scizor are immune to Toxic, resist Ice Beam, and have a strong U-turn that can threaten Deoxys-D.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Steel</strong>: Deoxys-D has no method of breaking down Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Steel, as they are both immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Other Spikes Setters</strong>: Klefki, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress can threaten Deoxys-D with Toxic or can set Spikes alongside it while Deoxys-D can do very little to them in return.</p>",

      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes can be stacked up on switches or if the opponent is playing passively. Spikes deals residual damage to grounded foes that switch in, which can break down foes or bring them within range to be KOed by an offensive teammate. Recover is needed to keep longevity and to stall out threats in combination with Toxic. Skill Swap ensures that Spikes can be set against Pokemon with Magic Bounce such as Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, and can also mess with Pokemon that heavily rely on their ability in order to deal damage, such as Mega Salamence. Toxic is used to punish support Arceus formes, Giratina-O, Latias, and Latios that might come in to Defog away Deoxys-D's Spikes. Ice Beam hits some common Pokemon for mild damage, but is mainly used to hit Mega Salamence. Knock Off can punish most Pokemon that Toxic doesn't by removing their held item, while still impacting Latias and Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to maximize the low base HP of Deoxys-D and to make Recover more usable. 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature are used to maximize physical bulk in order to better take attacks in the physically oriented Ubers metagame. The remaining 8 EVs are slotted to slightly boost Deoxys-D's Special Defense. Use an Impish nature if using Knock Off as to lower Deoxys-A's Special Attack rather than reduce Knock Off's power. Leftovers is the preferred item, which provides passive recovery to help offset residual damage. Pressure is the only ability available for Deoxys-D and, while it is generally useless, it can burn up low-PP moves used by the foe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Toxic, Ice Beam, and Knock Off are Deoxys-D's only means of punishing switch-ins. This means using Toxic when it is obvious a Defogger is coming in, Ice Beam if you want to chip away at a Pokemon that lacks recovery, and Knock Off to remove an opposing Pokemon's item that is removable. If neither Toxic, Ice Beam, nor Knock Off are capable of punishing an impending switch-in, it is best to double switch to an appropriate check. Don't let opposing Pokemon set up on top of Deoxys-D. Giving them a setup turn in exchange for poisoning them with Toxic is usually not worth it; immediately switch to a defensive check if setup is obvious. Become aware of what Deoxys-D can wall and what it can't. Most strong physical attackers will be able to break through after setup while the most powerful of special attackers can also 2HKO it. Stallbreakers that are immune to Toxic or that can Taunt Deoxys-D before it can move will also avoid being walled. Deoxys-D doesn't have much defensive utility, but it can be used as fodder to get a teammate in for free if its function as a Spikes setter is no longer needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, and Mega Diancie can switch in from Deoxys-D when it is fleeing from a Dark-type threat. Dark-types themselves are also good partners, as they are able to break down Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O. Primal Kyogre benefits from the Spikes that Deoxys-D can set, as entry hazard damage wears down several of its common checks. Deoxys-D can also lure in Latios and Latias that come in to Defog, and can hit them with Toxic or Knock Off, making it easier for Primal Kyogre to pressure the opposing team. Primal Groudon is another partner that benefits from Spikes, while Deoxys-D can wear down some of its common checks with Toxic. Giratina-O can be a good partner when not using Ice Beam, as Deoxys-D using Skill Swap on Mega Salamence means that it has no moves to hit Giratina-O with unless it switches out.</p>"

  "Deoxys-Speed": {
    "overview": "<p>Deoxys-S has the highest base Speed of any Uber Pokemon, and its 50 / 90 / 90 bulk is respectable for such a utility Pokemon. Its access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, Taunt, Skill Swap, and Magic Coat makes it worth using, as consistently setting entry hazards is what composes its niche. In this area, Deoxys-S is a specialist, doing great at the one job it does but not offering a more dynamic list of uses. Using Deoxys-S is desirable due to it letting hyper offense teams free up Primal Groudon's moveset without needing to resort to other, sometimes more awkward, offensive Stealth Rock setters. Despite such utility, Deoxys-S offers next to no defensive synergy for offensive builds, partially due to the fact that flexibility in its moveset is restricted by Magic Bounce users. Deoxys-S also only fits on hyper offense teams, and even then it doesn't actually fit on very many builds.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A dual screens set of Taunt, Stealth Rock, Reflect, and Light Screen can be used with an EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature and Light Clay. Such a set is less consistent at ensuring Stealth Rock when compared to the standard set, but the utility of screens can make setup for teammates a bit easier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Darkrai</strong>: Darkrai can OHKO Deoxys-S with Dark Pulse if it is running Rocky Helmet. The threat of Dark Void also causes mind games in regards to whether Deoxys-S should set entry hazards, use Taunt, or use Magic Coat.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: If Taunted, Deoxys-S becomes useless, as it runs no attacking moves. This mainly applies to Pokemon with priority Taunt and those that bounce Taunt back at Deoxys-S.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce and Magic Coat</strong>: Magic Bounce and Magic Coat can bounce Deoxys-S's entry hazards and Taunt back at it.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves can potentially limit Deoxys-S to a single turn on the battlefield; common users include Arceus, Rayquaza, Giratina-O, Deoxys-A, and Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Speed Boost</strong>: Scolipede and Mega Blaziken can become faster than Deoxys-S due to the ability Speed Boost. In combination with Pin Missile, Scolipede becomes effective at anti-leading Deoxys-S, while Blaziken at +1 is faster than the standard spread.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers such as Latios, Judgment Arceus-Ghost, Primal Kyogre, mixed Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Arceus-Dark can OHKO Deoxys-S if it does not have a Focus Sash.</p>",

      "Entry Hazard Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt is necessary to prevent the opposing Pokemon from setting up or Defogging. This also forces Pokemon to attack and eliminate Deoxys-S. Deoxys-S provides an effective means of setting Stealth Rock, and this potentially frees up a teammate's moveset, usually Primal Groudon's. Skill Swap is needed to ensure entry hazards can be set against Pokemon with the ability Magic Bounce. Magic Coat is used to reflect incoming Taunt and thus gives some edge when facing opposing Deoxys-S or hyper offense teams. Spikes can be used instead of Magic Coat as a secondary entry hazard to set once Stealth Rock is in place, giving Deoxys-S something worthwhile to do until it faints.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs with 244 Defense EVs let Deoxys-S avoid being limited to a single layer of hazards by a Choice Band Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire that burns as well as prevent Deoxys-S from being OHKOed by most physical attacks. 16 Speed EVs and a Timid nature make Deoxys-S faster than maximum Speed Deoxys-A and Mega Aerodactyl. A Rocky Helmet punishes moves that make contact, most notably priority moves and Rapid Spin. In regards to Rapid Spin, this also breaks a Focus Sash held by Cloyster or Excadrill as well as Sturdy on Forretress. A Focus Sash ensures Deoxys-S survives any single attack so that it can be guaranteed a layer of Spikes, most notably powerful special attacks. A Mental Herb saves Deoxys-S once from being Taunted or from accidentally Taunting itself, but to ensure that you beat opposing Deoxys-S, Magic Coat is needed as well. Maximum Speed can be used to gain some edge when facing opposing Deoxys-S, and it is desired if not running Magic Coat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Anti-leads to Deoxys-S spotted at Team Preview may necessitate leading with another Pokemon. Even then, there are very few Pokemon that can deny this set at least Stealth Rock. Against threats that pose a great danger after setup, Taunt is used to prevent them from boosting. Threats such as Rayquaza that can set up and anti-lead Deoxys-S reasonably well are the most troublesome. Against Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, you will have to use Skill Swap before Stealth Rock can be set. Mega Diancie 2HKOes with Moonblast and Mega Sableye only 3HKOes with Foul Play, so there is sufficient time to get Stealth Rock in place. Opposing Diancie and Sableye may choose not to Mega Evolve, in which case Deoxys-S will be unable to Skill Swap Magic Bounce. In this situation, Deoxys-S can always opt to set Stealth Rock immediately, which will ensure Stealth Rock against these foes, but this may come at the cost of having it on your side as well. Spinners are sufficiently punished by Rocky Helmet, meaning entry hazards can be continually re-set. Getting entry hazards up and then switching to a Ghost-type can also work. Against opposing Deoxys-S, you have a greater advantage if your set is running maximum Speed or if you have a Mental Herb; otherwise, you may want to anti-lead with a teammate. If Deoxys-S is paralyzed, it will no longer be fast enough to Taunt Defoggers before they remove entry hazards. Against such threats, it can use Taunt and set up hazards afterwards, but Deoxys-S may not survive for that long.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Freeing up Primal Groudon's moveset is a large draw of running Deoxys-S. For this reason, Rock Polish, Swords Dance, or Double Dance Primal Groudon is a desirable teammate. Darkrai is a good partner due to how it threatens defensive teams and can lead well against some of the Pokemon Deoxys-S struggles to set up Stealth Rock on. Swords Dance Arceus formes are typically good fits for offensive builds that utilize Deoxys-S; Extreme Killer Arceus can revenge kill Darkrai and threaten Pokemon with Speed Boost, Arceus-Ghost can provide an immunity to Normal-type priority moves, and Arceus-Ground crushes Mega Diancie. A Mega Diancie of your own can lead against Darkrai and opposing Deoxys-S well and also checks several of the strong special attackers that Rocky Helmet Deoxys-S fears. Xerneas is another offensive Fairy-type that can lead well against Darkrai and Deoxys-S if it has a Choice Scarf, and it can also take full advantage of the hazard support Deoxys-S provides with a Geomancy set.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Before ORAS, Lopunny's abilities, while quite good, were never enough to compensate for its middling stats. However, its Mega Evolution grants it significantly better stats and unresisted coverage due to its new ability, Scrappy. Mega Lopunny's base 135 Speed allows it to revenge kill Pokemon such as Darkrai and pull off the fastest Healing Wish in the Ubers metagame. Mega Lopunny can also use Fake Out reliably, because Scrappy removes Ghost-types' immunity. All of this makes Lopunny a potent supporter on hyper offense teams. However, Mega Lopunny is still relatively weak, even with its respectable base 136 Attack, as it cannot hold a power-boosting item such as Life Orb.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lopunny has a fantastic support movepool; however, most moves are not very helpful to hyper offensive teams. Heal Bell is useful for most teams, but offensive teams that Lopunny fits on will not usually have multiple Pokemon simultaneously crippled by status. Moreover, any teammates that have been inflicted with status can be cured by Healing Wish. Encore is another move that can be used with Lopunny's excellent Speed; however, it does not offer that much in terms of team support. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Lugia and Primal Groudon. Drain Punch can be tempting for newer players due to its ability to heal HP, but it is far too weak to be useful. Finally, Lopunny has the option of Baton Passing Cosmic Power, Agility, and Substitute, but it has far better things to be doing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Mega Lopunny is quite weak, so it has a hard time getting past most Pokemon with high Defense. Mega Salamence, Lugia, both Giratina formes, Arceus-Ghost, defensive Yveltal, and Landorus-T can all switch into Mega Lopunny and either threaten to KO it or cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, and Klefki can all switch into Low Kick from Mega Lopunny, although Klefki needs to watch out for High Jump Kick. Xerneas does not like to take Return, either.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Most Choice Scarf users in Ubers, such as Xerneas, Genesect, and Zekrom, can deal huge amounts of damage to Mega Lopunny, if not KO it outright.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Extreme Killer Arceus can deal a lot of damage to Mega Lopunny with Extreme Speed and KO it with some prior damage, although it cannot OHKO Lopunny at full health and instead gets OHKOed in return.</p> <p><strong>Deoxys-A</strong>: While Deoxys-A cannot switch into Mega Lopunny, it can easily revenge kill Mega Lopunny with Psycho Boost.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mewtwo Y</strong>: Mega Mewtwo Y can outspeed Mega Lopunny and OHKO it with Psystrike.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return and Low Kick give Lopunny unresisted STAB moves. High Jump Kick can be used over Low Kick, as Low Kick has a low Base Power against Klefki and, to a lesser extent, Jirachi. However, even with Scrappy, the miss chance and Protect users make High Jump Kick a lesser option, as Low Kick hits most Pokemon in Ubers for maximum power anyway. Fake Out is used so Lopunny can have a free turn to Mega Evolve, and it chips setup sweepers such as Xerneas and Arceus. Healing Wish allows Lopunny to bring back a crippled teammate, which is extremely useful on the hyper offense teams that Lopunny fits into. Ice Punch can be used in the last slot over Healing Wish to hit Mega Salamence hard, but Healing Wish is more unique and useful to Mega Lopunny. Even with Ice Punch's 4x effectiveness, Mega Salamence is bulky enough to not be fazed too much by it, assuming Salamence has Intimidated Lopunny first before Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thanks to its unresisted coverage and blistering Speed, Mega Lopunny fulfills a number of roles for a hyper offense team. It can revenge kill and chip away at dangerous sweepers such as Darkrai, clean up late-game when its counters have been weakened, and pull off a fast Healing Wish to bring back a weakened teammate. Limber is the preferred ability pre-Mega Evolution due to its ability to ward off paralysis. Lopunnite is compulsory, as there is little reason to use Lopunny outside of its Mega Evolution. Maximum Speed with a Jolly nature allows Lopunny to outspeed neutral Speed Deoxys-A and base 130 Speed Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Mega Gengar, and the rest of the EVs go into Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lopunny is quite a frail Pokemon, so it is best to bring it on a free switch, which can be done through a revenge kill, a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or a double switch. Use Fake Out to chip down and weaken sweepers such as Xerneas. Lopunny is generally more useful in the end-game. Bringing Lopunny in early, when most foes are still healthy, would just mean that it would get walled easily, as it is rather weak. The only exception is when you require Lopunny to revenge kill a dangerous threat, such as Mega Gengar, Darkrai, or Arceus-Dark, or to chip down a setup sweeper. Other than this, using Lopunny is fairly simple. Switch it into a Pokemon that can't do much damage or can't cripple it, such as Blissey, and then use a strong attack or sacrifice it using Healing Wish for a more potent sweeper. Sometimes it is worth using Healing Wish just to stop a foe from using Defog or Rapid Spin.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lopunny best works on hyper offense teams. Consistent leads such as Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, Custap Berry Forretress, Cloyster, and Greninja are good teammates for Lopunny. Toxic Spikes support is especially nice to have because with Fake Out, the residual damage builds up really quickly. Forretress, Cloyster, and Greninja can all use Toxic Spikes. As for sweepers that synergize well with Lopunny, Primal Groudon is probably the best choice, as it can switch into Fairy attacks that Lopunny is weak against and set up with Rock Polish or Swords Dance. In terms of specific Mega Salamence checks to use on offensive teams, the options are relatively limited. Mixed Primal Groudon with Dragon Pulse can check Mega Salamence. Arceus-Ice and Shuca Berry Zekrom can also check it but are not that good on hyper offensive teams. Geomancy Xerneas is probably the best teammate that resists Fighting-type moves to use alongside Lopunny, with its ability to stampede through teams. Arceus-Ghost also synergizes excellently with Lopunny, because it resists Fighting-type moves while preventing Rapid Spin. Yveltal is also a good Pokemon to run alongside Lopunny, as it can take on Mega Mewtwo Y, which outspeeds and OHKOes Lopunny.</p>"

Moreover, its good 67 / 116 / 116 bulk and access to Stealth Rock make it a good support Pokemon in Ubers. It is a great Stealth Rock setter, as it is able to set it up against many common Defog users, such as Arceus-Water and Latias. With key resistances to Flying, Fairy, Dragon, and Rock and immunities to Ground moves and to Toxic, Bronzong is a great check to Xerneas and a counter to Arceus-Ground, Mega Diancie, Latios, Latias, Sand Rush Excadrill, Rayquaza, Shaymin-S, Lugia, and Arceus-Water. Finally, it is only slightly Taunt bait for a wall, as Gyro Ball allows it to 2HKO most Taunt users such as Mewtwo and Darkrai.</p> <p>However, Bronzong struggles in a couple of situations and versus a couple of Pokemon. Its typing leaves it vulnerable to common Dark- and Ghost-type moves and threats. It's also setup bait for some Pokemon, such as Refresh Mega Salamence.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bronzong is a great Stealth Rock user, being able to set it up versus numerous Pokemon in the tier, including very common Defog users such as Latias and Arceus-Water. Gyro Ball is its most powerful STAB move because of its very low Speed; it is a great way to deal a decent amount of damage to faster Pokemon such as Xerneas. Gyro Ball can also punish Darkrai switch-ins and always OHKOes Mega Diancie. Toxic is used to cripple dangerous switch-ins such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon. Toxic can also hit support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ghost and Arceus-Water, as well as Latias that come in to Defog. Protect is used to scout, for example against Choice Band Ho-Oh. It also carries added utility in its ability to stall out a poisoned Pokemon and safely recover some HP from Leftovers. Trick Room can also be used to greatly annoy offensive teams with proper team support. Finally, Skill Swap is an option if setting up Stealth Rock against Mega Sableye is a must for Bronzong's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EVs in HP and Special Defense with a Sassy nature are used to let Bronzong check Xerneas and other special attackers such as Mega Diancie, Latias, Latios, and Shaymin. Leftovers is used for passive recovery. 0 IVs in Speed with a negative nature is a must to ensure optimum power for Gyro Ball. Running 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with a Brave nature is another option; it ensures that Bronzong always survives any one hit from Xerneas and can OHKO it with Gyro Ball.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using Bronzong is quite simple. Switch it in against a Pokemon it checks or counters and set up Stealth Rock or Trick Room or spam Toxic if you predict a counter such as Ho-Oh to switch in. If you are facing Xerneas, don't forget that Bronzong lacks recovery so you need it healthy, which means you should limit the number of times Bronzong switches in. Be careful about taking a Will-O-Wisp from a support Arceus forme, such as Arceus-Rock or Arceus-Grass. In games where Bronzong is needed to check Geomancy Xerneas or repeatedly set Stealth Rock against a team with anti-hazard support, it might be advantageous for your opponent to allow their support Arceus to be inflicted with Toxic in exchange for crippling Bronzong with a burn. If you have cleric support, taking a Will-O-Wisp isn't as big of a deal. If you are using Trick Room against offense, you can set up against Mega Salamence and Extreme Killer Arceus without Shadow Claw or Shadow Force. Finally, if you are using Skill Swap, Bronzong can catch Mega Sableye on the switch and set up Stealth Rock against it. You can also use Skill Swap in niche situations such as predicting Ho-Oh switching in and taking Regenerator, taking Aerilate from Refresh Mega Salamence, and escaping Mega Gengar by taking away its Shadow Tag on the switch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bronzong should be paired with a solid Ho-Oh check such as Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Water, or Tyranitar, as well as Pokemon that check Primal Groudon, such as Latias. Using Bronzong gives your Primal Groudon more freedom in its set options. For example, you can now use an offensive Primal Groudon set with Swords Dance to break stall, as Bronzong releases it from its Stealth Rock duties. If you want to use Trick Room Bronzong, you need to pair it with Pokemon that take advantage of this condition, such Swords Dance or Eruption Primal Groudon and Dialga.</p>"

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>With its good offensive Fighting / Steel typing, above average base 112 Speed, access to Close Combat, and unparalleled power with Adaptability, Mega Lucario is a serious threat in the Uber tier. It also has access to Swords Dance, which pressures entry hazard removers and allows Mega Lucario to decimate stall teams by easily finding setup opportunities on stall staples such as Blissey, Clefable, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Lugia, and Arceus-Water without Judgment. As if Mega Lucario doesn't pose a big enough threat to stall already, it also sports a nifty immunity to Toxic and a 4x resistance to Stealth Rock, meaning that it must be dealt with directly, as merely phazing it can allow Mega Lucario to find more setup opportunities during the match. Mega Lucario is no one-trick pony, though. With access to Bullet Punch, Mega Lucario functions as a revenge killer to Geomancy Xerneas, meaning that it does have utility against balance and offensive teams, overall making it a solid offensive Pokemon across the board.</p> <p>However, although Mega Lucario has a theoretically decent defensive typing with good resistances to Dark, Ice, Normal, and Dragon, its paltry 70 / 88 / 70 bulk means that it cannot switch into any attack and that it is checked by just about anything that outspeeds it and has a decently powerful coverage move. Mega Lucario also faces heavy competition from other offensive Mega Evolutions, especially Mega Salamence, which is faster, stronger, and bulkier. Although Mega Lucario has utility against offense and balance by being able to revenge kill a +2 Xerneas, it has a difficult time finding setup opportunities against offensive and balanced teams because of the offensive pressure they apply. Balance teams are especially a trouble for Mega Lucario, as they can exert a mix of offensive and defensive pressure and are able to KO it, wall it, or cripple it with status ailments. However, none of this is enough to subdue Mega Lucario's vital spirit; Mega Lucario is the rising star of the Uber tier that has a specific niche of being a soft check to Geomancy Xerneas and a stallbreaker that is very difficult to stop when boosted.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake can be used to hit Aegislash, but Aegislash cannot do much back to Mega Lucario anyway. Crunch can be used to hit Ghost-types with perfect accuracy, but the power of Iron Tail after a Swords Dance boost wards off Ghost-types well enough. A Nasty Plot set with a Timid Nature and maximum Special Attack and Speed can be used with Focus Blast, Flash Cannon, and Vacuum Wave in order to surprise Mega Lucario's usual checks, but it loses the ability to revenge kill a +2 Xerneas, which is Mega Lucario's niche over other Mega Evolutions.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to Close Combat, and most are either bulky enough to take any of Mega Lucario's coverage moves and subsequently cripple or KO it or offensive enough to outspeed and KO it. Arceus-Ghost outspeeds Mega Lucario and either cripples it with Will-O-Wisp or 2HKOes it with Judgment; Giratina can take Mega Lucario's attacks and either cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or phaze it after it sets up Swords Dance; Mega Gengar can trap and OHKO Mega Lucario with Focus Blast, but it must be wary of a boosted Bullet Punch if it is weakened; Aegislash resists Steel and can lower Mega Lucario's Attack on contact with King's Shield, but it needs Shadow Ball to do anything back. Other Ghost-types such as Mega Sableye can switch into Close Combat, but they risk being OHKOed by +2 Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh resists both of Mega Lucario's STAB moves and threatens it back with any of its coverage moves. However, Ho-Oh is KOed by a boosted Close Combat if it has taken Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: All variants of Mewtwo outspeed Mega Lucario and can KO it with their various coverage moves; however, Mega Mewtwo Y stands a chance of being OHKOed by a +2 Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. Mega Mewtwo X is especially great against Mega Lucario, as it has a 100% accurate and super effective STAB Low Kick to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Before Mega Evolving, Mega Salamence can use Intimidate to lower Lucario's Attack and set up Dragon Dance against it. However, sending out Salamence on a turn that Mega Lucario uses Swords Dance can be risky, as +1 Iron Tail OHKOes non-Impish Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Shaymin-S, Blaziken, and Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom can all outspeed and KO Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Burns and Paralysis</strong>: Burns and paralysis cripple Lucario, cutting either its Attack or its Speed and leaving it vulnerable to revenge killing.</p>",

      "Mega Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Mega Lucario to break down stall teams by overpowering many of its checks such as Mega Sableye, Lugia, and Primal Groudon. It can also allow Mega Lucario to clean weakened offensive teams with Bullet Punch. Close Combat inflicts massive damage to anything without an immunity or resistance to it and is Mega Lucario's primary STAB move. Bullet Punch allows Mega Lucario to revenge kill a weakened Geomancy-boosted Xerneas and pick off weakened foes in general. Although it is inaccurate, Iron Tail is very potent alongside Close Combat, giving Mega Lucario an immediate way to eliminate healthy Fairy-types while rounding out coverage against Flying-types and other Pokemon that resist Fighting. If Ho-Oh is of concern to Mega Lucario's team, Stone Edge can be used over Bullet Punch or Iron Tail in order to OHKO it; however, Mega Lucario will notably have issues with Mega Sableye by forgoing Iron Tail, and it loses the little utility it has against offensive teams if the move is run over Bullet Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Mega Lucario to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Jolly nature is chosen to make full use of Mega Lucario's good base 112 Speed, letting Mega Lucario outspeed most of the tier. Justified is Mega Lucario's most useful ability before Mega Evolving, possibly allowing it to gain an Attack boost by switching into a Dark-type attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In order to do anything significant with Mega Lucario, you must get an opportunity to safely Mega Evolve it. To do so, aggressively double switch Lucario into passive Steel and Dark-types that do not threaten it and are forced to switch out. Lucario can also safely Mega Evolve by revenge killing a weakened foe with Bullet Punch. If possible, utilize Lucario's pre-Mega ability Justified to gain a free Attack boost by switching it into a weak Dark-type attack, such as Dark Arceus's Judgment or non-Life Orb Darkrai's Dark Pulse. Against stall teams, set up Swords Dance on Pokemon such as Blissey, Clefable, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Lugia, and Arceus-Water. Exercise caution when setting up on a healthy Arceus-Water, though, as it can survive a +2 Close Combat and retaliate with Judgment, which can OHKO Mega Lucario after the Special Defense drop. Lastly, when using Mega Lucario as a revenge killer to Geomancy Xerneas, be sure to achieve prior damage on Xerneas before attempting to pick it off with Bullet Punch, as it can only 2HKO a healthy Xerneas at best.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon provides Stealth Rock support and can absorb Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave aimed at Mega Lucario while also functioning as a secondary answer to Geomancy Xerneas. Wobbuffet is an outstanding partner to Mega Lucario, as it can easily trap support Arceus formes other than Arceus-Ghost and set up Safeguard to allow Lucario to Mega Evolve and set up Swords Dance without fear of a status ailment. Thunder Darkrai can eliminate Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Ghost-types, allowing Mega Lucario to have an easier time punishing the opposing team with Close Combat. Primal Kyogre is an especially good teammate because it can lure in Pokemon that Mega Lucario can set up Swords Dance on, such as Ferrothorn and Blissey. Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Ghost, Fairy, and Ground pressure Ho-Oh well alongside Mega Lucario; alternatively, support Arceus formes of the same types that run Stone Edge can lure Ho-Oh and eliminate it so that Mega Lucario can have an easier time sweeping. Paralysis spreaders such as Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon can cripple walls or Pokemon faster than Mega Lucario, making its merely above average Speed less of a problem. Any offensive Pokemon that appreciates Mega Lucario chunking at its checks can make for a good partner. Extreme Killer Arceus with Refresh applies incredible pressure to Ghost-types alongside Mega Lucario. Mega Lucario's tendency to draw in and weaken Primal Groudon and other bulky Fire-types benefits Geomancy Xerneas greatly. Healing Wish from the likes of Latias and Shaymin-S can breathe new life into Mega Lucario if it has been severely weakened or inflicted with a status ailment.</p>"

  "Dialga": {
    "overview": "<p>Dialga's typing, bulk, and power allow it to remain a threat in ORAS Ubers; it is also capable of setting and keeping up Stealth Rock with ease due to its expansive movepool, which allows Dialga to deal with the common Defog and Magic Bounce users in the tier. The newcomer Primal Groudon does hurt Dialga's viability, however, as it can also fulfill the same role of a Stealth Rock setter and, because it comes with more perks, outclasses Dialga in some areas. Dialga's Ground-type weakness hurts its viability even more in a metagame dominated by Primal Groudon, and Dialga's lack of reliable recovery means it can be very susceptible to being worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dialga has a bunch of possible other options, but they tend to run into more issues than the standard sets. Choice Specs Dialga is a possible set due to its insane power but runs into problems due to its average Speed tier and, once the set is revealed, can be played around. Thunder Wave is an alternative status move that can mess with numerous Dialga switch-ins, but it generally doesn't help Dialga's role as a Stealth Rock setter very much. Earth Power is an alternative coverage option for offensive sets that can 2HKO any Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock and also 2HKO the rare Arceus-Poison, but it doesn't do anything notable outside of that. Bulk Up with physical moves such as Iron Head and Outrage is a niche set that finds itself having trouble with Will-O-Wisp Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, and Ho-Oh, all of which are commonly seen in the metagame. Trick Room Dialga can work very well on dedicated teams due to having a great typing and coverage along with a somewhat low Speed tier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: While most Arceus formes can switch into or deal with Dialga, Arceus-Ground is the best at it, being able to switch into any move and deal serious damage back. Dialga can Toxic on the switch or possibly take a hit with Shuca Berry to try taking out a weakened Arceus-Ground.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: The specially defensive variant can switch into support Dialga with relative ease and force it out or set Stealth Rock of its own. Life Orb Dialga can 2HKO with Draco Meteor on the switch, and regular Dialga sets carry Shuca Berry, so the matchup isn't exactly straightforward. Groudon's lack of recovery can also work in Dialga's favor.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Thanks to Regenerator, Ho-Oh can switch into most of Dialga's attacks, force it out, and recover off the damage just by switching. Offensive Dialga sets can carry Thunder, which will 2HKO Ho-Oh, but it can be hard to hit Ho-Oh with the move.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Due to Primal Kyogre's new base 160 Special Defense, nearly all variants can deal with Dialga. Specially defensive Primal Kyogre can switch into Dialga with impunity and proceed to wear it down with Scald. Calm Mind variants can also switch in and boost in front of Dialga. Offensive variants of Dialga with Thunder can 2HKO Calm Mind Primal Kyogre variants but still can't 2HKO specially defensive variants without a Life Orb.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Arceus Formes</strong>: Nearly all Arceus formes can switch into Dialga at least once, and those that don't care about Toxic are even better answers. Dialga can attempt to pressure with Draco Meteor or Toxic, but if Arceus has Calm Mind + Refresh, Dialga is helpless without Roar.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Lugia, Blissey, and Heatran can take Dialga's attacks really well, and Lugia and Blissey also have reliable recovery to help with this. None of these Pokemon can actually take down Dialga very easily, however; they have to chip away slowly.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: While they don't have the easiest time switching in, Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Lucario all outspeed Dialga and OHKO with their STAB moves. Arceus-Fighting also outspeeds Dialga and will 2HKO with ease.</p>",

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock can be set up reliably and works great on offensive teams that would prefer to have an offensive Primal Groudon set. Draco Meteor from this Dialga variant will severely dent just about anything that doesn't resist it and makes it a terror to switch into. Having both Flash Cannon and Thunder means that Dialga now has excellent coverage across most of the tier, and with the Special Attack investment, the attacks will OHKO or 2HKO just about anything weak to them. Thunder allows Dialga to hit Ho-Oh, Lugia, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Water super effectively. Fire Blast is an alternative option to Thunder that can hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn that would otherwise resist the entire moveset.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The HP EVs give Dialga maximum bulk, while maximum Special Attack and a Modest nature give Dialga excellent power behind its attacks. 12 Speed EVs allow Dialga to outspeed Diancie before Mega Evolution. Shuca Berry is preferred to give Dialga the extra niche of being an offensive check to Mega Salamence and also lets it survive an attack from Primal Groudon or Arceus-Ground in a pinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Dialga's great typing to find opportunities to switch in and set up Stealth Rock while using the tremendous power behind its attacks to ward off Defog or Magic Bounce users. This set does not have as much bulk as the support set and lacks recovery, so take care to avoid unnecessary damage. Keeping this Dialga variant healthy is key for offensive teams to be able to stop Mega Salamence. It should be noted that if Dialga cannot force its way past Defog users with recovery, it is unable to stop Defog and may kill momentum after using Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Dialga set best fits on offensive teams that require a Stealth Rock setter that can also check Mega Diancie and Mega Salamence due to the Shuca Berry. Teams that are using Pokemon that can clash with Primal Groudon, such as Arceus-Ground, can use Dialga as an alternative Stealth Rock user. Checks to Primal Groudon make for great teammates, as Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence are commonly seen together, and Dialga cannot deal with both. Examples include Giratina-O, Latias, and Latios. The aforementioned Pokemon also help with Dialga's Fighting-type weakness, as they can switch into Mega Blaziken, Mega Lucario, and Mega Mewtwo X. Strong physical wallbreakers such as Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence can break past the specially bulky Pokemon that Dialga cannot do very well against, namely Ho-Oh. Mega Gengar can also potentially trap and remove possible Dialga checks.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a key niche that Dialga can provide to a team and is what this set is built around. Draco Meteor provides a great STAB attack for Dialga, OHKOing nearly everything weak to it with the exception of Latias and Giratina while also dealing great damage to neutral targets, making it very difficult to switch into when taking Dialga's possible coverage into consideration. Fire Blast hits the majority of Pokemon that resist Dragon in the tier for great damage, OHKOing Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Genesect. Flash Cannon is an alternative coverage move that can be used to take out Mega Diancie, Arceus-Rock, and Tyranitar if needed. Toxic can pressure bulky Defog Arceus formes and prevent them from removing Stealth Rock while also catching Dialga switch-ins such as Ho-Oh and Lugia. Roar can also be used in place of Toxic to phaze potential setup sweepers that may try to set up on Dialga after it has used Draco Meteor, and Roar can help to prevent it from being trapped by Shadow Tag users. Rest could also be used in the last slot, as a common way of beating Dialga is through residual damage and Rest can stop that from becoming an issue.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>244 HP EVs and maximum Special Defense with a Calm nature allow Dialga to take on the numerous special attackers of the tier, such as Mewtwo, Kyogre, and Palkia. The 12 Speed EVs are used to let Dialga outspeed maximum Speed Diancie before it Mega Evolves. Shuca Berry allows Dialga to become a great check to Mega Salamence, and it can prevent Primal Groudon from easily taking advantage of Dialga's Ground weakness. Leftovers can also be used if the passive recovery is necessary. A physically defensive spread could also be used instead to check Pokemon such as Rayquaza, Zekrom, and Mega Salamence better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dialga's typing alone can provide plenty of opportunities to switch in and set up Stealth Rock multiple times in a match. However, Dialga's lack of recovery without Leftovers means that some caution should be used when switching in repeatedly. Toxic possible Defog users such as bulky Arceus and attack with Draco Meteor to pressure them while constantly setting up Stealth Rock to keep it on the field. Be wary of possible setup sweepers after using Draco Meteor; if they can deal with being poisoned, you might find yourself in trouble. This isn't an issue if you are running Roar, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Dialga is based around supporting its teammates, and therefore it doesn't require much support of its own. Pokemon that appreciate Stealth Rock being on the field to aid in sweeping, such as Geomancy Xerneas and Extreme Killer Arceus, make for great partners. Pokemon that have good defensive synergy with Dialga, such as Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, Latios, Latias, and Lugia, also pair well with this set; Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O in particular make for great teammates due to their Ground immunity. Note that if you are using Fire Blast over Flash Cannon, Mega Diancie can completely shut this set down, so be sure to have an answer to it, with possibilities being Arceus-Ground or Primal Kyogre. Dialga generally finds its way onto teams that need a Stealth Rock setter that isn't Primal Groudon.</p>"

  "Palkia": {
    "overview": "<p>Palkia doesn't offer much defensive utility compared to other reliable Primal Kyogre switch-ins such as Primal Groudon and Latios, which makes fitting it onto a team difficult. It also struggles to contribute against highly offensive teams because it can't really switch in on any offensive Pokemon well other than Primal Kyogre. However, Palkia is still one of the best Primal Kyogre switch-ins, and it isn't afraid of Pursuit or Steel- and Dark-types nearly as much as its main competitors Latios and Latias. Additionally, in contrast to its lackluster performance against offense, Palkia is an excellent weapon against more defensive teams, as it can destroy most potential switch-ins with its power and wide coverage. If its defensive shortcomings are properly covered, Palkia is a formidable foe.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Palkia can use Lustrous Orb to boost its STAB moves without having to deal with Life Orb recoil, but it will miss out on 2HKOs against Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, Lugia, and defensive Primal Groudon, which makes Life Orb preferable. Trick Room can let Palkia turn the tables against hyper offense teams and would-be revenge killers, but it struggles to set it up effectively. Thunder Wave is a decent option to harass Pokemon such as Lugia and faster Arceus formes with Calm Mind that might otherwise be able to stall out Palkia, and it also prevents Xerneas from being able to set up on Palkia. Dragon Tail can be used to prevent setup attempts from Calm Mind and Swords Dance Arceus formes while harassing Blissey in conjunction with entry hazard support. Earth Power is a perfectly accurate attack that does more damage to Primal Groudon than Spacial Rend and hits Klefki harder than Hydro Pump but otherwise has little utility. Choice Specs gives Palkia an even bigger power boost than Life Orb but is generally not recommended because common Pokemon are immune to at least one of its STAB moves, making it easy for something like Rock Polish Primal Groudon or Geomancy Xerneas to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Arceus Formes</strong>: Arceus formes that aren't weak to Palkia's STAB attacks and are EVed to be faster than it are probably its most reliable checks. Arceus-Fairy is immune to Spacial Rend and can Recover off Hydro Pump damage until Palkia runs out of PP, and Judgment is an easy OHKO. If Arceus-Fairy has Calm Mind, it can also set up on Palkia. However, Hydro Pump will still do a lot of damage to Arceus-Fairy if it connects on the switch, and if it is slower than Palkia it will lose. Arceus-Grass is in a similar situation, though it trades the Spacial Rend immunity for a resistance to Hydro Pump, and it will take massive damage from Fire Blast if Palkia has it. Arceus-Ghost isn't weak to any of Palkia's attacks and can try to set up Calm Mind against it. Arceus-Ice and Arceus-Dark can do something similar, but they need to watch out for Focus Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Powerful Pokemon that are faster than 328 Speed can usually revenge kill Palkia with ease, even if they can't switch in too well, with Mega Salamence, Mewtwo, Mega Lucario, Swords Dance Arceus formes, Mega Diancie, and Deoxys-A being some good examples. Mega Gengar can also trap a weakened Palkia and pick it off with a STAB attack or Destiny Bond. Darkrai can also put Palkia to sleep with Dark Void and then beat it down with Dark Pulse. Pokemon with Choice Scarf such as Landorus-T and Genesect can also do the trick against a weakened Palkia. Palkia similarly doesn't enjoy taking priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Rayquaza or Arceus and Sucker Punch from Yveltal.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Palkia's decent base 100 Speed is one of its best assets, so paralyzing it can make it easy to revenge kill. Specially defensive Primal Groudon, Klefki, and defensive Jirachi can all take one hit from Palkia and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Primal Groudon is 2HKOed by Spacial Rend, and Fire Blast will destroy Klefki and Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Latias and Latios</strong>: Timid Latias and Latios can switch in on any move other than Spacial Rend and then outspeed Palkia and OHKO it with Draco Meteor. Latias is also bulky enough to survive a Spacial Rend at full HP in case the Palkia user predicts the switch.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn resists Palkia's STAB attacks and can stall it out with Leech Seed. However, Ferrothorn will be 2HKOed by either STAB attack followed by Focus Punch, so it may need to play some mindgames with Palkia to successfully beat it. It should also be noted that Ferrothorn completely fails as a check if Palkia has Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas is immune to Spacial Rend, is bulky enough to survive one Hydro Pump, and can either use Moonblast immediately to KO Palkia or set up Geomancy first. However, Xerneas cannot switch directly in on Hydro Pump, as it will be 2HKOed.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia hates Thunder and can't really switch into Palkia if it lacks Multiscale, but if Lugia is at full HP it can use Toxic and Multiscale to stall Palkia out. Thunder also isn't terribly accurate, so Lugia can fish for misses.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey completely walls Palkia if it lacks Focus Punch and can stall it out with Toxic. If Blissey has Seismic Toss, it can make use of it to keep Palkia from successfully using Focus Punch if it's healthy enough to take Palkia's other attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dialga</strong>: Dialga resists Hydro Pump and is bulky enough to take a Spacial Rend, OHKOing Palkia in return with Draco Meteor. Spacial Rend 2HKOes Dialga, though, so it needs to be very careful when it decides to come in.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable is 2HKOed by Hydro Pump but can come in on any other move and OHKO Palkia with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock and Spikes will wear down Palkia quickly in conjunction with Life Orb damage.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With decent Speed, massive Special Attack, and a wide assortment of coverage moves to back up its powerful STAB attacks, Palkia is a very effective wallbreaker. Spacial Rend is the chief STAB option for its power and reliability, easily 2HKOing Primal Groudon and most other Pokemon that don't resist it. Hydro Pump also gets STAB and complements Spacial Rend well, taking out most Fairy- and Steel-types that would try to stomach Spacial Rend in one or two hits. It is also slightly more powerful than Spacial Rend against targets neutral to both moves. Thunder allows Palkia to reliably 2HKO Primal Kyogre, even through a Calm Mind boost assuming Stealth Rock is up. Lugia and Arceus-Water are both reliably 2HKOed by Thunder as well, and the 30% chance of paralysis works as a strong deterrent against trying to stall out Palkia with recovery moves. Focus Punch allows Palkia to OHKO Blissey on the switch, which otherwise takes all of Palkia's attacks with ease. Ferrothorn also takes massive damage from Focus Punch, though it won't be OHKOed and Palkia will take significant recoil damage in return from Life Orb and Iron Barbs. If Klefki and Ferrothorn are more pressing concerns than Blissey, Fire Blast can be used instead of Focus Punch to destroy them both, though it should be noted that Klefki already takes massive damage from Hydro Pump. Fire Blast also hits the rare Arceus-Grass for heavy damage.</p> <p>Draco Meteor is also an option over Spacial Rend for a stronger Dragon-type STAB attack. It can be useful to get a guaranteed OHKO on Latias and to do more immediate damage to Primal Groudon and Dialga, but aside from that it doesn't get any KOs that Spacial Rend or Palkia's other attacks don't already manage. The drop in Special Attack after using Draco Meteor also gives sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas and Rock Polish Primal Groudon an opening to set up on Palkia, which makes the consistency of Spacial Rend more appealing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Palkia needs the power of Life Orb to guarantee 2HKOs on Pokemon such as defensive Primal Groudon with Spacial Rend. A Timid nature boosts Palkia's Speed without lowering its defenses—Focus Punch still destroys Blissey even with the drop in Attack, so running a Hasty nature isn't necessary. Palkia should always run a nature that boosts Speed, as many Latios and support Arceus formes do not run Speed-boosting natures themselves due to the relative scarcity of Pokemon in the base 100 Speed tier, giving Palkia an easier time dealing with them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Palkia is pretty easy to use. Just bring it in against Primal Kyogre—or at least some defensive Pokemon slower than it—and start launching attacks. Try to predict what your opponent will switch in, as Palkia will generally be hitting most things for a 2HKO. For example, a common scenario is Palkia going up against a team with Primal Groudon and a Fairy-type such as Klefki or Xerneas, both of which take no damage from one of Palkia's STAB attacks and massive damage from the other. In this case, predicting which of the two the opponent might be more willing to preserve can help you choose which attack to use. Predicting the switch to Blissey isn't super important when using Focus Punch because it likes to forgo attacks to run Snatch, but it is still worth trying so Palkia doesn't take an unnecessary Toxic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Palkia likes entry hazard support to help deal with walls such as Lugia, as well as switch-ins to Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks. Primal Groudon is a solid answer to Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Klefki and also provides Stealth Rock support. In return, Palkia can come in against Primal Kyogre when Desolate Land is not active. Steel-types such as Klefki, Bronzong, and Aegislash have great synergy with Palkia, tanking Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks with ease while Palkia provides a switch-in to Fire- and Water-type moves in return. Klefki and Bronzong are especially useful because they provide Spikes and Stealth Rock respectively to help Palkia secure important KOs. Pokemon such as Arceus-Rock, Dialga, Lugia, and Tyranitar can also help handle physical Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence. Deoxys-S is a solid partner for more offensive teams because it can provide both Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> <p>Trapping support can also be useful to take down specific foes Palkia may run into trouble against. Mega Gengar can eliminate Pokemon such as Arceus-Grass and Arceus-Fairy that Palkia can struggle to damage effectively. Mega Gengar can also take out Blissey if it lacks Shed Shell and Palkia doesn't want to use Focus Punch. Pursuit support from Tyranitar, Aegislash, or Mega Scizor can eliminate pesky targets such as Timid Latios, Latias, Deoxys-A, and Mega Gengar, all of which are faster than Palkia and can possibly revenge kill it. All of them appreciate Palkia's ability to switch into Primal Kyogre as well.</p>"

  "Giratina": {
    "overview": "<p>Giratina's extremely high defensive stats make it one of the bulkiest walls in the metagame. Its Ghost / Dragon typing proves useful against some common Pokemon such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Primal Groudon, though it also leaves Giratina with annoying weaknesses to Fairy- and Dark-type moves, both of which can be easily exploited. Its Ghost typing allows Giratina to be the bulkiest spinblocker around, but spinblocking rarely comes into play in a metagame filled with viable Defog users. Giratina's vulnerability to all entry hazards means that it can be worn down easily, especially when coupled with a lack of recovery. Giratina also has a small bonus of being a Pokemon viable on stall that cannot be trapped by Mega Gengar, though Mega Sableye also has this trait. Overall, Mega Sableye tends to fit on stall teams better than Giratina, but Giratina can wall many attackers that Mega Sableye is completely unable to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set is an option that can check Calm Mind Arceus formes, but many special attackers in Ubers are strong enough to overpower Giratina through super effective STAB moves. Primal Groudon, Blissey, and to some extent Clefable generally outclass Giratina's specially defensive set. Thunder Wave is another status option that annoys all of Giratina's switch-ins, but this makes Giratina extremely passive, effectively dealing no damage and posing little threat. Defog is a possibility, but the lack of reliable recovery and weakness to all entry hazards leaves Giratina with no room to Defog, and this is especially true when trying to Defog against offensive teams. Hex can be used as an offensive move, as the status ailments that Giratina can spread will boost Hex's base power to 130. This can still prove to be weak, as Giratina has a relatively low Special Attack stat and cannot afford to invest in it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Clefable, Klefki, Mega Diancie, and Arceus-Fairy are all able to switch into Giratina and threaten it with super effective STAB moves. Giratina is almost always forced out if it cannot phaze them on the switch. Xerneas and Clefable are especially good switch-ins, as they can both run cleric moves that cures all status afflictions that Giratina has inflicted. Mega Diancie is a complete counter to Giratina, as it has Magic Bounce to completely stop Giratina's moveset as well as being immune to Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Darkrai, Yveltal, and Arceus-Dark can switch into Giratina and deal huge damage to it with their STAB attacks. Giratina can burn them on the switch, but it is forced out afterwards. Refresh Arceus-Dark can switch in repeatedly and pose a serious threat.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, and Zekrom pose a huge threat if they can get a free switch into Giratina, but this can prove to be risky. Dragon Tail does decent damage to both Latios and Latias, and Zekrom takes a huge risk by switching in, as it can be burned as it comes in. Rayquaza and Mega Salamence are not as threatening, as Dragon-type STAB moves from either of them are fairly rare. Giratina-O is also a threat, as Shadow Force can 2HKO Giratina. Arceus-Dragon can also 2HKO Giratina with Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ghost</strong>: Arceus-Ghost is one of the five Arceus formes that pose a significant threat to Giratina. The Swords Dance set is one of the few physical attackers that Giratina cannot handle, while the Calm Mind set can 2HKO Giratina with Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Kyurem-W and Arceus-Ice pose a large threat to Giratina. Kyurem-W can outright OHKO Giratina with either Draco Meteor or Ice Beam, while Arceus-Ice will 2HKO with Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Any form of passive damage, from sandstorm damage to Toxic damage to entry hazard damage, will eventually wear down Giratina. Giratina's lack of reliable recovery and susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards mean that it will be easily worn down while trying to check foes if there are entry hazards on the field. Giratina has Rest and Leftovers recovery to offset this, but it can't stay at full HP reliably over the course of a match, limiting its effectiveness.</p>",

      "The Great Wall (Physically Defensive)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp allows Giratina to check Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Mewtwo X, and non-Refresh Mega Salamence. It also spreads residual damage through burns, preventing opposing Pokemon from easily taking advantage of Giratina. Toxic can be used instead, however, to punish support Arceus formes that can deal with being burned, while also catching Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh switch-ins that predict Will-O-Wisp. Roar can phaze incoming entry hazard setters and most setup sweepers that may try to accumulate enough boosts to break Giratina, such as Refresh Mega Salamence and Refresh Extreme Killer Arceus, and it can also punish overeager Geomancy Xerneas, making it waste its Power Herb. Dragon Tail is an alternative that allows Giratina to phaze a foe if Taunted and can nail incoming Latias, Latios, and other Dragon-types for good damage. Using Dragon Tail does come with the unfortunate consequence of being complete Xerneas bait, so use it with caution. Rest is Giratina's best form of recovery, and Sleep Talk can prevent a sleeping Giratina from giving free turns away if it is lucky enough.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs and maximum Defense EVs allow Giratina to wall pretty much all physical attackers besides Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O while minimizing entry hazard damage. Use a Bold nature if running Roar and use an Impish nature if running Dragon Tail. Leftovers is very useful for Giratina when it comes to walling attackers, as it has no source of reliable recovery otherwise. Pressure is infinitely more useful than Telepathy, and it can actually prove useful against other stall teams, as they can be potentially Pressure stalled out of PP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Giratina fares excellently against most physical attackers if it's at full HP and should be switched in on them without fear. Use Rest when Giratina has been worn down, especially if it has been afflicted by Toxic. Avoid Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Klefki, as they can switch into Giratina easily, while Giratina cannot do much against them. Avoid staying in for too long, as Giratina will attract many threats that it cannot deal with after it has forced out a physical attacker. If Giratina is weakened and a Pokemon is looking dangerous, such as a boosted Mega Salamence, look to phaze the foe instead of hitting it with a status move, as it may punch holes into your team or outright sweep your team if Giratina is not able to stop it. Giratina can act as a one-time switch into Primal Kyogre if at full HP, but it is not a consistent check, as Primal Kyogre will overwhelm Giratina in the long run. Giratina has an excellent matchup against teams utilizing the Tyranitar and Excadrill combination, as Giratina can completely stop Excadrill.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Giratina can only viably fit stall teams, as balanced and offensive teams cannot afford the momentum loss that Giratina brings after it comes in. Answers to Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Klefki are essential as Giratina cannot do anything other than phaze them, with the best answer that can fit stall being Primal Groudon. Clefable can be a great partner, as it can check most Dark-types barring Sludge Bomb Darkrai, while also checking Calm Mind Arceus formes that might be able to break through Giratina. Blissey makes for a great partner, as it can handle most special attackers that Giratina cannot, while Giratina easily handles the physical attackers that try to take advantage of Blissey, such as Mega Lucario or Primal Groudon. Blissey can also pass large Wishes to Giratina thanks to its huge HP stat. Tyranitar can provide an answer to Dark-types if running Low Kick and can also check Arceus-Ghost. Entry hazard setters are great to have, as Giratina can force many switches, dealing residual damage in the process. Using Primal Groudon as the Stealth Rock setter gives Giratina more breathing room when checking Ho-Oh. Using a Spikes setter such as Ferrothorn can also pressure switch-ins, allowing the team to slowly win the war of attrition.</p>"

  "Darkrai": {
    "overview": "<p>Darkrai continues its reign as a potent offensive threat in the Ubers tier, having access to the formidable Dark Void and Nasty Plot. Being capable of sleeping a target with reasonable consistency makes checking Darkrai a challenge, often forcing the opponent to fodder something to sleep. Darkrai is rather unique as an offensive threat because it has the potential to circumvent nearly any check with an appropriate coverage or utility move, making Darkrai particularly dangerous for defensive teams. Dark Void also allows Darkrai to lead reasonably well, limiting faster foes to a single turn and preventing slower leads from being able to move at all initially. Its fantastic Speed tier of base 125 is slightly higher than that of Arceus and higher than that of a majority of the Ubers tier, while a solid base 135 Special Attack gives Darkrai enough power to make use of this Speed. Its unique combination of stats, movepool, and typing gives Darkrai everything it needs to annihilate common threats such as Arceus-Ghost, Latias, Latios, Lugia, and Giratina-O. Darkrai is also fairly easy to fit onto an offensive team, as a great amount of pressure can be placed on the opponent due to the combination of Dark Void and Nasty Plot. Its signature ability Bad Dreams is quite handy, dealing passive damage to sleeping targets and breaking Focus Sashes and Multiscale. Unfortunately, Darkrai is dependent on a Life Orb to deal the amount of damage it needs and thus can only attack so many times. Yveltal also competes with Darkrai to an extent; however, Darkrai has the unique advantages of Dark Void, Nasty Plot, and a superior Speed stat. Due to its fragility, Darkrai is hampered by common methods of revenge killing such as priority moves and Choice Scarf users. While Dark Void is accurate enough to be consistent, it's still not perfect and is notorious for missing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set that utilizes Leftovers and Substitute is a possibility, as Darkrai can set Substitutes rather well thanks to how it forces switches; however, such a set is noticeably weak and mono-Dark coverage is fairly bad. Focus Blast can hit Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Arceus-Dark, Dialga, Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Mega Diancie. Will-O-Wisp can be used to hit Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Zekrom as they switch in predicting Dark Void, and it can also neuter Swords Dance Arceus that might attempt to set up. Thunder Wave can cripple Choice Scarf Xerneas switch-ins, along with other Choice Scarf users that are not Zekrom and Mega Mewtwo Y. Hidden Power Steel is a niche coverage move that allows Darkrai to OHKO Mega Diancie, but otherwise the move is a poor choice. Ice Beam is a very niche option that can OHKO any Mega Salamence that attempts to set up, but the move has little other use. Sucker Punch allows Darkrai to get a surprise KO on Pokemon such as Mega Gengar and Mewtwo attempting to revenge kill it, but it useless besides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Although Darkrai commonly runs Sludge Bomb, several Fairy-types prove to be effective checks. Mega Diancie can bounce Dark Void back at Darkrai, resists its STAB attack, and can OHKO it with Moonblast. Choice Scarf Xerneas can directly switch into Dark Void or Dark Pulse and make use of Sleep Talk, while bulkier Xerneas sets with Sleep Talk can attempt to pull off a Moonblast. Arceus-Fairy has enough bulk to tank Darkrai's boosted Sludge Bombs and can OHKO with Judgment. Klefki resists Dark Pulse and is immune to Sludge Bomb, while it can cripple Darkrai with Thunder Wave or hit hard with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Talk</strong>: Users of Sleep Talk can absorb Dark Void and retaliate with an attack. Choice Band Ho-Oh and defensive Kyogre both run Sleep Talk, are specially bulky, and have powerful attacks. Choice Scarf users also sometimes carry the move so they can switch directly into Dark Void and outspeed and KO Darkrai.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey is one of the few defensive Pokemon that can stall out most variants of Darkrai with Toxic and Life Orb recoil due to its excellent special bulk. Its ability Natural Cure also makes it a decent sleep absorber.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority moves such as Extreme Speed, Fake Out, and Bullet Punch can be used to revenge kill Darkrai. Arceus and Rayquaza are the most common users of Extreme Speed, and while neither can OHKO Darkrai unboosted, they can still bring an end to Darkrai. Fake Out is most commonly used by Mega Kangaskhan, while Bullet Punch is used by Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Xerneas, Genesect, Jirachi, Kyogre, Zekrom, and Landorus-T are all faster than Darkrai while holding a Choice Scarf, making them potential revenge killers.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo is one of the few unboosted Pokemon that is capable of outspeeding Darkrai. Mega Mewtwo X can revenge kill Darkrai with its powerful STAB Fighting-type attacks, but it usually cannot afford to switch directly into Dark Void. Mega Mewtwo Y is immune to Dark Void but fears being hit with Dark Pulse when coming in, although it is faster than Darkrai and capable of OHKOing it with Focus Blast. Non-Mega Mewtwo can also revenge kill Darkrai if running Focus Blast, but it cannot switch in under most circumstances.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Tyranitar are bulky enough to comfortably tank Sludge Bomb and resist Darkrai's STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Paralysis cripples Darkrai, allowing a significantly wider margin of Pokemon to take advantage of its fragility.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Void is Darkrai's signature move, allowing for the incapacitation of one opposing Pokemon. This aids in Darkrai's ability to lead, set up Nasty Plot, and justify its use by forcing the opponent to fodder something. Dark Pulse is Darkrai's best STAB attack and has a 20% chance to cause the foe to flinch. Nasty Plot is easy to set up thanks to the switches that Dark Void causes, and it allows Darkrai to put on additional offensive pressure. Thunder 2HKOes common checks to Darkrai such as Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Xerneas, and it can OHKO Mega Diancie as well as Yveltal if Stealth Rock is up. Thunder also deals fair damage to Klefki; however, Dark Void and Taunt can also be used to stop incoming Klefki. Sludge Bomb can be used to OHKO Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy after a Nasty Plot boost. Taunt is also an option, which prevents the use of Sleep Talk and Defog while stopping several defensive Darkrai switch-ins such as Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Darkrai to outspeed Arceus formes and below. This is very important because one of Darkrai's greatest assets to an offensive team is its ability to pressure common Defoggers. The maximum Speed investment is also optimal for Darkrai versus Darkrai matchups, which aren't particularly common but still relevant enough to mention. 252 Special Attack EVs are invested in order to boost Darkrai's Special Attack so that Darkrai can sweep with Nasty Plot or intermediately wallbreak opposing Pokemon. The remaining 4 EVs are slotted into Defense as to not give Genesect an Attack boost with Download. A Life Orb is used to further boost the power of Darkrai's moves at the cost of some HP, which is needed because Darkrai is not nearly as much of an offensive threat without the 1.3x power boost.  A Focus Sash is also an option to allow Darkrai to survive a move that would potentially knock it out, giving it an extra turn; however, entry hazards will render this item useless and the drop in power is significant.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Darkrai leads well against a variety of threats, but it is best not to lead with it if the opponent has a Genesect or Diancie, which will force Darkrai out immediately. Due to Sleep Clause, Darkrai can only place one target to sleep at a time, so choose well; this can mean not opting to use Dark Void when it is clear that your opponent is going to send something in that is different from what you want to sleep. Darkrai has a very finite existence due to a lack of recovery and Life Orb recoil, so never keep it in longer than is needed. Furthermore, the simple act of keeping Darkrai alive means that your opponent will often not bother to try awakening the Pokemon that was slept. This can mean that sacrificing Darkrai is less advantageous than sacrificing another Pokemon in certain scenarios, because it can ensure that the slept Pokemon stays out of commission. Darkrai can prevent the use of Defog if it maintains a presence after entry hazards have been set due to its ability to outspeed all common Defoggers and hit them with Dark Void or Taunt. Darkrai also has a good matchup against a variety of common Defoggers, such as Arceus-Ghost, Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O, furthering Darkrai's ability to prevent a Defog. Nasty Plot is easy to set up thanks to Dark Void, but there is no point in setting up when the opponent has a healthy check to Darkrai; it is better to attack or double switch to an appropriate counter. Although Darkrai can beat a standard Geomancy or Life Orb Xerneas that switches into Dark Void, you must be wary of Choice Scarf Xerneas with Sleep Talk, which can potentially net a surprise KO on Darkrai.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Darkrai is generally an independent Pokemon that doesn't necessarily require any specific support; however, there are a variety of teammate options that pair well with it and contribute to offensive synergy. Primal Groudon is able to smash a majority of the Pokemon that can check Darkrai, including Choice Scarf Xerneas, Mega Diancie, Genesect, Ho-Oh, Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Zekrom, and Choice Scarf Kyogre. Extreme Killer Arceus is also a great partner that benefits from Darkrai's ability to cut through Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Lugia. With Darkrai's ability to threaten Defoggers and force switches, setters of entry hazards, especially Spikes, make for good teammates that help Darkrai abuse its attributes to the fullest. Such teammates can either be suicide entry hazard leads or offensive entry hazard setters. However, virtually all offensive Spikes setters are suicide leads. Kyogre can be used to take advantage of Darkrai's ability to threaten Latios, Latias, Giratina-O, and Primal Groudon, placing additional pressure on its checks. Offensive Xerneas benefits from Darkrai's ability to check Lugia and can potentially gain a setup opportunity from Dark Void. The few Pokemon that are able to check Mewtwo, such as Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost, are threatened by Darkrai, making it a powerful teammate. Zekrom can blast through Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre, two Pokemon that can be troublesome for Darkrai to impact. Lastly, offensive Steel-types such as Genesect and Choice Scarf Jirachi can U-turn into Darkrai when they draw out Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ghost, and Giratina-O.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Shaymin-S is known for its infamous 60% flinch chance with Air Slash thanks to Serene Grace. Beyond this, however, Shaymin-S has a very high Speed stat that allows Choice Scarf variants to revenge kill many fast threats, such as Mega Salamence at +1. Shaymin-S can provide support for its teammates through Healing Wish and Aromatherapy while breaking down walls with Seed Flare and its high chance to harshly lower the target's Special Defense. Shaymin-S's typing is somewhat of a mixed bag, granting Shaymin-S an immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Ground-type moves but also a weakness to Stealth Rock that wears down Shaymin-S quickly in addition to Life Orb recoil. Additionally, Shaymin-S's frailty makes it susceptible to priority, and Shaymin-S finds few opportunities to switch into attacks, offering minimal defensive utility outside of its Ground immunity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire is a usable coverage move to hit Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Dazzling Gleam can hit Dark- and Dragon-types for super effective damage, but it tends to be less useful than Shaymin-S's other coverage moves. Grass Whistle can put a Pokemon on the opposing team to sleep; however, it is unreliable in regards to accuracy. Sweet Kiss can confuse a foe; this synergizes well with Air Slash to prevent foes from moving.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh switches into most of Shaymin-S's attacks with relative ease thanks to a high base Special Defense and a 4x resistance to Seed Flare, and it can then proceed to OHKO Shaymin-S with Brave Bird or Sacred Fire. Ho-Oh must be wary of Hidden Power Rock from Life Orb Shaymin-S, however, as it cannot switch into Hidden Power Rock and will be OHKOed by it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types check Shaymin-S by virtue of their typing, which grants them resistances to both of Shaymin-S's STAB moves. Klefki can cripple Shaymin-S with Thunder Wave and set up Spikes. Dialga can hit Shaymin-S with a powerful Draco Meteor or Fire Blast while being able to phaze SubSeed variants with Roar. Skarmory only fears Hidden Power Fire and can heal with Roost, set up Spikes, and phaze Shaymin-S with Whirlwind. Aegislash takes most of Shaymin-S's attacks with ease and can hit it with a powerful Gyro Ball. Ferrothorn only fears Hidden Power Fire and can set up entry hazards or hit Shaymin-S with Gyro Ball. Mega Scizor can switch in and hit Shaymin-S with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can take most of Shaymin-S's attacks decently well, outspeed it, and OHKO it with Sludge Wave. However, Shaymin-S can switch out or hit Mega Gengar with Earth Power if Gengar has not Mega Evolved yet.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users can bypass Shaymin-S's high Speed stat and hit it hard before it can act, as Shaymin-S's defenses are relatively low. Extreme Killer Arceus can hit Shaymin-S with Extreme Speed, with the Jolly Life Orb Arceus variant dealing up to 70% without a boost. Mega Scizor can switch in relatively easily, only fearing Hidden Power Fire, and can proceed to hit Shaymin-S with Bullet Punch. Rayquaza also threatens Shaymin-S with a powerful Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia can switch into most of Shaymin-S's attacks thanks to Multiscale alongside great bulk and typing. Lugia can then hit Shaymin-S with a 4x super effective Ice Beam or phaze SubSeed Shaymin-S with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Although it cannot switch in easily, Mewtwo can switch in and revenge kill Shaymin-S with a 4x super effective Ice Beam or Ice Punch. However, it will be outsped and can be 2HKOed by Choice Scarf Shaymin-S.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Speed is one of Shaymin-S's most important attributes, and a crippling paralysis will leave it unable to fulfill its role as a fast, strong attacker that can break down walls and revenge KO opposing threats.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic will wear Shaymin-S down, most notably affecting the SubSeed variant which needs to stay in for extended periods of time to be effective. Toxic will also deal passive damage to the Life Orb and Choice Scarf Shaymin-S variants, which can wear it down quickly in addition to Stealth Rock damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is Shaymin-S's best Flying-type STAB move, and it has a nice 60% chance to cause the target to flinch thanks to Serene Grace. Seed Flare is able to force switches and punch holes in teams with its high chance of harshly lowering the target's Special Defense. Hidden Power Rock can be used to OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage; Hidden Power Ice can be used instead to hit Mega Salamence. Healing Wish gives Shaymin-S important utility by being able to heal one of its teammates when Shaymin-S is no longer needed late-game. Alternately, Earth Power can be used to hit Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb provides Shaymin-S with additional power, allowing it to function as a strong wallbreaker. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Shaymin-S to outspeed everything up to Darkrai while Speed tying with other Shaymin-S. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Shaymin-S's power to help with wallbreaking. 4 Defense EVs give Genesect a Special Attack boost while keeping an odd HP value so that Shaymin-S takes less residual damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shaymin-S is relatively frail, so directly switching it into attacks is not ideal; rather, use a free switch or immunity to get it in safely against something that it threatens to KO. After switching into something that is forced out, Shaymin-S can break down teams quickly by using Seed Flare and hoping to get a Special Defense drop on the incoming foe to force it out again. However, it is not advisable to always try to KO a foe with Air Slash flinches and Seed Flare, and if the foe cannot be KOed without numerous flinches and threatens to KO Shaymin-S in return, it is probably better to switch out. Try to limit the damage that Shaymin-S takes from foes, because damage from Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil alone adds up quickly. Healing Wish should be used when Shaymin-S is no longer necessary and a weakened teammate can be put in a good position to sweep or is necessary to prevent an opposing sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support weakens Shaymin-S's common switch-ins, with Stealth Rock getting important damage on Lugia and Ho-Oh and Spikes wearing down grounded Steel-types; Toxic Spikes also weakens foes and synergizes well with Air Slash's ability to cause foes to flinch. U-turn and Volt Switch from Genesect, Scizor, Yveltal, and Zekrom can bring Shaymin-S in for free. Ho-Oh switch-ins, such as Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Water, Mega Diancie, Mega Salamence, and Lugia, are important partners for Shaymin-S, because they can check a common switch-in to Shaymin-S. Fire-types, such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon, make for good teammates, as they switch into and punish the Steel-types that check Shaymin-S. Rapid Spin from Excadrill and Forretress can clear Stealth Rock without removing important entry hazards from the opponent's side. Finally, Tyranitar and Aegislash make for good partners because they can trap Mega Gengar with Pursuit.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is a fairly spammable Flying-type STAB move with a useful high flinch chance that works well with Shaymin-S's nearly unmatched Speed thanks to Choice Scarf. Seed Flare is Shaymin-S's strongest attack and can break through and force out walls with Special Defense drops. Hidden Power Ice allows Shaymin-S to revenge kill +1 Mega Salamence. Healing Wish allows Shaymin-S to revive a teammate late-game, providing support that can set up a sweep or heal a weakened check to an opposing threat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf, 252 Speed EVs, and a Timid nature allow Shaymin-S to outspeed the majority of the Ubers metagame, including most common other Choice Scarf users; they also allow Shaymin-S to outspeed Jolly Mega Salamence after a Dragon Dance. 4 Defense EVs give Genesect the Special Attack boost while keeping an odd HP value so that Shaymin-S can take an extra round of Stealth Rock damage. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Shaymin-S's power, which is otherwise mediocre. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S primarily functions by using unmatched Speed to revenge kill threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is not advisable to mindlessly use Air Slash; instead, try to anticipate switches and hit switch-ins with the appropriate move. If Shaymin-S is needed to revenge kill a potential threat later on, try to preserve its HP by not switching too aggressively with it. In general, switch Shaymin-S out if a foe threatens it with priority. Shaymin-S can function as an anti-lead for suicide leads, such as Deoxys-S, and prevent them from setting up entry hazards with a lucky flinch; however, this strategy is unreliable and will not work consistently. Healing Wish can be used to set up or stop a sweep late-game if Shaymin-S is no longer needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can set up entry hazards are important partners for Shaymin-S, as entry hazards wear down its common checks. Primal Groudon and Dialga are good Stealth Rock setters, while Klefki, Greninja, Scolipede, and Forretress can set Spikes effectively; the latter three are also able to set Toxic Spikes. Excadrill and Forretress are good Rapid Spin users that can remove Stealth Rock from Shaymin-S's side without removing entry hazards from the opponent's side. Focus Blast Mega Gengar deals with Steel- and Rock-types, which resist Air Slash, and checks Extreme Killer Arceus to an extent. Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Aegislash make for good partners, as they can beat Mega Gengar, which otherwise threatens Shaymin-S. Ho-Oh is also very threatening to Shaymin-S, so Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Water, Mega Diancie, Mega Salamence, and Lugia make for good teammates, as they check Ho-Oh. Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon are good teammates as well, as they can switch into and punish Steel-types.</p>"

      "SubSeed": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute, which can be set up on Pokemon that Shaymin-S forces out, blocks status and sponges hits to gain free turns. Leech Seed heals Shaymin-S while wearing down foes; it works well with Substitute to frustrate and break down slower teams that lack priority. Air Slash is the Flying-type STAB move of choice, as the high flinch chance helps Shaymin-S keep its Substitutes intact while gaining extra rounds of recovery from Leech Seed and Leftovers. Seed Flare forces switches and further helps to break down bulky teams with Special Defense drops. Alternately, Aromatherapy can be used to provide cleric support for teammates.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>SubSeed Shaymin-S functions as a stallbreaker that continually forces switches and weakens stall teams from behind a Substitute. 44 HP EVs give Shaymin-S an HP value that is divisible by 16 so that it gains slightly more recovery from Leftovers. 252 Speed EVs allow Shaymin-S to outspeed most foes up to Darkrai while at worst Speed tying with other Shaymin-S. The remaining 212 EVs are invested into Special Attack to maximize damage output from Air Slash and Seed Flare. Leftovers adds to the passive recovery that Shaymin-S gets from Leech Seed and allows it to stay healthy in spite of frequently using Substitute.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Substitute against things that do not threaten Shaymin-S; it can also be used repeatedly in hopes of a miss against foes that can only hit Shaymin-S with inaccurate moves such as Stone Edge. Try to keep a Substitute up as often as possible, as it is important for breaking down stall teams. Be careful with PP, because Leech Seed and Substitute will be used frequently and can run out quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Aegislash can remove Mega Gengar, which is threatening to Shaymin-S. Entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes and Spikes, support Shaymin-S well, as passive damage from Toxic Spikes stacks with Leech Seed and synergizes well with Air Slash, while Spikes punishes the switches that Shaymin-S tends to cause. Rapid Spin support removes entry hazards from Shaymin-S's side while keeping them on the opposing side. Genesect, Mega Scizor, Yveltal, and Zekrom can use U-turn and Volt Switch to provide Shaymin-S with free switch opportunities. Ho-Oh switch-ins, such as Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Rock, Mega Diancie, Mega Salamence, and Lugia, make for good partners, as do Fire-types, such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon, that switch into Steel-types.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill has a rather distinct niche in the Ubers metagame thanks to its ability Mold Breaker, which enables it to set up Stealth Rock against Magic Bounce users, something that no other suicide lead can guarantee. This role is aided by Excadrill's movepool, which gives it access to moves such as Rapid Spin to reliably beat opposing suicide leads and Toxic to discourage Defog. Mold Breaker also allows Excadrill to hit Pokemon with the ability Levitate and inflict Toxic on Magic Bounce users, which makes Mega Sableye significantly easier to handle. Excadrill can also function decently as a sand sweeper—the only viable one in the metagame— that can be deadly when played well against offensive teams, thanks to its respectable power, good Speed, and useful typing, offering it resistances to Extreme Speed and Moonblast, even though its bulk is rather poor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Head is sort of an option on the lead set if you really need the flinch chance, and there is a very small amount of flexibility on the sand sweeper set with options like Substitute, but Excadrill mostly prefers the recommended moves. Choice Band is an option on the sand sweeper set; however, being locked into either Earthquake or Iron Head is not good in Ubers, where Pokemon like Mega Salamence and Primal Groudon are too dangerous to justify giving free turns to. Choice Scarf is also bad on Excadrill for many of the same reasons and without the additional power from Choice Band, and unlike other Choice Scarf users, Excadrill cannot switch into Darkrai.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Defensive Primal Kyogre sets can take most hits Excadrill can dish out, and Primordial Sea nullifies sand. Primal Kyogre is, however, 2HKOed by Adamant Life Orb Excadrill after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Rayquaza</strong>: Rayquaza's Air Lock ability shuts down sand, but if Rayquaza is running an Adamant nature, it needs to be careful of Jolly Excadrill, which can do significant damage to it with Rock Slide and Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Lugia and Skarmory can easily tank Excadrill's hits and either wear it down through Life Orb recoil or phaze it as it tries to set up a Swords Dance. Lugia can also chip away at Excadrill with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T</strong>: Intimidate, respectable physical bulk, and its decent typing mean that Landorus-T can take on Excadrill one-on-one and win fairly comfortably. It struggles with Air Balloon and Swords Dance sets but is otherwise solid against Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes</strong>: Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon avoid the 2HKO from Earthquake and win one-on-one against offensive Excadrill, and they can Defog away the hazards set by lead Excadrill. Toxic from lead Excadrill can cripple them, however.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Yveltal</strong>: With maximum investment into physical bulk, Yveltal can take any hit with ease and do significant damage back with Foul Play, comfortably OHKOing Adamant Excadrill after Stealth Rock damage and putting Jolly Excadrill in range of fainting to either Life Orb recoil or Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: Arceus-Ground finds a lot of room to set up on Excadrill, easily surviving an Earthquake and recovering off the damage, potentially allowing Arceus-Ground to set up a Swords Dance or striking back with a powerful Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Levitate and incredible bulk mean that Giratina-O can tank Excadrill's hits with ease, either crippling it with Will-O-Wisp or dealing hefty damage back with one of its many offensive options. Giratina-O can also carry Defog to remove the hazards set by lead Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan outspeeds the lead Excadrill set and can easily OHKO it, and it can chip away at Excadrill with the combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch, doing a minimum of 70% to the offensive Excadrill setwhile also whittling away sand turns.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The combination of Stealth Rock and Mold Breaker is the entire reason to use this Excadrill set, as it will always manage to set up the entry hazard even against teams with a Magic Bounce user, something no other setter can boast. The chip damage from hazards makes life significantly easier for all sorts of offensive Pokemon, and the guarantee of setting them is very appealing. Toxic helps with breaking down stall teams and also provides a way of discouraging Defog, as it threatens the longevity of common Defog users such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon that are often required to check other Pokemon later in the game. Rapid Spin is used to allow Excadrill to beat most other hyper offense leads, preventing hazards from being set against it fairly reliably. Earthquake is the attacking move of choice for this set, as it enables Excadrill to better check Klefkiand 2HKOes most Primal Groudon. Rock Tomb is another option that 2HKOes Ho-Oh and prevents Excadrill from being setup fodder for Mega Salamence.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to set up entry hazards on the two common Magic Guard users, Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, without them being reflected back. It has additional utility in ignoring the Levitate ability of Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O, making them less capable of clearing the hazards Excadrill sets. Focus Sash is the item of choice because it means Excadrill can reliably set Stealth Rock against hyper offensive builds without being OHKOed by any of the many Pokemon that can do so. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Excadrill to outspeed most support Arceus formes, meaning that they cannot Defog away the Stealth Rock that Excadrill sets. It also has the added benefit of letting Excadrill outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 90s.The remaining EVs are used to boost Excadrill's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>For the most part, this Excadrill set should be used as a suicide lead and should only be preserved sparingly, as its usefulness is relatively low after the early-game. An exception to this is against teams with Klefki, as Excadrill can completely counter Klefki so that Pokemon vulnerable to Klefki will not struggle so much with it. Even against Klefki teams, however, Excadrill is likely to be the least useful Pokemon after it has successfully set up Stealth Rockand should only be preserved when there is no large potential cost to preserving it. Against teams with Darkrai and an opposing suicide lead that Excadrill beats, Excadrill can be used as the lead. However, if Darkrai is the opposing lead of choice, switch out to your Darkrai counter immediately. If Darkrai is on a team without an obvious suicide lead, chances are that Darkrai will be the opponent's lead, so leading with Excadrill against those teams is rather pointless. If they do not lead with Darkrai, Excadrill can probably be switched in on their entry hazard setter and either remove the Stealth Rock set or set up Stealth Rock itself on a possible Darkrai switch, depending on which is more important in that particular game. Mega Kangaskhan is another potential lead matchup that Excadrill does not appreciate. Against Mega Kangaskhan teams, it is smarter to lead with something that can handle Mega Kangaskhan instead of with Excadrilland then to try to get Excadrill in during the early-gameto set and potentially remove hazards as quickly as possible. Teams with spinblockers can be an issue for Excadrill, but Toxic dissuades many spinblockers from switching in, and most spinblockers find it difficult to handle common partners to Excadrill such as Darkrai and Yveltal. Toxic should be used as often as possible against stall teams to waste cleric PP and discourage the removal of the hazards Excadrill has set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Excadrill set is particularly good on hyper offense, so good partners are Pokemon that fit well on that playstyle. Xerneas and Darkrai, for example, appreciate the guaranteed Stealth Rock that Excadrill provides and can exert significant pressure to prevent Defog. One of the most important teammates for Excadrill is something that can deal with Darkrai, which completely shuts down lead Excadrill. Good options for this role are Ho-Oh and Choice Scarf Xerneas. Other good team options include Pokemon that appreciate the hazard removal that Excadrill provides, with Yveltal, Shaymin-S and Rayquaza being some examples that appreciate the support because it vastly increases their longevity. Excadrill is also a useful partner for Pokemon that dislike facing Klefki, as Excadrill counters Klefki very effectively, although it will not always have the opportunity to do this after doing its job in the early-game. Having a team member like Zekrom or Mega Tyranitar is highly recommended to reinforce your team against Mega Salamence, which can set up on Excadrill very easily, especially with Refresh. This Excadrill set also appreciates the use of a Ghost-type, both as a spinblocker and as an answer to Mega Kangaskhan, which can counter lead Excadrill relatively easily. Arceus-Ghost and Mega Gengar in particular fit well here, with Arceus handling Mega Kangaskhan significantly better than Mega Gengar as well as being an Extreme Killer check and a Swords Dance sweeper. However, Mega Gengar matches up very well against stall and some common forms of balance, and it can trap potential Defoggers for Excadrill.</p>"

      "Sand Rush Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake hits Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Klefki super effectively. It is also the strongest move Excadrill can use to hit neutral targets such as Primal Kyogre. Iron Head enables Excadrill to hit Fairy-types like Xerneas for super effective damage and provides useful coverage in hitting Pokemon immune to Earthquake, such as Latios and Giratina-O. Iron Head is also what enables Excadrill to check Geomancy Xerneas in sand, and it has a very nice 30% flinch chance, which can be crucial in some situations. Rapid Spin enables Excadrill to completely shut down Klefki by removing the Spikes it attempts to set up. Swords Dance boosts Excadrill's Attack and allows it to break down most Pokemon that do not outspeed it. However, it is tricky to set up effectively in sand, as Excadrill will only have three turns left to sweep before the sand runs out, and it cannot set up with Swords Dance on much. Alternatively, Rock Slide hits both Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence for good damage, OHKOing the former and discouraging setup from the latter. It hits Flying-type Pokemon such as Lugia and Yveltal slightly harder than Iron Head as well.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sand Rush doubles Excadrill's Speed in sand, making it a nightmare for offensive teams. This also enables Excadrill to check Xerneas, which it outspeeds even after a Geomancy and does a large amount of damage to with Iron Head. Jolly is the nature of choice so that Excadrill outspeeds maximum Speed neutral-natured base 90s, most notably Ho-Oh, and most common support Arceus formes, which can be crucial in allowing Excadrill to KO them when they are weakened. An Adamant nature can be used for the extra power, with Adamant Excadrill boasting the ability to 2HKO Primal Kyogre without Stealth Rock most of the time, but Jolly is generally preferred. Life Orb is the preferred item to increase Excadrill's power so that it can wallbreak more effectively, but Air Balloon is an option for Excadrill to minimize both hazard damage from Spikes and recoil damage. Air Balloon is better with Swords Dance Excadrill sets, which do not mind the lack of the immediate power of the Life Orb set as much. It also allows Excadrill to better check Klefki, as it will not wear itself down with Life Orb recoil as often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Excadrill set is intended to be a late-game sweeper against offensive teams, as Pokemon on them frequently lack the bulk necessary to tank Excadrill's hits and will not be able to outpace it in the sand. It also can be used as an additional way to check opposing Arceus, thanks to its typing resisting Arceus's STAB moves and it being faster than Arceus in sand, as well as most fast but frail attackers such as Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Geomancy Xerneas. Against balanced teams, Excadrill can be used as a wallbreaker, coming in on common Pokemon like Klefki and firing off powerful attacks; however, common support Arceus formes check Excadrill, so be careful in firing off attacks recklessly, as that will result in Excadrill fainting to Life Orb recoil and not achieving much. It can also outpace most Ho-Oh and revenge kill Ho-Oh with Rock Slide if it needs to in a pinch. If Excadrill is running Life Orb and you intend to attempt to sweep with it, be careful you don't get it whittled down too much to sweep in the process of wallbreaking.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sand support from Tyranitar is mandatory with this set. Without sand, this set cannot function nearly as well against offensive teams, although it does retain some utility in its matchup against bulkier teams by means of its wallbreaking power and good defensive typing, as well as its access to Rapid Spin. Good answers for Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon are incredibly important, because they reset the weather and the weather they set cannot be overridden by Tyranitar's sand. Pokemon like Latias and Latios can handle both Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon, and other options like Primal Groudon itself and Arceus-Water can handle one of them each. Excadrill provides good Rapid Spin support for Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence, which can in turn help Excadrill by wearing down mutual checks like Arceus-Water. Special attackers like Xerneas and Darkrai appreciate Excadrill being able to counter Klefki, as it results in their being able to play more recklessly, and they can be very difficult to handle when Klefki is removed from the picture. Dark-types like Darkrai and Yveltal can make good teammates due to their ability to take on Ghost-types like Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O, which can effectively deal with Excadrill.</p>"

  "Scolipede": {
    "overview": "<p>Scolipede secures a niche in Ubers by virtue of its support movepool and ability; Speed Boost allows it to outspeed every unboosted threat in Ubers at +1. Scolipede has a great movepool for a lead, with access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Pin Missile allows Scolipede to potentially OHKO Deoxys-S and Darkrai, and Endeavor allows it to cripple opposing leads. While Scolipede can be highly effective in some matchups, Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye completely shut it down by virtue of Magic Bounce, and Taunt users can prevent it from setting up entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Baton Pass can be used to gain momentum against Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie switch-ins, but fitting it on a moveset is difficult. Passing a Speed boost to Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Xerneas allows them to easily beat Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie. Poison Jab allows Scolipede to 2HKO offensive Xerneas, while a single Speed boost allows Scolipede to outspeed +2 Xerneas. Poison Jab also has a 30% chance to poison the foe, which cripples Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie. Rock Slide can deal heavy damage to Ho-Oh if it tries to switch in, but the move fails to OHKO. Superpower allows Scolipede to OHKO Tyranitar, but it has little to no utility outside of that.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye</strong>: Magic Bounce allows Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie to freely switch into Scolipede and potentially bounce back its entry hazards. This, paired with a great defensive typing and Will-O-Wisp, allows Mega Sableye to quickly wear down Scolipede, while Mega Diancie can OHKO it with Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar's Ghost / Poison typing grants it an immunity to Endeavor and a resistance to Pin Missile, while Shadow Tag prevents Scolipede from switching, leaving it vulnerable to Taunt and being 2HKOed by Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: By virtue of Parental Bond, Mega Kangaskhan is able to OHKO Scolipede, bypassing its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O's unique Ghost / Dragon typing grants it an immunity to Endeavor and a resistance to Pin Missile. Giratina-O also has access to Defog, allowing it to freely remove Scolipede's entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes</strong>: Bulky Arceus formes, especially Arceus-Ghost, are able to Defog away Scolipede's entry hazards and 2HKO it with Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Sand Stream paired with a Rock-type STAB attack allows Tyranitar to OHKO Scolipede through its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Sacred Fire has a 50% chance to burn, and defensive Ho-Oh often runs Substitute, rendering Endeavor much less effective against it.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Between Lava Plume, phazing in Dragon Tail, and Thunder Wave, Primal Groudon has the tools to easily remove Scolipede while reducing its ability to set entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave + Defog</strong>: The pairing of Klefki and defensive Mega Salamence in particular cripples Scolipede and allows Mega Salamence to Defog away entry hazards and OHKO Scolipede with Return or phaze it with Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mewtwo X</strong>: Mega Mewtwo X's Low Kick does minimal damage to Scolipede, greatly reducing the effectiveness of Endeavor, while Pin Missile does little damage in return. After this, Mega Mewtwo X can proceed to KO Scolipede with Stone Edge or Earthquake. In addition, Mega Mewtwo X provides a fast Taunt, which can prevent Scolipede from laying down entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Leads</strong>: Yveltal, Greninja, and Forretress can beat Scolipede one-on-one and limit the number of entry hazards it can lay down.</p> <p>Defensive Yveltal and Greninja can Taunt Scolipede, limiting it to one layer of entry hazards. Foul Play from defensive Yveltal can 2HKO Scolipede, and Yveltal can proceed to KO with Sucker Punch if Scolipede uses Endeavor. Offensive Yveltal can bring Scolipede down to 1 HP and KO Scolipede if it tries to attack.</p> <p>Thanks to Protean, Greninja becomes immune to Endeavor and gains a resistance to Pin Missile when it uses Shadow Sneak.</p> <p>Forretress can spin away Scolipede's entry hazards while laying down its own.</p> <p>Aegislash can 2HKO Scolipede with Gyro Ball, but it has no way of preventing Scolipede from laying down two layers of entry hazards.</p>",

      "Spikes Anti-Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pin Missile is used over Megahorn in order to break Focus Sashes on Deoxys-S, Deoxys-A, and Darkrai. Toxic Spikes is usually preferred over Spikes, as other Spikes users such as Klefki do this better, though both can be run on the same set. Protect allows Scolipede to gain a free Speed boost so that it can outspeed Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Deoxys-A while avoiding a Dark Void or Taunt. Earthquake can be used to 2HKO Mega Diancie, Mega Gengar, and Klefki, and to deal a decent amount of damage to Primal Groudon. Toxic cripples Defog users such as Giratina-O, support Arceus formes, Latios, and Latias, as well as bulky Pokemon that give hyper offense teams trouble, such as Tyranitar and Ho-Oh.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack allows Scolipede to OHKO Deoxys-S with Pin Missile as long as it hits three times and Darkrai if it hits four times. Maximum Speed investment is used so that Scolipede can outspeed Latios and Latias. Alternatively, a spread of 56 HP / 252 Atk / 200 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Scolipede to outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Mega Salamence while adding a little bit of extra bulk.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scolipede should only be used on hyper offense teams, as it lacks the defensive utility necessary for other archetypes. Scolipede should be used as a lead unless your opponent has an anti-lead such as Mega Gengar, Mega Sableye, Mega Diancie, or Giratina-O, in which case you should lead with another Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre or Xerneas. If your opponent leads with Darkrai, using Protect turn one is recommended to block Dark Void and allow Scolipede to outspeed Darkrai next turn. If your opponent leads with Deoxys-S or Deoxys-A, using Pin Missile on the first turn limits their chances to set up entry hazards. When Scolipede has been brought down to its Focus Sash, using Endeavor brings the opponent's Pokemon down to 1 HP, allowing other team members to easily revenge kill it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scolipede is only viable on hyper offense teams, so Pokemon commonly found on hyper offense such as Mega Salamence, Xerneas, and Arceus work well. Darkrai in particular shuts down Defog users via Dark Void and Taunt, making it difficult to remove Scolipede's entry hazards, but Darkrai lacks offensive synergy, as it is checked by Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie. Mewtwo, along with its Mega Evolutions, provides a fast Taunt and enjoys having foes worn down with poison damage, but Mewtwo lacks defensive synergy with Scolipede.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre and Xerneas pair well with Scolipede, as they can check Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye. Faster Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y are able to outspeed and OHKO Mega Gengar, but they lack the ability to trap it. Shaymin-S as well as Substitute users such as Xerneas appreciate opposing Pokemon being worn down by poison. Mixed Xerneas can beat Mega Sableye, as well as Ho-Oh and Blissey with Rock Slide and Close Combat, respectively. If Protect isn't used, a Sleep Talk user such as Choice Scarf Zekrom pairs nicely with Scolipede to beat Darkrai leads.</p>"

  "Gothitelle": {
    "overview": "<p>Gothitelle is the most vile answer to support Arceus formes and Defoggers in the tier. The centralization of the metagame around a great number of threats such as Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Xerneas has made role compression unavoidable, resulting in teams that rely on Pokemon such as Klefki, support Arceus formes, Latias, and Latios to glue builds together. Gothitelle is capable of trapping all of these Pokemon with Calm Mind alongside its expansive support movepool that allows it to specify its trapping pool or broaden its utility with moves such as Thunder Wave, Tickle, and Heal Bell. In fact, it's not much of a stretch to say that it turns what would otherwise be a valuable asset to your opponent's team into a liability.</p> <p>However, the physically offensive metagame especially prevents Gothitelle from excelling in the Uber tier, while its already existent flaws such as average stats, aversion to Dark-types, and little utility against offensive teams are more noticeable than ever. In comparison to other Shadow Tag users, it can be somewhat difficult to justify using, as Wobbuffet has superior bulk and more general utility with Encore, while Mega Gengar possesses an array of options that make it consistent across all matchups with Speed and power to boot. However, Gothitelle's unique trapping pool consisting of dominant threats such as Klefki and support Arceus formes and its ability to eliminate these threats with minimal risk while not taking up a Mega slot give this evil mistress the title of the best breaker of balance and stall in the metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic is an alternative STAB option that allows Gothitelle to trap and eliminate Skarmory, and it should only be run with 44 Speed EVs and Taunt in order to accumulate boosts and prevent Skarmory from setting up Spikes, phazing Gothitelle, or using Taunt itself. A defensive spread with a Bold nature can allow Gothitelle to trap Mega Diancie, but it has little use outside of this, and the lack of EVs invested into Special Defense will make Gothitelle take significantly more damage from the likes of Arceus's Judgment and Latios's Draco Meteor. Heal Bell can further Gothitelle's supportive role by curing all status ailments from its team. While it does not expand Gothitelle's trapping pool, it creates a more favorable matchup against stall and balance teams. Magic Coat allows Gothitelle to bounce back entry hazards when trapping support Pokemon such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Dialga, but it is difficult to justify over Thunder Wave and Tickle, which actually expand Gothitelle's trapping pool. Miracle Eye can allow Gothitelle to pick up extra KOs after what it initially traps, but Gothitelle's purpose is to take out key members of the opponent's team, and the move does not help it in this regard. Trick Room allows Gothitelle to possibly sweep late-game when Dark-types have been removed and can also curb Speed-boosting setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas and Rock Polish Groudon. It has a niche on Trick Room teams, but it is gimmicky and counterintuitive, as Gothitelle is meant to trap Defoggers, and the move does not help it fulfill this role whatsoever. Gothitelle's moveset and EV spread can be designed to eliminate almost any specific threat of your choice; experiment!</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Mega Sableye, Yveltal, and Darkrai find free turns against Gothitelle to either spread status ailments, attack, or set up, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to trapping abilities like that of Shadow Tag and can retaliate with super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Shed Shell</strong>: Any Pokemon holding this item that would otherwise be trapped by Gothitelle can escape its grip and switch out to a teammate that can threaten it, such as a Pursuit trapper.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence can overwhelm Gothitelle with their powerful attacks, thwarting any attempt to trap them, and can revenge kill it after it KOes a foe.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Tyranitar is immune to Psyshock, and Mega Scizor can outspeed and pivot out of Gothitelle with a super effective STAB U-turn; however, Gothitelle can defeat Tyranitar by utilizing Tickle.</p> <p><strong>Pivots</strong>: Pivots with U-turn such as Landorus-T and Jirachi can avoid being trapped and deal solid damage to Gothitelle with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Gothitelle fails to trap and remove any Pokemon with Taunt, because the move prevents it from setting up Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Phazing Moves</strong>: Any phazing move forces out Gothitelle and prevents it from setting up Calm Mind.</p>",

      "Literally Satan... Again (Calm Mind)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind raises Gothitelle's Special Attack in order to eliminate support Arceus formes and other miscellaneous support Pokemon and also boosts its Special Defense so that Gothitelle can withstand special attacks such as Dialga's Flash Cannon. Psyshock is the preferred coverage move so that Gothitelle can have an easier time eliminating specially defensive behemoths such as Blissey and Kyogre and gain the edge in Calm Mind wars against Arceus formes. Rest cures any status ailments inflicted upon Gothitelle and restores its HP so that it can gather more boosts and subsequently eliminate a threat. The last slot is entirely free to whatever is most fulfilling to Gothitelle's evil doings. Thunder Wave aids in Calm Mind wars with Arceus formes and can curb setup from the likes of Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Xerneas; Tickle augments the strength of Psyshock along with Calm Mind by lowering the foe's Defense, which helps eliminate Pokemon such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong while also thwarting Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar by lowering their Attack before Gothitelle switches out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Shadow Tag is what makes Gothitelle so dangerous, letting it trap valuable assets to stall and balance teams such as Arceus-Water, Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Latias. Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Sassy nature ensures that Gothitelle can trap Arceus formes and other Pokemon such as Latias, Dialga, defensive Primal Kyogre, and some special attackers such as Choice Scarf Xerneas and Choice Scarf Kyurem-W; the investments even let Gothitelle survive fully invested Xerneas's +2 Moonblast 62.5% of the time so it can cripple Xerneas with Thunder Wave. Leftovers gives Gothitelle passive recovery, which helps tremendously in Calm Mind wars with Arceus formes. A 3 Speed IV allows Gothitelle to outspeed standard +2 Geomancy Xerneas that has been paralyzed with Thunder Wave so it can hit it with Psyshock before being KOed; it also reduces the power of Ferrothorn's and Bronzong's Gyro Ball as much as possible to ease setting up, especially if Gothitelle is not running Tickle. However, if Tickle is used, a 24 Speed IV and a Calm nature should be used to weaken Bronzong's and Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball as much as possible while letting Gothitelle outspeed uninvested Tyranitar in order for Gothitelle to use Tickle against it before possibly being crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Trap and eliminate key members of the opposing team to facilitate a sweep for a teammate. Gothitelle is considerably bulky and can switch into Pokemon such as support Arceus formes and Latias and begin setting up. However, in the same respect, do not overestimate its bulk and switch it into attackers with heavy Special Attack investment such as Xerneas; instead, let the target pick off a weakened or unimportant teammate so that Gothitelle can come in healthy. Another method of getting Gothitelle into the playing field safely is by double switching, but it is much riskier and reliant on properly reading the opponent's plays. It's also worth noting that the purpose of Shadow Tag is to dismember defensive cores, and just because Gothitelle requires Calm Mind to do this does not mean that it should be withheld until it can sweep.</p> <p>Shadow Tag alone gives your team a significant advantage because your opponent must make risky plays to prevent their Pokemon from being trapped. Gothitelle's trapping pool is quite dependent on its moveset because its options in Thunder Wave and Tickle are largely situational, being used to aid in fulfilling specific roles and eliminating extremely specific threats. Use Thunder Wave to level Calm Mind wars with Arceus formes and to put Gothitelle into a favorable position against Defog Latios and Latias so that it can boost beside these threats and eliminate them, opening holes for sweepers such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Calm Mind Arceus, and Calm Mind Primal Kyogre. Use Tickle to cripple Steel-types such as Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong to open holes for Pokemon such as Xerneas, Latios, Mewtwo, and Calm Mind Arceus. Although Gothitelle can trap these Pokemon without Tickle on paper, it is recommended to run this option in order to achieve maximum results against these Pokemon to suppress their general counterplay against Gothitelle; for example, Klefki has the option of running Heal Block, and Ferrothorn has the option of running Power Whip. You must also be wary of the consequences of trapping these two specific threats—both have access to Spikes and will set up full entry hazards during the turns they are trapped, so be sure that your entry hazard remover is healthy and can find a reasonable opportunity to clear the entry hazards set by the foe. Keep note that regardless of Gothitelle's support option, it is able to trap any standard Blissey without Shed Shell and any support Arceus, bar Arceus-Ghost, that has the formulaic moveset of a special STAB attack, a status move, Recover, and Defog.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Means of checking Dark-types are necessary, as Gothitelle cannot touch them whatsoever. Ho-Oh makes for a solid check to Arceus-Dark and Darkrai when running Sleep Talk, and Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas are good choices as well because of their type advantage over Dark-types. Entry hazards are indispensable to pressure support Arceus formes and Defoggers that are not Giratina or Arceus-Ghost into coming onto the field and using Defog, which leaves them vulnerable to being trapped. Spikers such as Skarmory, Klefki, and Ferrothorn are all excellent choices to check a myriad of threats Gothitelle is weak to; additionally, Primal Groudon is the best Stealth Rock setter overall, and it can bait Pokemon such as Arceus-Water and Latias. Mega Diancie is another Stealth Rock setter that works well with Gothitelle, as it appreciates Gothitelle's ability to eliminate Arceus-Water and Arceus-Grass while also serving as a check to Dark-types; it even frees Primal Groudon from Stealth Rock duty, allowing it to run an offensive set that synergizes exceptionally well with Gothitelle. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Arceus-Water, Arceus-Dragon, Arceus-Rock, and non-Primal Groudon can switch into the likes of Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence, giving Gothitelle a defensive backbone that allows it to avoid being revenge killed after a successful trap. Ghost-types are immune to the effects of Shadow Tag, so Dark-types such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark, which can check them, make for good teammates as well.</p> <p>Gothitelle is a standalone Pokemon that does not require much support; however, some notable Pokemon are especially good teammates to it. Flying-types such as Mega Salamence and Ho-Oh wear down Tyranitar and keep Mega Scizor at bay, giving Gothitelle more room to breathe. Although Ghost-types stack a weakness to Dark-types, they can sustain the matchup against teams opting for Rapid Spin instead of Defog by spinblocking and keeping entry hazards in play.</p>"

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alomomola is an interesting option for stall teams that need a Wish passer. Unlike most Wish passers in Ubers, Alomomola checks physical attackers, such as Ho-Oh and Extreme Killer Arceus, instead of special attackers. It also has a pretty good defensive typing, as Electric- and Grass-type attacks are uncommon in Ubers. Unfortunately, Alomomola has zero offensive presence, meaning it's setup bait for almost anything carrying Taunt, Substitute, or Refresh. This means it can only fit on stall teams that can provide cleric support and don't mind Alomomola's lack of offensive presence. Alomomola also cannot take special attacks well at all, meaning it is forced out against mixed attackers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alomomola can use Healing Wish to completely restore a teammate's health, but it is hard to justify using this move when Wish is far more consistent for stall teams because it can be used more than once. Magic Coat punishes status and entry hazard users, but is gimmicky and can easily be played around once it is revealed. Refresh can be used to heal off status, but cleric support is preferred because Refresh is extremely hard to fit on Alomomola. Finally, Mirror Coat can be used to surprise special attackers. An EV spread of 120 HP / 165 Def / 232 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to guarantee that Alomomola can survive a Draco Meteor from Timid Latios after Stealth Rock damage and OHKO Latios back with Mirror Coat. Be aware that the significant Special Defense investment needed to make Mirror Coat work detracts from Alomomola's ability to check Ho-Oh and other physical attackers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Shaymin-S</strong>: Shaymin-S easily OHKOes Alomomola with Seed Flare and doesn't mind Knock Off or Scald much. Shaymin-S can also use Substitute on a predicted Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Even though Zekrom's Choice Scarf set cannot OHKO Alomomola with Bolt Strike, Zekrom can easily spam Volt Switch for momentum, which will severely damage Alomomola if it stays in.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Electric and Arceus-Grass</strong>: Both Arceus-Electric and Arceus-Grass defeat Alomomola courtesy of their typing, although they must be wary of switching in on Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Substitute and Refresh Users</strong>: Pokemon that have Substitute or Refresh will easily set up on Alomomola due to its lack of offensive presence. This includes Pokemon that Alomomola would otherwise be able to check, such as Silk Scarf Extreme Killer Arceus.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can trap and remove Alomomola with its powerful special attacks, although it is 2HKOed by Knock Off before it Mega Evolves.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Darkrai can shut down Alomomola by preventing recovery and stopping Toxic spam.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers will quickly decimate Alomomola in the event that it stays in.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With a monstrous base 165 HP stat, Alomomola is capable of restoring most of its teammates to full health, even in a tier where many Pokemon have large HP stats. Huge Wishes are extremely beneficial for Pokemon without reliable recovery, such as Ferrothorn and Primal Groudon. Protect allows Alomomola to safely receive its own Wishes and scout for Choice-locked moves. Toxic cripples threats Alomomola is supposed to check, such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon; Alomomola can then attempt to stall them out. Toxic also cripples overeager special attackers that switch in to prey on Alomomola's terrible Special Defense stat. Alomomola has two quality options for its last slot. It can opt to run Knock Off, which can 2HKO Mega Gengar and cripple opposing walls such as Ferrothorn, or can attempt to burn the foe with Scald. Knock Off is generally preferred, as it offers further team support by removing potentially dangerous items such as Life Orb.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Alomomola's EV spread is very simple: maximize HP and Defense to tank hits from Ho-Oh and other physical attackers as well as possible. If running Knock Off, use an Impish nature, but if you opt for Scald, use a Bold nature. Rocky Helmet is an option over Leftovers to deal passive damage to Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, but in conjunction with Protect, Alomomola has an easier time taking on Primal Groudon and Choice Band Ho-Oh with Leftovers recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>When facing an offensive team that lacks a cleric or a status absorber, it's advised to use Toxic liberally. This is because these teams are likely to hard switch into special attackers such as Xerneas and Primal Kyogre to try to take advantage of a predicted Wish. By using Toxic a lot, you prevent offensive teams from seizing momentum. However, do try to heal your teammates with Wish when the opportunity arises. Against more defensive teams, Knock Off becomes incredibly useful, as you can rob enemy walls, such as Lugia and Ferrothorn, of their Leftovers. You will also find more opportunities to pass Wishes to teammates. Alomomola dislikes all status, but hates Toxic in particular, so if a foe does manage to land a Toxic on it, have a cleric heal it as soon as possible. Finally, take advantage of Regenerator by switching Alomomola into Pokemon that cannot threaten it, such as Mega Sableye, when it starts to lose health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ferrothorn is a great partner for Alomomola, as it resists both of Alomomola's weaknesses and checks Primal Kyogre while Alomomola provides huge Wishes and a check to Ho-Oh in return. Clefable is another viable teammate for Alomomola, as the Calm Mind set stops Geomancy Xerneas and most Calm Mind Arceus formes. Clefable can also use Heal Bell in the event Alomomola is afflicted with a status ailment. Alomomola appreciates Pursuit support to help deal with Mega Gengar; Aegislash and Chople Berry Tyranitar do a good job of this. Finally, Primal Groudon partners well with Alomomola because it can check Xerneas, Primal Kyogre, and Electric-types such as Zekrom.</p>"

Ferrothorn's support movepool is very large, consisting of moves such as Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Spikes, and Leech Seed. Its decent Attack stat combined with Gyro Ball allows it to check many fast threats such as Mega Gengar and Xerneas. However, Ferrothorn is rendered useless by Taunt, is very slow, and has a nasty 4x weakness to Fire-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>You can opt to run Rocky Helmet over Leftovers to heavily damage Pokemon that use contact moves; however, the passive recovery from Leftovers is usually more useful.

However, Mega Blaziken and Ho-Oh are neutered by Thunder Wave and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Yveltal completely shut Ferrothorn down but must be wary of Gyro Ball, Leech Seed, and status.</p> <p><strong>Darkrai</strong>: Darkrai can easily cripple Ferrothorn with Dark Void and proceed to use it as setup fodder if running Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye stops Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards and takes little damage from its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Primal Groudon can easily beat Ferrothorn with Fire Punch, and Rayquaza can easily break through it with Dragon Ascent or V-create. Mega Salamence takes little damage from Gyro Ball and is unaffected by status if it is running Refresh, while it can easily render Ferrothorn setup fodder. However, all of them are annoyed by Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage Moves</strong>: Ferrothorn must be wary around Pokemon that commonly use Fire-type coverage moves, such as Fire Blast Dialga, Palkia, and Mewtwo as well as the occasional Hidden Power Fire Mega Diancie and Xerneas.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ferrothorn is one of the best entry hazard setters in Ubers thanks to its solid bulk. It fares very well against the most common Defoggers, Latios and Latias, especially if it is running a status move such as Toxic. Spikes allows Ferrothorn to pressure defensive teams, deterring them from switching. Gyro Ball is used to heavily damage faster Pokemon such as Mega Gengar and Xerneas, while Power Whip hits Kyogre, Arceus-Ground, and Palkia hard; it also packs quite a punch against neutral targets. Leech Seed helps Ferrothorn recover health and, combined with entry hazards, can be used to chip away at the foe's health. Protect works well with Leech Seed and Leftovers, allowing Ferrothorn to recover HP while scouting against Choice-locked Pokemon. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple setup sweepers, but it should not be used with Gyro Ball, as Thunder Wave will lower Gyro Ball's power. Toxic wears down common switch-ins to Ferrothorn such as support Arceus formes and Defog users; as such, it has good synergy with Spikes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Iron Barbs helps Ferrothorn wear down physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan. Leftovers gives Ferrothorn some passive recovery, helping it avoid some crucial 2HKOs and 3HKOs. 252 HP and Special Defense EVs allow Ferrothorn to better check special attackers, such as Kyogre, while a Sassy nature further boosts Ferrothorn's special bulk. 0 Speed IVs should be used with Gyro Ball to strengthen it. Investing in Defense is also not a bad idea, as it helps Ferrothorn check powerful physical attackers such as Swords Dance Arceus variants with more ease.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>You should aim to use Ferrothorn's good defensive typing and bulk to your advantage by using it to set up entry hazards. Ferrothorn should be taking hits and trying to wear down the opposing Pokemon with residual damage from Leech Seed, entry hazards, or Toxic. Around common Fire Blast or Focus Blast users such as Dialga, Palkia, and Mewtwo, use Protect to see if they have it. It should also be noted that Gyro Ball only has 8 PP, so use it only when you have to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ho-Oh is a good teammate for Ferrothorn, as the two work well together, and Ho-Oh appreciates Spikes support which wears down its checks and counters. Lugia can switch in to Fighting-types and a few Fire-types easily and phaze its foes to take advantage of Spikes. Arceus-Water can check Ho-Oh and other Fire-types in general as well; it can also provide Defog support. Setup sweepers appreciate Ferrothorn setting up entry hazards and using Toxic and Leech Seed to wear down bulky walls that they cannot muscle past. Ferrothorn also enjoys cleric support from Pokemon such as Blissey or Clefable, as it is easily worn down by burn damage.</p>"

However, it faces competition from Kyurem-W, which has more spammable STAB moves, is faster, and hits harder. Additionally, sun support is now virtually non-existent thanks to Primal Kyogre. Reshiram is also easily worn down by all forms of entry hazards, limiting it to being an average wallbreaker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs may be used to hit slightly harder, and either Dragon Pulse or Focus Blast can be used over Roost, but the inability to switch moves is very easily taken advantage of, as Reshiram's moves have popular switch-ins. A Choice Scarf can be used with a similar set for revenge killing, but it doesn't hit hard enough, and locking Reshiram into a move is easily taken advantage of. Dragon Pulse is a weaker STAB move with no other downside to it, but the lack in power is noticeable. Focus Blast hits Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock very hard, both of which don't take much from Reshiram's other moves. Earth Power is another option Reshiram has to hit incoming Diancie. Toxic threatens bulky Calm Mind Arceus formes that try to set up on Reshiram.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, Latias, Latios, Excadrill under sand, and Mega Salamence can either revenge kill Reshiram from full health or do so after little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock and Water Arceus</strong>: Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Water can take any hit from Reshiram and Recover off the damage. Arceus-Rock should be wary of Focus Blast, though.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar can switch in on any attack and force Reshiram out unless it is carrying Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Reshiram really despises Stealth Rock, as it is easily worn down by Life Orb recoil as is and normally has difficulty getting a Roost off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Primal Kyogre</strong>: Bulky variants of Primal Kyogre can easily come in on any attack and force Reshiram out, which allows a free turn to use Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh can easily wall Reshiram in the absence of Stealth Rock and if Reshiram isn't running Stone Edge.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor and Blue Flare are Reshiram's strongest STAB moves and deal huge damage to anything that doesn't resist them or is Blissey. Blue Flare also has a handy chance to burn. Roost helps to regain HP lost to recoil, entry hazards, and chip damage. Stone Edge has only one target: Ho-Oh, which otherwise easily walls Reshiram if Stealth Rock is not set up. Tailwind can be used over Stone Edge to have some speed control and to either help Reshiram sweep by itself or help the team when Reshiram is low on health.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs produce maximum offensive output. A Timid nature allows Reshiram to Speed tie or outspeed other base 90 Speed Pokemon and outspeed neutral-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon. Life Orb is used to hit hard while being able to switch moves, as locking Reshiram into any move gives a free turn to big threats: Blue Flare is a free switch for Primal Kyogre, Latias, and Latios, and Draco Meteor gives a free switch to Xerneas and Klefki. Flame Plate is a slightly weaker alternative that only boosts Fire-type attacks while causing no recoil and still allowing switching of moves. However, without Life Orb, Reshiram misses out on the OHKO on Ho-Oh.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Reshiram should almost never be switched in on a damaging move, even though it's decently bulky, because it'll be taking lot of recoil and entry hazard damage already. Scizor and Ferrothorn provide switches for Reshiram, giving it a turn to fire off a strong attack and dent the opposing team. The use of moves such as Volt Switch and U-turn can provide opportunities for Reshiram to come in safely, such as when the opponent switches to a Pokemon that Reshiram can force out or threaten. Draco Meteor is slightly more spammable than Blue Flare because an opposing Xerneas or Klefki will almost never switch in due to fear of Blue Flare. Because Primal Kyogre can take both attacks rather well, it's more likely to switch in, and a Blue Flare is pretty much a free switch. Tailwind should be used either when Reshiram can clean by itself with the Speed boost or when it's low on health so it can help the team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Latias and Latios are good teammates, as they can handle Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre while also providing Defog support and appreciate the removal of Steel-types. Support Arceus-Ghost helps Reshiram by burning Extreme Killer Arceus and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground while also providing Defog support. Geomancy Xerneas complements Reshiram by checking Tyranitar and bulky Arceus formes, while Reshiram gets rid of Steel-types and significantly weakens Primal Groudon. Regular Groudon can set up Stealth Rock to keep Ho-Oh in check while being a decent check to Primal Groudon that lack special attacks and Ho-Oh. Bulky Fairy-types can switch in on other Dragon-types for Reshiram, while Reshiram helps them by removing the Steel-types.</p>"

Unfortunately, Zekrom is one of many Pokemon that struggles against Primal Groudon. Though Zekrom can deal damage to Primal Groudon, the latter's bulk makes it a tough opponent for Zekrom. Moreover, Zekrom has trouble spamming its STAB attacks because Fairy- and Ground-type Pokemon are each immune to one of them. Base 90 Speed is also not good enough, as Zekrom needs a Choice Scarf to outspeed important threats such as Arceus, Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo.</p>",

Magnet Rise can be used on a predicted switch in order to make Zekrom immune to Ground-type moves.

Bolt Strike complements Zekrom's Dragon STAB type well, hitting Xerneas and other Fairy-types for sizable damage. With just Stealth Rock support, it achieves OHKOs on many significant defensive threats such as Lugia, Arceus-Water, and Yveltal. Dragon Claw is the preferred primary Dragon-type move, as it offers consistency in comparison to Outrage, which has a locking effect that the opponent can take advantage of. In the last slot, Outrage is the preferred move because it grants Zekrom the power necessary for breaking Ground-types, in particular Primal Groudon. However, Substitute is another option that may be used in the last slot to ease prediction, avoid status, and expand Zekrom's setup opportunities, allowing it to set up on Pokemon that would normally wall it, such as Ferrothorn. Notably, it gives Zekrom an edge versus stall teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment ensures that Primal Groudon with 56 Defense EVs and a Defense-boosting nature is always 2HKOed by a boosted Outrage. The HP investment allows Zekrom to always avoid a 2HKO from Jolly Life Orb Arceus's Extreme Speed after taking Stealth Rock damage, letting Zekrom be a last-ditch check to it. The HP EVs also allow Zekrom to survive +2 Jolly Arceus-Ground's Earthquake when at full health in conjunction with Shuca Berry and to never be OHKOed by Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam. The remaining EVs are invested into Speed to allow Zekrom to outspeed Geomancy Xerneas with 44 Speed EVs and a neutral nature. An Adamant nature is necessary for breaking Ground-types; a Jolly nature should never be considered. Shuca Berry allows Zekrom to soft check boosted Mega Salamence and Extreme Killer Arceus, as well as tank any unboosted Ground-type attack from the likes of Primal Groudon in order to set up Hone Claws or 2HKO using Outrage with an already acquired boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Zekrom into something it can force out, and set up Hone Claws. The beauty of this set is that it is not prediction heavy, unlike Zekrom's other sets; simply force a switch, boost, and see what comes in. Passive Steel-types, such as Klefki, Jirachi, and Skarmory, are Zekrom's primary targets to set up on. Furthermore, a myriad of Flying-types within the tier such as Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal are easy targets to set up on as well. However, scout for status users before setting up, especially ones with Will-O-Wisp. It is imperative to assess trade-offs—the sole purpose of this set is to lure in and eliminate Zekrom's usual checks and counters in order to ease the sweep of a teammate, so play it aggressively according to this function. However, do not senselessly use Outrage, as Xerneas and other Fairy-types can use Zekrom locked into Outrage as setup fodder. In order to allow safe use of Outrage, eliminate Fairy-types beforehand, or be sure your checks to Fairy-types are healthy enough to subdue them once they have set up. If Substitute is chosen for the last slot, use it to avoid status moves and to punish switches. The main draw of Substitute is to allow Zekrom to set up on Ferrothorn, however it is not recommended to challenge it in a one-versus-one situation. Additionally, bluffing a Choice set early-game can prove fruitful late-game to lure in Fairy-types and Ground-types. Doing so may allow Zekrom to net additional KOs or setup opportunities. Lastly, keep Zekrom healthy if it is needed to check Mega Salamence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Geomancy Xerneas and Choice Scarf Xerneas have a much easier time sweeping once opposing Primal Groudon have been weakened by Zekrom's boosted Dragon-type attacks. In return, Xerneas can switch into Dragon-type attacks aimed at Zekrom. Primal Kyogre especially benefits from Zekrom running Substitute because with it Zekrom virtually walls Ferrothorn, Primal Kyogre's most sturdy check. Zekrom and Primal Kyogre also pressure Primal Groudon immensely, overall making for a nice offensive core that wears down each other's checks. Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Ghost, Ice, Steel, and Ground also make for nice offensive partners, as they appreciate Zekrom's ability to check and eliminate Ho-Oh. The former three's aversion to Thunder Wave from the likes of Klefki is also alleviated by Zekrom's immunity to the move. Primal Groudon can absorb Will-O-Wisp aimed at Zekrom, set up Stealth Rock, and inflict status with Thunder Wave or Toxic on the checks and counters it shares with Zekrom. In addition to being a blanket check to Fairy-types, Primal Groudon also defeats Ferrothorn and Arceus-Grass, two of Zekrom's best checks, with its super effective Fire-type moves. Additional entry hazard support in Spikes and Toxic Spikes is greatly appreciated; Toxic Spikes complements Substitute especially well. Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Forretress are excellent choices; though they stack weaknesses to Primal Groudon, they all appreciate that Ho-Oh is checked by Zekrom. Ground-type checks are greatly appreciated, even though this set's purpose is to lure them in. Yveltal, Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Skarmory are all excellent; the latter can also provide Spikes to aid Zekrom's wallbreaking prowess. Last but not least, Mega Gengar can trap and eliminate Fairy-types, and it can also keep down entry hazards with Taunt.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bolt Strike demolishes anything that isn't a Ground-type. Outrage hits Pokemon that resist or are immune to Bolt Strike such as Arceus-Grass and Landorus-T and gives Zekrom a fighting chance against offensive variants of Primal Groudon. Draco Meteor hits Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Groudon, and Volt Switch allows Zekrom to maintain momentum for its team while simultaneously inflicting decent damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is necessary for Zekrom to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. A Naughty nature is preferred over Naive in order to 2HKO Electric-neutral, bulky variants of Arceus with Bolt Strike. Teravolt is useful for dealing serious damage to Lugia through Multiscale.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is typically used on offensive teams that desire both a revenge killer and a dedicated late-game cleaner, as well as a Pokemon that has the ability to outspeed common threats such as Latios, Latias, and Extreme Killer Arceus. Zekrom will be switching in and out often, so don't let it get worn down by repeated attacks and passive damage. Generally, Zekrom should only enter the battlefield on a free switch or a predicted Thunder Wave. When in doubt, scout with Volt Switch, but don't abuse it because Ground-types can block it completely. As all of Zekrom's moves have common immunities, prediction is very important in order to conserve momentum for your team. Predict incorrectly and Zekrom will be unable to effectively deal damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support will turn some of Zekrom's 2HKOs into OHKOs, particularly against Lugia, Skarmory, and defensive variants of Yveltal. Primal Kyogre takes on the Ground-types that give Zekrom a hard time in Ubers, particularly Primal Groudon. Ho-Oh also has great defensive synergy with Zekrom due to its massive Special Defense, resistances to Fairy- and Grass-type moves, and immunity to Ground-type moves. Mega Gengar can switch in on Ground-type moves thanks to Levitate before it Mega Evolves and can trap and KO most other threats to Zekrom such as Xerneas. Zekrom also forms a great VoltTurn core with Mega Scizor, which can be switched into Xerneas or Mega Diancie.</p>"

      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bolt Strike is an incredibly powerful STAB attack that plows through anything that doesn't resist it. Outrage is the best choice for a secondary STAB attack, hitting Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types which have no trouble taking a Bolt Strike. Alternatively, Dragon Claw can be used if Zekrom does not wish to be locked into Outrage and confused, though Zekrom usually prefers Outrage's power. Volt Switch is the best option in the fourth slot to help Zekrom pivot around and maintain momentum for its team. Tailwind can act as a pseudo-Agility and help Zekrom outspeed the entire unboosted metagame while giving its teammates a temporary Speed boost. However, Focus Blast can be used instead if your team struggles against Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is necessary for Zekrom to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. A Naughty nature is preferred over Naive because Zekrom finds maximum Attack to be more useful than maximum Speed. Teravolt is useful to OHKO Lugia through Multiscale. If running Focus Blast, an EV spread of 160 Atk / 96 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to always 2HKO Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The one-two punch of Draco Meteor and Outrage is a great way to lure and KO most Ground-types, including Primal Groudon. Because Zekrom is not locked into a move, its attacks are much more spammable than usual, as Zekrom can Volt Switch out of an unfavorable matchup as long as the foe is not a Ground-type. If running Tailwind, use it on a predicted switch, when Zekrom is about to be KOed, or when facing a foe that does not threaten Zekrom. Be sure to lure and KO opposing Ground-types that attempt to block Volt Switch. After the opponent has lost their Ground-types, use Volt Switch primarily on predicted switch-ins.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zekrom appreciates entry hazard support in order to help it sweep opposing teams more easily. Setters such as Landorus-T, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn can not only set up entry hazards but also take on the Ground-types that give Zekrom trouble. Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre have great defensive and offensive synergy, respectively, with Zekrom and appreciate Tailwind support to alleviate their somewhat low Speed stats. If running Volt Switch, Zekrom forms a good VoltTurn core with Scizor, which can deal with the Fairy-types that block Zekrom's Outrage. Pokemon that lose to Primal Groudon one-on-one, such as Xerneas, Mewtwo, and Extreme Killer Arceus, enjoy having Zekrom use Outrage to heavily damage Primal Groudon. Fairy-weak Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Arceus-Dark appreciate Zekrom's ability to dent Fairy-types with Bolt Strike as well.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bolt Strike is a very spammable STAB move that 2HKOes nearly everything that it hits neutrally. Outrage is Zekrom's second best bet against Pokemon that it cannot 2HKO with Bolt Strike, such as defensive Dialga. Dragon Claw is noticeably weaker than Outrage, but it does not prevent Zekrom from switching, so it can be more easily spammed in the presence of Steel-types such as Skarmory. Volt Switch maintains momentum, allowing Zekrom to pivot out of a predicted switch-in or a bad matchup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed make Zekrom hit as hard and as quickly as possible. An Adamant nature is preferred to boost Zekrom's Attack and not lower its defenses, though Naughty can be used if you do not wish to lower the power of Volt Switch. Teravolt allows Zekrom's Bolt Strike to OHKO Lugia through Multiscale.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set has the role of an extremely powerful wallbreaker, denting the defensive Pokemon that hyper offense teams struggle against. Because Ground- and Fairy-types stop Zekrom cold, you can't be reckless with this set despite its sheer power. Expert prediction is absolutely required to ensure Zekrom can break through opposing walls. Conversely, if you have eliminated your opponent's Fairy- and Ground-types, feel free to spam Outrage and Bolt Strike. To maximize your chances of landing a KO with Zekrom, bring it in against a slower Pokemon that it forces out, particularly Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, or Blissey, then use prediction to hit the switch-in with the proper STAB attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Zekrom's usual checks make for good partners. For example, Giratina-O and Blaziken enjoy having Xerneas and Primal Groudon defeated, respectively. Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre have great defensive and offensive synergy, respectively, with Zekrom, so both can take on the walls that Zekrom struggles against, such as Ferrothorn and Arceus-Ground. A Ground-immune Stealth Rock user such as Landorus-T can take Ground-type attacks aimed at Zekrom and wear down opposing walls, making it easier for Zekrom to break them. A pivot such as Genesect or Mega Scizor can form a VoltTurn core with Zekrom and get it in the battlefield unscathed.</p>"

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Landorus functions as a strong wallbreaker in Ubers thanks to the combination of Life Orb and Sheer Force, which provides it with a great amount of power while negating Life Orb recoil. It also has many coverage moves, making it difficult to switch into; however, it cannot run all of its coverage moves at the same time. Landorus's typing gives it an immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Ground-type attacks, as well as a neutrality to Stealth Rock. It has a decent base 101 Speed, which allows it to outspeed the many Uber Pokemon that have base Speed stats between 90 and 100, such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Rayquaza, and Xerneas. Unfortunately, Landorus is relatively frail, so it has difficulty switching in and doesn't offer much defensive utility besides being an offensive check to Arceus-Ground. Landorus also faces fierce competition with other stronger special attackers and wallbreakers in the Ubers metagame, making it nearly impossible to fit on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Landorus can be a decent Stealth Rock setter if none of its teammates can fill that role. Calm Mind allows Landorus to break through slower teams more easily, though it is still susceptible to being revenge killed by faster threats. Substitute eases prediction and makes Landorus more difficult to revenge kill, and Rock Polish can be used to make Landorus a fast setup sweeper; however, both Substitute and Rock Polish sets are easier to wall due to the loss of a coverage move. Grass Knot hits Primal Kyogre for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire can hit Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn for super effective damage, though Focus Blast tends to be more useful in general. U-turn can be used to gain momentum, wearing down Landorus's common checks in the process, as they will be forced out while taking damage from entry hazards and U-turn. Gravity is an interesting option that allows Landorus to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that have Levitate with Earth Power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia is immune to Earth Power and has exceptional bulk that allows it to take all of Landorus's attacks with ease. Lugia can then hit Landorus with a 4x super effective Ice Beam or phaze it with Whirlwind. However, Landorus can Knock Off Lugia's item in the process.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O has an immunity to Earth Power thanks to Levitate and cannot be 2HKOed by any of Landorus's other moves. Giratina-O can then hit Landorus with a powerful Shadow Force and proceed to pick it off with Shadow Sneak, or it can phaze Landorus with Dragon Tail. However, it cannot consistently counter Landorus because Giratina-O can be worn down relatively easily.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: While Skarmory does not do much damage to Landorus in return, it can switch into most of Landorus's attacks, use Roost to restore its HP, and set up Spikes. Skarmory must be wary of Focus Blast, however, which can easily 2HKO it and has a chance to OHKO it if Sturdy is not intact.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus</strong>: Support Arceus formes can switch into Landorus and use Recover and Judgment to deal with it; however, Arceus formes with little Speed investment can be outsped by Landorus and 2HKOed by Earth Power. Arceus-Grass is an especially good check to Landorus, as it resists Earth Power and can OHKO Landorus with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Latias and Latios</strong>: Latias and Latios are immune to Earth Power, outspeed Landorus, and threaten it with a powerful Draco Meteor. However, both Latias and Latios fear Knock Off, which will deal heavy damage and rid them of their coveted Soul Dew.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre struggles to switch into Landorus's Earth Power, but it can do so with sufficient bulk investment and threaten Landorus with a powerful Origin Pulse, Scald, or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types can switch into Landorus thanks to their immunity to Earth Power and proceed to threaten Landorus out. Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Landorus and 2HKOes it with Stone Edge. Shaymin-S is immune to Earth Power and threatens to outspeed and OHKO Landorus with a Life Orb-boosted Seed Flare or Hidden Power Ice. Rayquaza does not outspeed Landorus, but it can switch into Earth Power and threaten Landorus with a powerful Dragon Ascent or Draco Meteor; however, all three fear Rock Slide. Mega Salamence does not fear Rock Slide and threatens Landorus with Double-Edge and Return, but it must be wary of Hidden Power Ice, along with Shaymin-S and Rayquaza.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can revenge kill Landorus can beat it one-on-one or force it out, but they struggle to switch in. Mewtwo outspeeds Landorus and can OHKO it with Ice Beam or Ice Punch. Deoxys-A also outspeeds Landorus and can OHKO it with Ice Beam or Psycho Boost. Darkrai can put Landorus to sleep with Dark Void and set up with Nasty Plot; it also can KO Landorus with Dark Pulse if Landorus has taken a bit of prior damage. Finally, Choice Scarf Genesect outspeeds Landorus and can OHKO it with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attackers</strong>: Pokemon with priority moves can revenge kill a weakened Landorus, as it is relatively frail. Extreme Killer Arceus and Rayquaza can both hit Landorus with a strong Extreme Speed, while Mega Scizor can hit it with Bullet Punch and Yveltal can hit it with Sucker Punch.</p>",

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earth Power is Landorus's primary STAB move, which, when boosted by Life Orb and Sheer Force, hits most foes very hard. Knock Off hits Latias and Latios while crippling other switch-ins by removing their items. Rock Slide OHKOes Ho-Oh and hits other Flying-types for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ice primarily hits Mega Salamence and Rayquaza for super effective damage. Sludge Wave can also be used to hit Fairy-types and Grass- and Flying-types that resist or are immune to Earth Power, such as Arceus-Grass and Mega Salamence. Focus Blast is another viable option, as it hits Normal-types, such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Blissey, and Steel-types that Earth Power does not hit as hard, such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb boosts the power of Landorus's attacks and works well with Sheer Force, which offers additional power and cancels Life Orb recoil for most of Landorus's attacks besides Knock Off and Hidden Power. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize Landorus's power so that it can wallbreak more effectively, and 252 Speed EVs take advantage of Landorus's decent Speed tier. The remaining 4 EVs are invested in Attack to give slightly more power to Knock Off and Rock Slide. A Rash nature is preferred, as it allows Landorus to 2HKO most Arceus formes and OHKO all Primal Groudon variants; a Naive nature can also be used, as it gives Landorus additional Speed to always outspeed maximum Speed Pokemon with a base Speed stat between 90 and 100.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Landorus is frail and has difficulty taking hits consistently, so try to safely switch Landorus in via its immunities and double switching. Assess the importance of making trades, as some attacks may not OHKO a foe; however, sacrificing Landorus to weaken a foe may be worth it if said foe is threatening or if one of Landorus's teammates greatly benefits from the foe being weakened. Prediction is needed to hit switch-ins with the appropriate coverage move, as Landorus will be forced out by faster foes if they switch in safely using an immunity or resistance. It should be noted that Landorus can be worn down from Life Orb recoil when using Knock Off and Hidden Power; as such, if being healthy later on is important in order to avoid certain KOs, these moves should be used sparingly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dark-types make for good teammates, as they deal with Giratina-O, Latias, and Latios; Tyranitar is especially useful because it can trap Latias and Latios with Pursuit. Stealth Rock support is also useful because it weakens Flying-types that can switch into Landorus's Earth Power. Ghost-types are also good teammates for Landorus, as they can switch into Extreme Speed, which can be used to revenge KO Landorus. Mega Gengar is an especially useful teammate, as it can remove common checks to Landorus, such as Lugia, Skarmory, Shaymin-S, and some support Arceus formes. Primal Kyogre checks, such as Latias, Latios, and Primal Groudon, make for good partners as well. Fast sweepers, such as Xerneas, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Mega Salamence, appreciate Landorus's ability to break down walls so that they can sweep.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T's Ground immunity and powerful Earthquake allow it to check a variety of threats in Ubers, including Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Swords Dance Arceus, Klefki, and Mega Blaziken. Its ability Intimidate has good utility, allowing Landorus-T to pivot and simulate more physical bulk than it actually has. The interesting Ground / Flying typing makes it immune to Ground and Electric attacks but leaves it with an exploitable weakness to Ice. A high base 145 Attack gives Landorus-T the brute strength to threaten its foes, and its base 91 Speed sits just above the common base 90 Speed benchmark. Landorus-T has a solid physical movepool to play around with, including moves such as Explosion and U-turn, which are tools not available to other Ground-types in Ubers. Its immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes prevents it from becoming worn down as it pivots around. Although these traits are worthwhile, Landorus-T faces competition from Primal Groudon to some extent, which is slightly stronger, has better bulk, checks a larger portion of the metagame, and is immune to burns. Furthermore, what Landorus-T does check, it does not always check well in a defensive manner, as it is highly susceptible to burns and lacks an instant recovery move. It is also quite specially frail, taking significant damage from unboosted special attacks such as Moonblast, Draco Meteor, and Judgment.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Double Dance set with a Life Orb and a Jolly nature has the strength and Speed to break down an array of relevant threats; however, such a set is in steep competition with Arceus-Ground. A defensive Stealth Rock set is better at switching into strong physical attacks, but it lacks the ability to pivot as fluidly and isn't exceptionally good at breaking anything. Sleep Talk can be used on the Choice Scarf set to allow Landorus-T to switch into Darkrai's Dark Void, but it has little other use and Landorus-T isn't the best Pokemon to be switching into Darkrai in the first place.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Giratina Formes</strong>: Giratina-O is immune to Earthquake, Explosion, and Superpower and takes very little from Stone Edge and U-turn. In return, it can heavily damage Landorus-T with Draco Meteor or burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Giratina is so bulky that, despite taking neutral damage from Earthquake, it is able to effectively wall Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus</strong>: Support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Grass are bulky enough to wall Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong and Skarmory</strong>: Both Bronzong and Skarmory are immune to Landorus-T's Earthquake and take very little from any of its coverage options. In return, they can Toxic Landorus-T, set entry hazards, or whittle it down with offensive moves.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia is immune to Earthquake and, despite its weakness to Rock, doesn't take significant damage from Stone Edge. In return, Lugia can smack Landorus-T with Ice Beam or poison it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye can burn Landorus-T with Will-O-Wisp, smack it around with Foul Play, and recover away Earthquake damage.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Although Ferrothorn fears Superpower to some extent, it can Leech Seed Landorus-T and set up Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre has enough bulk to stomach one of Landorus-T's Earthquakes and can cleanly KO it with strong Water-type moves or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster can OHKO Landorus-T with Icicle Spear and has plenty of physical bulk to survive Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ice</strong>: Although it is hit hard by Superpower and Stone Edge, Arceus-Ice is rather bulky and can OHKO Landorus-T.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is the strongest move Landorus-T has to consistently dish out damage and trumps a variety of relevant targets. Stone Edge hits much of what Earthquake does not, such as Ho-Oh, offensive Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Shaymin-S, while also being able to finish off Lugia and Giratina-O. U-turn prevents Landorus-T from giving free turns to opposing teams, eases prediction, and allows it to function better as a pivot. Explosion is a great last-ditch method of dealing damage while maintaining momentum and preventing the foe from being able to use Defog. Superpower can be used to hit threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Ferrothorn, and Darkrai harder than Earthquake, but it is typically a poor move to be locked into.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature are used to make Landorus-T hit as hard as possible and always 2HKO standard defensive Primal Groudon. 252 Speed EVs give Landorus-T the raw Speed for the Choice Scarf to boost, granting it the ability to outspeed Mega Mewtwo Y and everything up to Choice Scarf base 90 Speed Pokemon that don't run a Speed-boosting nature. A Choice Scarf gives Landorus-T the ability to revenge kill a variety of foes it would otherwise get outsped by, such as Darkrai, Mega Gengar, Xerneas, Mewtwo, and Arceus formes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The combination of Intimidate and U-turn allows Landorus-T to function as a pivot; however, because Landorus-T has no instant or passive recovery, it can only be used a few times as such. This set is somewhat unexpected for opponents, so spamming fast U-turns early in the game is a good way to give away the set. You should play minimally until a situation arises where the opponent intends to stay in thinking they will move first; this is how you can surprise them. Even though Earthquake has many targets in the Ubers tier, virtually all teams pack one or several Ground-immune Pokemon. In the situation of an eventual switch into a Ground-immune target by your opponent, you will want to use U-turn or, alternatively, Stone Edge, if their Ground-immune Pokemon can be taken down by it. Make sure your team can accommodate giving the opponent a free turn with a Ground-immune Pokemon before deciding to revenge kill with Earthquake. If you cannot, do not lock into Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Darkrai is an effective teammate that can be easier to get into play due to Landorus-T's U-turn. Furthermore, it is great at threatening stall, a playstyle that this set is unable to break on its own. Xerneas benefits from the offensive check to Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh that Landorus-T provides. Mega Gengar, like Darkrai, is easier to get into play thanks to U-turn and is able to threaten several of the bulky Pokemon that wall this set. Arceus-Ghost alongside Landorus-T can provide a sufficient offensive check to Extreme Killer Arceus while Arceus-Ghost benefits from the additional check to Ho-Oh. Arceus-Dark can function as a stallbreaker and threaten Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Lugia, which annoy Landorus-T. Primal Kyogre can further lay on the pressure against Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh while also being able to blast through threats that specialize in physical bulk. Yveltal can threaten Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Lugia effectively, three big threats for Landorus-T. Arceus-Rock handles Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence and appreciates Landorus-T's Ground immunity.</p>"

  "Kyurem-White": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyurem-W is a terrifying wallbreaker in the Ubers metagame, possessing a sky-high base 170 Special Attack, a rather nice offensive typing, and a decent Speed tier that allows it to outrun quite a bit of the slower metagame. However, while it is generally good, its Speed tier leaves it outsped by quite a few Pokemon, and while its typing is good offensively, it provides little defensive benefit, making it hard to fit Kyurem-W on a team. Kyurem-W's strong STAB Draco Meteor is not as spammable as it was in previous generations due to the introduction of strong Fairy-type Pokemon, such as Xerneas. Another weak point is that after Kyurem-W hits something with Draco Meteor, it can end up being setup fodder for a lot of Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be chosen on the Life Orb Attacker set, but the residual damage from Life Orb and Substitute in conjunction with a horrible defensive typing and a Stealth Rock weakness might cause Kyurem-W to be worn down very quickly. Toxic is an option to wear down bulky Arceus formes that Kyurem-W can't break past otherwise. If Ho-Oh is a threat, you can run Stone Edge on the Life Orb set; this will OHKO Ho-Oh even with an Attack-decreasing nature and give Kyurem-W a way to get past Blissey. A set containing Substitute and Roost is also a possibility to pressure stall, but giving up important coverage moves hurts Kyurem-W a lot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: The presence of Fairy-type Pokemon such as Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, and Mega Diancie prevents Kyurem-W from safely spamming Draco Meteor, as they are immune to it. However, only a Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy can switch into Kyurem-W safely.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Many strong Pokemon that are faster than Kyurem-W are very good checks to it, but none of them can switch in safely. Examples of these threats include Mega Mewtwo X and Y, Xerneas, Latios, Latias, Deoxys-A, Blaziken, and Darkrai.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: While Blissey might be KOed by two Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blasts after Stealth Rock damage, it is unreliable, and Blissey can avoid being KOed if it has Protect and Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Defensive variants of Primal Kyogre can take any hit and proceed to stall out Kyurem-W, phaze it, and cripple it with status, but it is worn down rather easily if it is not running Rest. Primal Kyogre can be defeated if you keep Spikes and Stealth Rock set up.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Although Ho-Oh is threatened by Stealth Rock, it poses a problem if it can switch in unscathed due to its excellent bulk and the fact that none of Kyurem-W's moves can hit it for super effective damage. Keep a Stealth Rock setter such as Primal Groudon on your team if you do not carry an answer to Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Arceus Formes</strong>: Calm Mind Arceus formes can set up Calm Mind and avoid being 2HKOed if Kyurem-W does not have a super effective move. Be careful with using Draco Meteor, as that could turn Kyurem-W into setup fodder for them; however, only specially defensive variants can switch into Ice Beam and set up.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Kyurem-W is weak to Stealth Rock; it takes away a lot of its health and leaves Kyurem-W prone to being revenge killed. Try not to switch Kyurem-W into Stealth Rock if it lacks Roost, especially with Life Orb equipped.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types can take a Draco Meteor and Ice Beam and retaliate with their STAB moves. They have to be careful of Kyurem-W's coverage moves, though; Focus Blast can dispatch of Arceus-Steel and Dialga rather well, while Fusion Flare can melt Genesect, Scizor, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Mega Metagross.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam hits the majority of the tier at least neutrally and is able to 2HKO many Pokemon. Draco Meteor is used to destroy about anything in the tier once truly sturdy special walls and all Pokemon that resist or are immune to Dragon have been removed. Fusion Flare hits Steel-types such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Genesect, Aegislash, and Bronzong for good damage. Focus Blast gets past Normal, Steel, and Arceus-Rock as well as Blissey and Shuca Berry Dialga. Earth Power is another option to hit Diancie and Primal Groudon hard while still dealing super effective damage to Dialga, though you have to be careful of Shuca Berry variants. Sleep Talk is used to act as a sleep absorber.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and Choice Specs grant Kyurem-W the power to break through nearly anything with the proper move. A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment give Kyurem-W the ability to Speed tie other positive-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon and outspeed neutral-natured Xerneas, Rayquaza, Yveltal, and opposing Kyurem-W. The remaining 4 EVs are placed into Special Defense rather than HP so that Kyurem-W can switch into Stealth Rock four times. A Modest nature can be used to further amplify Kyurem-W's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Try bringing Kyurem-W in as often as possible during the early stages of the game and spam the appropriate coverage move. However, you should only lock Kyurem-W into Draco Meteor if you have removed all opposing Fairy- and Steel-types or if you have a dedicated answer to Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy. Usually, Kyurem-W should spam Ice Beam, as it wears down even very bulky Pokemon that resist it, such as Primal Kyogre, really well, and it does so even better with Stealth Rock support. Keeping Stealth Rock set up on the opponent's side at all times is really useful, as it allows Choice Specs Kyurem-W to KO even the bulkiest of Pokemon in, at worst, two hits. You should be careful about letting Kyurem-W take damage, though getting poisoned or burned is not the end of the line, as Kyurem-W will rarely stay in more than two turns. Try to remove Stealth Rock from your own side of the field, as it will take away a chunk of Kyurem-W's health each time it switches in. Be especially careful if your opponent has an Arceus forme and has not yet revealed its type. It can help you out a lot to scout for an enemy Arceus forme, as Calm Mind Arceus is a very solid check to a Choice-locked Kyurem-W because Kyurem-W is unable to 2HKO after Arceus has one Calm Mind boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is one of the best partners for Kyurem-W because it can set up Stealth Rock, spread paralysis, take on Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas, and phaze foes while racking up Stealth Rock damage, helping Kyurem-W achieve OHKOs more easily. Geomancy Xerneas is also a very good partner, as Kyurem-W can either dispatch of or wear down Xerneas's checks. Phazing in general is greatly appreciated, so defensive variants of Primal Groudon, Dialga, and Primal Kyogre are fine choices for teammates. Furthermore, a teammate that can clean up after Kyurem-W is rather useful, such as Deoxys-A or Extreme Killer Arceus. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Yveltal, Mega Scizor, and Zekrom can be great assets to get Kyurem-W in safely as often as possible. Additionally, a Pokemon that can deal with Ho-Oh is appreciated. Arceus-Rock can work nicely, but other Pokemon with Rock- or Electric-type moves such as Zekrom and Blaziken can handle Ho-Oh well enough. An answer to Extreme Killer Arceus is important, making physically defensive Yveltal a good choice. Finally, entry hazard removal would be ideal, with Rapid Spin being preferred as to not remove Stealth Rock from the opponent's side. However, because the only viable spinners in Ubers are Excadrill and Forretress, you are usually better off using a Defogger such as Latios, Latias, Giratina-O, or a support Arceus forme of any type (though Fairy and Steel tend to pair well with Kyurem-W).</p>"

      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is a reliable STAB attack and is the move that Kyurem-W should be using most of the time. Draco Meteor deals massive damage, but the Special Attack drop forces Kyurem-W out. Fusion Flare hits Steel-types such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Genesect, and Arceus-Steel. Roost allows Kyurem-W to mitigate damage from switching into Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil. Another option would be Earth Power, which can be used for hitting Dialga (though you have to be careful of Shuca Berry variants, which can survive and easily OHKO back), Primal Groudon, Diancie, and Jirachi. Focus Blast is another option, but it is generally inferior because the only really notable thing you cannot hit without it is Dialga. However, with Focus Blast, Kyurem-W doesn't have to worry about Dialga carrying a Shuca Berry.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe is used to give Kyurem-W the ability to Speed tie other positive-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon, outspeed neutral-natured Xerneas, Yveltal, Rayquaza, and other Kyurem-W, and switch into Stealth Rock four times. You can go for a Modest nature, which slightly boosts Kyurem-W's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kyurem-W is generally best off spamming Ice Beam while using its coverage moves accordingly. Only use Draco Meteor if you want to weaken an important check on your opponent's team or if you want to finish off a Pokemon that Kyurem-W can't KO with any other move. Also try keeping up entry hazards as long as possible, as Kyurem-W forces many switches. It is advisable to avoid status ailments, as they will wear down Kyurem-W faster in tandem with taking Life Orb recoil. Be wary of any Arceus on the opposing team, as Life Orb Kyurem-W cannot OHKO a 252 HP Arceus on the switch with Draco Meteor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Primal Groudon is Kyurem-W's best friend, as with Life Orb Kyurem-W has absolutely no way to break past Calm Mind Arceus formes and Arceus-Fairy without hax. Entry hazards are much appreciated because Kyurem-W forces many switches. Geomancy Xerneas is a very good partner, as Kyurem-W can dispatch every Xerneas check with its coverage moves. Calm Mind Arceus formes are even more threatening to Life Orb Kyurem-W, so Primal Groudon, Dialga, and Primal Kyogre are very valuable partners. Additionally, stallbreakers such as Yveltal and Mega Gengar are appreciated to get around Blissey or some Calm Mind Arceus formes, especially because with a Life Orb, Kyurem-W has no way to get past Blissey. A Defogger such as Latias, Latios, Giratina-O, or a Defog Arceus of any type (though Fairy and Steel tend to pair well with Kyurem-W) is useful. Arceus-Rock or any Pokemon with Rock- or Electric-type moves such as Zekrom or Blaziken can check Ho-Oh. Lastly, physically defensive Yveltal can act as an answer to Extreme Killer Arceus.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is Kyurem-W's spammable STAB move that will be its primary way of dealing damage. Draco Meteor acts as Kyurem-W's nuke, though it is rather risky to use with a Choice Scarf. Earth Power rounds out Kyurem-W's coverage and give it a way to revenge kill Mega Diancie, Choice Scarf Zekrom, and Dialga; it also hits Primal Groudon harder than Ice Beam. Fusion Flare is used to dispatch Ferrothorn, Aegislash, Jirachi, and Scizor, while Sleep Talk is a fine option to be able to absorb Dark Voids from Darkrai.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature with an EV spread 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe is used to allow Kyurem-W to Speed tie other neutral-natured Choice Scarf Kyurem-W and to provide it with enough power to plow through teams. Kyurem-W will also be able to switch into Stealth Rock four times with these EVs. Using a Timid nature will allow Kyurem-W to to Speed tie with other positive-natured base 95 Speed Pokemon, Xerneas, and Yveltal, but the loss in power can be a hassle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rather than wallbreaking for its team, Choice Scarf Kyurem-W works as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer. Be very careful when attacking, as Kyurem-W can be easily taken advantage of when locked into a suboptimal move. It is highly beneficial to keep entry hazards up at all times due to Kyurem-W forcing a lot of switches. Having Stealth Rock off your side of the field is of major importance to allow Kyurem-W to switch in and out a lot. Also, try to preserve Kyurem-W until late-game and only come in to revenge kill, but only do this if its sweep won't get cut short by priority, such as Extreme Speed from Arceus.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Kyurem-W and Primal Groudon complement each other extremely nicely; Primal Groudon appreciates Kyurem-W's ability to revenge kill Arceus-Ground, and Kyurem-W likes to have Stealth Rock support and a safe answer for Geomancy Xerneas. Entry hazards are much appreciated because Kyurem-W forces many switches, so Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Dialga make for good partners. Phazing can help to wear down enemy teams before Kyurem-W attempts to sweep, so Primal Groudon, Dialga, and Primal Kyogre can be valuable partners. Stallbreakers such as Yveltal or Mega Gengar take care of Blissey and other bulky very Pokemon that Kyurem-W lacks coverage moves for. Entry hazard removal would be ideal, preferably in the form of Rapid Spin; however, only Excadrill and Forretress can do this, so you are usually better off using a Defogger such as Latios, Latias, Giratina-O, or a Defog Arceus of any type (though Fairy and Steel tend to pair well with Kyurem-W). A Ho-Oh check such as Arceus-Rock or any Pokemon with Rock- or Electric-type moves, such as Landorus-T, Blaziken, or Zekrom, is important because Ho-Oh can cut Kyurem-W's sweep short. An answer to Extreme Killer, such as physically defensive Yveltal, is also important.</p>"

  "Genesect": {
    "overview": "<p>Genesect is an effective momentum gainer and revenge killer in the Ubers metagame. This is because, when coupled with Download, Genesect's U-turn hits extremely hard, allowing it to keep offensive pressure up and gain momentum at the same time. Download also gives most of Genesect's moves more of an edge. Genesect is also useful for its ability to revenge kill both Latios and Latias with relative ease, which is almost invaluable for offensive teams. Latios and Latias's popularity also harms Genesect in a way, as the ease of Defog support weakens one of its niches as a solid team member on Sticky Web archetypes. Genesect has severe problems with Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, two very prevalent Pokemon in the metagame, hindering its effectiveness. Furthermore, the slow, bulky metagame means that Genesect has a somewhat harder time denting threats with U-turn, but the decrease in Choice Scarf users gives Genesect a more defined niche as a revenge killer.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Genesect's movepool allows it to run multiple moves and sets. A Choice Band set capitalizes on Download and strong U-turns or Explosion to dent bulkier threats, including most of Genesect's checks, but loses the opportunity of revenge killing most of the tier outside of Extreme Speed. Shift Gear can also be used to let Genesect clean up most teams while hitting hard, but it limits Genesect's offensive utility, needs more support due to Genesect's poor bulk, and locks it into a Hasty nature, leaving it vulnerable to priority. Bug Buzz is Genesect's only option for a special Bug-type STAB move, but it pales in usefulness to U-turn and can be punished easily if Genesect is locked into it via a Choice item. Flamethrower is an option over Blaze Kick if physically defensive Steel-types prove to be more of a problem on the team Genesect is on. Thunder can 2HKO Ho-Oh after a Download boost and has utility against Primal Kyogre, but Genesect becomes even more vulnerable to Primal Groudon as a result. Magic Coat can be useful on Genesect to keep burns and paralysis away from it, as well as being efficient against dedicated hyper offense leads in order to shut them down almost completely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Bulky Fire-types such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are the biggest threats to Genesect, as they soak up even Download-boosted U-turns along with most of Genesect's coverage moves and are able to threaten it massively with a 4x super effective STAB move. Provided Stealth Rock is not up, Ho-Oh can repeatedly threaten Genesect thanks to Regenerator and Sacred Fire.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Dialga, Aegislash, and Skarmory can switch into a vast majority of Genesect's coverage options and either set up entry hazards on it or wear it down with attacks. Aegislash in particular can punish most of Genesect's Choice-locked attacks with King's Shield.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Genesect is only immune to Toxic Spikes and takes normal damage from all other entry hazards, so its health is whittled down considerably every time it comes in, even to the point where Genesect itself can be revenge killed by priority attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Pokemon that can soak up Genesect's U-turn and fire off extremely powerful attacks can threaten both Genesect and its team; offensively oriented Pokemon such as Kyogre, Dialga, and Primal Groudon accurately represent this trait.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Though it is immune to Toxic, Genesect is extremely vulnerable to both burn and paralysis, so a stray Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave can hinder Genesect's effectiveness to the point of being near-dead weight.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>A strong U-turn is one of Genesect's defining traits, being able to apply offensive pressure and gain momentum at the same time. Iron Head serves as Genesect's secondary STAB option, being able to revenge kill Mega Diancie and some Xerneas variants. Ice Beam is the primary method for Genesect to do damage to Primal Groudon (after a Download boost); it is also able to revenge kill a boosted Rayquaza and is a nice option against other Ground-types and Dragon-types. Explosion has immense utility on most teams, as Genesect can do massive damage to threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Ho-Oh, especially with a Download boost, and it prevents any entry hazard removal moves from occurring. If the team requires some form of priority, Extreme Speed is very useful against Geomancy Xerneas and other sweepers that are naturally faster than Genesect, and it can have slight cleaning potential after a Download boost. Blaze Kick can be opted for if Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Klefki present a problem for the team, but it has the drawback of making Genesect become massive Primal Groudon bait if Ice Beam is removed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature is preferred on Genesect in order to sponge priority attacks better, but Hasty is required on sets with Extreme Speed or Blaze Kick due to legality issues. The above spread allows Genesect to hit hard physically with U-turn while giving its Special Attack an extra point after a Download boost. If you want more offense or bulk on Genesect, a spread of either 252 Atk / 72 SpA / 184 Spe or 72 HP / 248 Atk / 8 SpA / 184 Spe with a Hasty or Naive nature can outspeed all Choice Scarf base 90 Speed Pokemon while having the option of hitting harder with Ice Beam or taking hits from priority such as Extreme Speed better.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to the relative freedom of being able to spam U-turn, this is usually a player's go-to option in favorable matchups or against one of Genesect's checks and counters, so try to utilize as much momentum as possible and think smart when switching to specific Pokemon. Though Genesect does have coverage options, it is primarily a revenge killer, so either pick off threats with the appropriate coverage move or U-turn to a different Pokemon to capitalize on momentum. Genesect can also function well as a lead against specific Pokemon, as U-turn can hurt some leads well enough to limit them to one layer of entry hazards by letting Genesect switch to a Pokemon that can revenge kill it with priority or a coverage move. Using Genesect as a Geomancy Xerneas switch-in is not recommended due to Genesect's subpar bulk, so be careful against those variants unless it either has not boosted or is at low enough HP for Genesect to pick it off with a Download-boosted Extreme Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is very useful for Genesect to utilize offensive pressure with U-turn, so entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, Klefki, Dialga, and Forretress are very solid teammates. Offensive users of Rapid Spin or Defog such as Forretress, Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O can also assist Genesect by minimizing the residual damage it takes from entry hazards. Zekrom forms a very solid VoltTurn core with Genesect and is able to soft check Ho-Oh, though you should be wary of Primal Groudon when using this core. Wallbreakers and sweepers love having the multiple opportunities to switch in that Genesect can provide, so pairing Genesect with offensive threats such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Xerneas, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza is extremely beneficial. Despite the archetype being somewhat inefficient due to the prevalence in entry hazard removal, Genesect functions well in Sticky Web teams, as it can pressure Latios and Latias while keeping hazards up with Explosion, so setters of Sticky Web such as Smeargle can work great with Genesect.</p>"

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<p>Klefki has a great typing and decent bulk that allows it to check a variety of threats in Ubers, such as Xerneas, Darkrai, Yveltal, Latias, and Latios. Its ability Prankster is exceptional in conjunction with Thunder Wave, letting Klefki act as a safety net to check fast sweepers and attackers, such as Geomancy Xerneas, Mega Salamence, and Mewtwo; its ability to check a wide range of Pokemon makes it a good choice for role compression in teambuilding. Klefki also has access to Toxic, which can pressure Defog users and wear down Primal Groudon, and Spikes, which it can set up reliably because it has Toxic to put a timer on Defog users and can check many common Pokemon. Unfortunately, Primal Groudon's overbearing presence in the metagame greatly hinders Klefki's ability to function, as its immunity to Thunder Wave deters Klefki from freely using the move; Ho-Oh's presence is also a problem, as it can switch in easily and hit Klefki and its teammates hard while possibly spreading burns as well. Klefki also has exploitable weaknesses to common Ground- and Fire-type coverage moves, and it lacks reliable recovery, so it can be worn down throughout the match.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Klefki can use Flash Cannon instead of Play Rough, which allows it to hit Mega Diancie 4x super effectively while still dealing respectable damage to Xerneas. Foul Play can also be used, as it is Klefki's only way to deal respectable damage to Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh with an attack. Klefki has access to both Reflect and Light Screen as support moves, and it can set up one or both of these to ease setup for teammates or to temporarily increase its own longevity. Heal Block prevents Arceus formes, Latias, and Latios from using Recover or Roost. Finally, Magnet Rise gives Klefki an immunity to Ground, which makes it a more effective check to Ground-type coverage users like Mega Salamence and Rayquaza.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are the best checks to Klefki, as they are immune to Thunder Wave, do not take much from Play Rough, and are able to threaten Klefki with a super effective STAB move. Primal Groudon is the best of these, as it is resistant to Play Rough and can switch in and set Stealth Rock or target Klefki with either of its STAB moves; however, it can be worn down by Spikes and Toxic. Arceus-Ground also switches in easily, and it can proceed to set up with Swords Dance or Calm Mind, Recover off any damage, or hit Klefki with Earthquake or Judgment while only fearing Toxic in return. Excadrill is a very good counter, as it is immune to both Thunder Wave and Toxic and can retaliate with Earthquake or use Rapid Spin to clear Spikes. Landorus-T can switch in, though it dislikes Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types work similarly to Ground-types in that they can switch in and threaten Klefki with a STAB move. Ho-Oh is a Fire-type counter that is immune to Spikes and can force Klefki out while spreading burns with Sacred Fire, though it doesn't appreciate either status move Klefki has.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye bounce back Spikes and status with Magic Bounce. The former can beat Klefki with Earth Power or simply hit it repeatedly while only fearing the rare Flash Cannon, while the latter is not 2HKOed by Play Rough and can use Recover to stay healthy while slowly hurting Klefki with burn damage from Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: By virtue of typing, Steel-types are good checks to Klefki because they are immune to Klefki's main way of dealing damage, which is Toxic. Dialga can set up Stealth Rock against Klefki and also hit it with a super effective Fire Blast. Mega Scizor can wear down Klefki with repeated hits or set up with Swords Dance. Ferrothorn can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes and can slowly drain Klefki's HP with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar traps Klefki and can remove it so that another teammate can sweep, though it dislikes Thunder Wave and Klefki is able to set multiple layers of Spikes before it is KOed by Mega Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre</strong>: Kyogre can beat Klefki by switching in and threatening it with a powerful rain-boosted STAB Origin Pulse or Scald; however, it doesn't enjoy being hit by Thunder Wave or Toxic, and it can be worn down by Spikes if it lacks Rest.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes is an important asset for Klefki, as it punishes opposing switches and wears down bulky Pokemon for Klefki's teammates. Thunder Wave checks and cripples fast threats such as Xerneas and Mega Salamence. Play Rough deals respectable damage against some Dark- and Dragon-types while circumventing Taunt; it also breaks Xerneas's Substitutes so that Xerneas can be paralyzed. Toxic annoys Primal Groudon, Kyogre, Ho-Oh, almost all Arceus formes, Giratina-O, Latias, and Latios.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize mixed bulk, while 252 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature best take on special attackers, such as Xerneas, Yveltal, and various Arceus formes. 8 Attack EVs provide a minimal amount of additional power, though it can have a slight effect against certain bulky Substitute Geomancy Xerneas sets. Leftovers provides residual healing and is the only means of recovery that Klefki has access to.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is important to preserve Klefki if the opponent has a potentially threatening sweeper in reserve, as letting Klefki take too much damage early-game could make it unable to paralyze a potential sweeper. Use Klefki's many resistances to switch in on Pokemon that it checks, such as Xerneas, Yveltal, Latias, and Latios; the resulting free turn should be used to set Spikes up or Toxic an incoming Primal Groudon. If Klefki is not too important in a given matchup, it may be effective to sacrifice Klefki, or much of its HP, to get off a crippling Thunder Wave on a potential threat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is a good partner for Klefki, as it sets Stealth Rock and also blanket checks a wide range of Pokemon, such as Kyogre, Steel-types, and Xerneas, the last of which is collaboratively checked by the pairing of Primal Groudon and Klefki. Latias and Latios both check Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre for Klefki while also benefiting from Klefki's Spikes, especially if they are Calm Mind variants. In general, offensive Pokemon that enjoy Spikes support and can prevent Defog through offensive pressure, such as Swords Dance Arceus, Xerneas, Mewtwo, Primal Groudon, Darkrai, and Mega Salamence, make for good teammates.</p>"

  "Xerneas": {
    "overview": "<p>The most powerful and versatile Fairy-type available, Xerneas is capable of pulling off a variety of tricks and is able to do them well. The Geomancy set shapes the metagame around it, being one of the most dangerous albeit prepared-for sets in the tier. Although Xerneas's raw stats aren't particularly impressive in a single aspect, its defensive stats are solid and backed up by an above average HP stat, and its base 99 Speed allows Xerneas to outspeed several relevant threats in the Ubers tier. While base 131 Special Attack is good, it's not particularly high without a Special Attack boost or a Life Orb, as many other threats in the Ubers tier such as Mewtwo and Kyogre have higher raw offenses and Xerneas's coverage moves aren't boosted by Fairy Aura. Xerneas's ability functions as a buffed Life Orb for Moonblast without forfeiting the item slot or taking recoil, making offensive sets more potent and allowing defensive sets to hit hard without investment. Mono-Fairy typing is good defensively, granting only a few weaknesses along with a handy immunity to the Dragon type. Xerneas is capable of running many coverage moves, although most of these are either weak or have an accuracy drawback. It does have some good support moves such as Aromatherapy and Roar, but the lack of instant recovery means it has to run Rest on a defensive set. Furthermore, Xerneas is afflicted by all entry hazards and by all nonvolatile status, somewhat reducing its defensive synergy. Some Xerneas sets are vulnerable to Shadow Tag Mega Gengar, and Xerneas is impacted by the fact that the most common Pokemon in the tier, Primal Groudon, resists Moonblast.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Megahorn on Choice Scarf Xerneas provides slightly higher damage on Mega Mewtwo Y and can be pulled from Sleep Talk to KO Darkrai, but it has little other use. A Pixie Plate on an offensive set is an option that makes Moonblast almost as strong as when boosted by a Life Orb and is very good at bluffing a Geomancy or Choice Scarf set, but opting for Pixie Plate means that coverage options deal less damage. Ingrain protects Xerneas from being phazed and helps alleviate residual damage. Thunder Wave can be used to punish switch-ins that aren't Primal Groudon and greatly impacts a variety of offensive threats, but it doesn't do much to defensive switch-ins. Toxic is usable on a defensive set to hit incoming Primal Groudon, Lugia, and Ho-Oh, although it can be a difficult move to fit. Block can be used in tandem with Rest on a Geomancy set to trap Klefki and allows Xerneas to remove paralysis and set up to +6, although such a set forgoes running coverage moves and isn't always useful in a match. Similarly, a RestTalk Geomancy set can be used along with a bulkier spread in order to break down teams that rely on methods of beating down or revenge killing Xerneas. Misty Terrain can be used to block status moves aimed at Xerneas and is particularly effective against Klefki. Flash Cannon might seem like an appealing move to hit other Fairy-types; however, because neutral Moonblast deals more damage than super effective Flash Cannon, it is nearly always useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Although Primal Groudon is not the best defensive Xerneas check, it is certainly the most common and is frequently EVed in response to Geomancy Xerneas. Primal Groudon resists Xerneas's STAB attack, is bulky enough to survive any of its +2 coverage moves at full health, and can retaliate with powerful physical Ground moves, Thunder Wave, or Roar.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh resists Xerneas's STAB attack and has massive special bulk. Frequently Ho-Oh is EVed to survive +2 Xerneas's Thunder, and it has powerful physical moves such as Sacred Fire and Brave Bird to hit back. Regenerator and Roost make it virtually impossible for Choice Scarf Xerneas to beat down Ho-Oh with Moonblast, while defensive sets take far more from Ho-Oh's attacks than they can deal back.</p> <p><strong>Klefki</strong>: With priority Thunder Wave and a resistance to Moonblast, Klefki can switch into Geomancy Xerneas and cripple it with Thunder Wave. The Choice Scarf and Life Orb sets also fear Thunder Wave, although Life Orb Close Combat can beat down Klefki switch-ins. Against defensive sets Klefki can set up Spikes, although Calm Mind Xerneas can set up on Klefki.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: With Shadow Tag, a resistance to Moonblast, and a powerful super effective STAB attack, Mega Gengar is a nightmare for defensive Xerneas sets. It can also check offensive sets if at full health, although Geomancy Xerneas goes right through it if already set up.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Although Lugia doesn't resist Moonblast, Multiscale in combination with its excellent special bulk means that it can phaze Geomancy Xerneas if at full health and without Stealth Rock in play. It can Toxic stall the Choice Scarf and Life Orb sets in certain scenarios, and the Calm Mind set can be phazed.</p> <p><strong>Certain Steel-types</strong>: Aegislash, Excadrill, Genesect, Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, Mega Lucario, and Arceus-Steel all pose a general danger for Xerneas sets. Aegislash can defensively check Xerneas sets that aren't Calm Mind, Excadrill can outspeed even offensive Xerneas sets in sand and pound them with Iron Head. Genesect outspeeds all Xerneas sets, excluding a boosted Geomancy Xerneas, and hits hard with Iron Head. Ferrothorn fears Fighting-type coverage moves from offensive threats, but it can hit hard with Gyro Ball and attempt to stall out Xerneas with Leech Seed and/or Toxic. Jirachi is bulky enough to survive any of +2 Xerneas's attacks and can cripple it with Thunder Wave, while Choice Scarf variants can use a fast Iron Head. Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Mega Lucario can all revenge kill Geomancy Xerneas with Bullet Punch and break down defensive sets with strong Steel-type STAB attacks. Lastly, Arceus-Steel can nail sets with a powerful super effective Judgment, although it fears Fighting-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: For offensive teams, priority moves are an effective way of disposing of Geomancy and Choice Scarf Xerneas. This includes Extreme Speed, Bullet Punch, Fake Out, Shadow Sneak, and even Sucker Punch if Xerneas has been weakened enough.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey has the sheer special bulk to take even +2 Xerneas's attacks, and it can attempt to whittle down Xerneas with Toxic. Blissey stalemates with the support set, but it does fear Close Combat from the Life Orb set.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fire</strong>: Both Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fire resist Xerneas's STAB attack and have the bulk to take any coverage move, even if Xerneas is at +2. In return, both Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fire can retaliate with Thunder Wave or set up Calm Mind.</p>",

      "Geomancy": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Geomancy turns Xerneas into a fast, powerful, and specially bulky setup sweeper at the cost of the item slot. Moonblast is the best Fairy-type move available to Xerneas and, when combined with the +2 Special Attack boost from Geomancy, STAB, and Fairy Aura, allows Xerneas to hit very hard. Thunder hits Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Lugia, and most Steel-types. Thunder is always used over Thunderbolt because a super effective Thunderbolt is weaker than a Fairy Aura-boosted STAB Moonblast and thus not worth running. Aromatherapy is an alternate option to Thunder that trades hitting the aforementioned threats for the ability to support teammates in a pinch or remove status from Xerneas. Focus Blast rounds out Xerneas's coverage by hitting Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, and some other Steel-types. Hidden Power Ground is an alternate, perfectly accurate coverage move that hits Primal Groudon just as hard as Focus Blast and hits Steel-types such as Klefki harder than Moonblast at the cost of not being able to hit Ferrothorn and a few threats such as Arceus-Steel as hard as Focus Blast.</p> <p>Hidden Power Rock hits Ho-Oh harder and more reliably than Thunder at the cost of missing out on hitting Primal Kyogre. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferrothorn just as hard as Focus Blast without accuracy issues while it also hits Mega Scizor very well and still handles Steel-types in general. Substitute is an option that allows Xerneas to avoid being hit with status. This is particularly useful against Pokemon that rely on Thunder Wave to halt a Xerneas sweep, as Xerneas can set up a Substitute on the turn the foe uses Thunder Wave or as Klefki comes in. It is also an effective move against some defensive Pokemon such as Aegislash and Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment ensures that Xerneas hits as hard as possible once boosted so that it can effectively sweep; the most prominent benchmark is a guaranteed OHKO on maximum HP Arceus formes after Stealth Rock. 44 Speed EVs are used so that Xerneas is faster than Choice Scarf Genesect after a Geomancy boost. 28 Defense EVs give Genesect a Special Attack boost with Download and, when combined with the 184 HP EVs, they allow Xerneas to always survive a +2 standard Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock. A spread of 56 HP / 156 Def / 252 SpA / 44 Spe with a Modest nature can always survive +1 Adamant Mega Salamence's Return and gives Xerneas more physical bulk in general; however, it's 2HKOed by Life Orb Yveltal's Oblivion Wing much more often. A Power Herb allows Xerneas to set up Geomancy in a single turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unlike other setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Salamence and Extreme Killer Arceus, Geomancy Xerneas can only set up once because a Power Herb is a single-use item. This makes choosing when to set up perhaps the most important aspect of using Geomancy Xerneas. Usually it is not a good idea to set up when the opponent still has healthy Xerneas checks, because this gives up your one opportunity to sweep for little to gain. There are exceptions, however; Xerneas can set up in order to tear down a Pokemon such as Primal Groudon to pave a way for another Pokemon to sweep or can be used to force a trade with a troublesome Pokemon such as Klefki. In general, though, it is best not to set up Geomancy Xerneas until its checks have been eliminated or, more realistically, damaged enough to be blown past. The methods in which an offensive team checks Geomancy Xerneas are usually a different beast entirely. Such teams usually focus on a combination of damaging Xerneas on its setup turn along with the employment of a revenge killer such as Extreme Killer Arceus. Unlike defensive checks, offensive checks cannot be blown past in the same way; it is irrelevant how damaged the opponent's Extreme Killer Arceus or Mega Scizor is because they have priority over Xerneas. This means that unless you benefit from the trade that will occur by setting up Xerneas while a revenge killer is alive, it is best not to set up or, in a rare scenario, attempt to set up in a situation where you won't be damaged on the setup turn so much that you can be revenge killed.</p> <p>In both cases of knowing when to set up, you must be acquainted with what amount of damage Geomancy Xerneas is capable of taking and dealing. If the opponent has a Rayquaza with Extreme Speed in the back, determine how much you can afford to let Xerneas take when setting up. Similarly, know how much you need to have chipped away at the opposing Lugia before you are ready to sweep. Many teams use Primal Groudon as a check to Geomancy Xerneas, and this can be capitalized upon due to its lack of recovery. Rather than setting up Xerneas right away when a Primal Groudon switch-in is obvious, smack it with Moonblast as it comes in. Switch out, and repeat this the next time you can get Xerneas in for free; after taking two Moonblasts, even specially defensive Primal Groudon can be broken after setting up. Note that Geomancy Xerneas doesn't really want to switch into anything because it is most deadly as a sweeper when at full health. This set can afford to switch into offensive Yveltal; however, Oblivion Wing deals significant damage. Xerneas can be aggressively double switched with in order to break down its checks via offensive partners that perform well against said checks. Because Geomancy Xerneas is good at forcing switches, especially against defensive teams, this provides opportunities to bring in other offensive threats that can start blowing holes in the opposing defensive build. Xerneas has an immunity to Dragon-type moves, and although they are not extremely common, bringing Xerneas in on a predicted Draco Meteor is one of the better methods of getting it into play. In some matchups, a Geomancy Xerneas sweep will be difficult or not worth it; in such scenarios Xerneas can be used more as a team player to aggressively pivot against Pokemon such as Yveltal and Giratina-O.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is able to threaten virtually every Xerneas check that isn't Lugia, making it an excellent offensive partner for Geomancy Xerneas. Extreme Killer Arceus is a setup sweeper that pairs well with Geomancy Xerneas for offensive teams due to how they pressure similar checks. Arceus-Ghost is a great partner, as Xerneas can threaten Yveltal while Arceus-Ghost is immune to Extreme Speed and can break down several Xerneas checks with Will-O-Wisp or Judgment. Mega Salamence provides a method of threatening Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, which are two of the most common checks to Geomancy Xerneas, and it also performs well against Extreme Killer Arceus; Refresh variants can also provide an excellent switch-in to Sacred Fire from Ho-Oh. Mega Gengar can be used to trap and eliminate several checks to Geomancy Xerneas or force them to trade with Destiny Bond, making it much easier for Xerneas to sweep later on. Arceus-Ground plows through almost all defensive Xerneas checks and provides an immunity to Thunder Wave. Darkrai can pressure the defensive backbone of an opposing team, as it is a very difficult Pokemon to switch into, making it easier for Xerneas to break down the foe. Mewtwo formes greatly appreciate Xerneas's ability to check Yveltal and in return can stallbreak against defensive builds that Xerneas may struggle with. Life Orb Zekrom effectively pressures Ho-Oh and can beat down Klefki and Primal Groudon with Bolt Strike and Draco Meteor, respectively. Giratina-O appreciates Xerneas checking Yveltal, can perform well against Primal Groudon, and offers an immunity to Fake Out and Extreme Speed. Lastly, setters of entry hazards make ensuring a Geomancy Xerneas sweep much easier, as Stealth Rock can ensure the KO on Lugia and Ho-Oh while Spikes can break down Primal Groudon and Steel-types.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is the primary attacking move for this set, as it's not a particularly bad move to be locked into and is the strongest move available for Choice Scarf Xerneas. It also has a good chance at lowering the foe's Special Attack one stage, which can be handy against special attackers that switch into Choice Scarf Xerneas. Focus Blast can hit most targets that resist Moonblast, such as Primal Groudon and Steel-types not named Aegislash. Sleep Talk allows Xerneas to directly switch into Darkrai's Dark Void and potentially knock it out before it can attack again. It also sees use against the rare Spore Smeargle. Aromatherapy allows Xerneas to provide emergency cleric support for its teammates. Thunder allows Xerneas to hit Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Lugia a bit harder. Grass Knot can hit Primal Groudon just as hard as Focus Blast without the risk of a miss while also hitting Primal Kyogre and a few other threats such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Rock, and Arceus-Water. It is possible to only run the moves Sleep Talk and Moonblast as to function as a more consistent Darkrai check at the cost of relinquishing coverage moves. Rock Slide hits Ho-Oh much harder than Thunder, but it doesn't hit anything else.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature are used to maximize the damage output of Moonblast, better allowing Xerneas to revenge kill weakened threats and chip away at Pokemon such as Primal Groudon. 224 Speed EVs are used to outspeed +1 Rayquaza and Kyurem-W. 32 EVs are slotted to Defense to ensure that Genesect gets a Special Attack boost from Download. The set revolves around the use of a Choice Scarf, which allows Xerneas to revenge kill threats such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, Deoxys-A, and weakened Arceus formes. Running 252 Speed EVs is an option that allows Choice Scarf Xerneas to outspeed maximum Speed Deoxys-A and tie with opposing 252 Speed Choice Scarf Xerneas. If using Rock Slide, the 32 Defense EVs can be invested into Attack, which slightly increases the damage output of Rock Slide but fails to meet a specific benchmark.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Capitalize on the ability to bluff a Geomancy set; this can allow a free KO on a Pokemon that assumed it was faster. One of this set's main draws is that it performs better against Darkrai than most Pokemon, although you mustn't switch it directly into an obvious Sludge Bomb or into Dark Void if you aren't running Sleep Talk. Be very aware of what move Xerneas is being locked into; for example, if your team is in a situation where it cannot afford to allow Mega Salamence to set up, do not KO a Pokemon with a move that is not Moonblast. Aromatherapy is best used on turns where you are certain that the opponent is going to switch because Xerneas is threatening one of their crucial Pokemon. However, if they are going to a Pokemon such as Double Dance Primal Groudon, make sure you can afford to give it one free turn. Prediction is unfortunately a large part of using this set. When considering what Pokemon is going to come in, consider other factors as well, such as risk associated with getting locked into this move against one possible switch-in versus the potential benefit to be gained by predicting correctly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Xerneas is generally a pretty self-reliant set, although a few partners can offer offensive and defensive synergy. Primal Groudon is an effective partner that can deal significant damage to a wide range of typical Choice Scarf Xerneas switch-ins. Furthermore, it benefits from Xerneas's ability to threaten Darkrai and Yveltal. Mega Salamence can provide Choice Scarf Xerneas with a method of threatening Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, both of which are commonly used to tank Moonblasts. Mega Gengar can eliminate or force a trade with a troublesome Pokemon so that Moonblast spam becomes much more potent. Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O greatly benefit from Xerneas's ability to check Darkrai and Yveltal, and Arceus-Ghost performs well against Mega Gengar and can burn troublesome Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp. Latias and Latios also benefit from Xerneas's ability to check Dark-types, and they can offer anti-entry hazard support and threaten Primal Groudon. Arceus-Ground is capable of breaking down most checks to Choice Scarf Xerneas, while Arceus-Rock can provide a very stable switch-in for Ho-Oh.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Though Xerneas's power after a Geomancy is frightening, the move can make Xerneas somewhat inflexible, as it only gets one chance to set up. Choice Specs allows Xerneas to retain a large degree of raw strength while making it more flexible as a hole puncher in the early- and mid-game. Moonblast becomes incredibly strong after Choice Specs, boasting enough power to 3HKO support Primal Groudon and nearly 2HKO Klefki, two of the most common switch-ins to Xerneas. Even Ho-Oh and Lugia are 2HKOed by Moonblast after Stealth Rock damage, making only Blissey and very bulky Steel-types safe from Xerneas's rampage. Hidden Power Fire cannot hurt Primal Groudon, but when compared to the alternative, Focus Blast, it keeps the same KOs against Ferrothorn and Klefki with better accuracy, destroys Mega Scizor, and can also be used to 3HKO very bulky Steel-types such as Aegislash, Bronzong, and defensive Jirachi. Focus Blast gives Xerneas an alternative weapon against Steel-types, decimating Ferrothorn and Excadrill and 2HKOing Klefki after Stealth Rock damage. Focus Blast even has about an 80% chance to 2HKO support Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage, though repeated Moonblasts will usually be sufficient to wear it down. Grass Knot gives Xerneas an accurate move for hitting Primal Groudon hard, doing as much damage as Focus Blast would. It also OHKOes Arceus formes that are weak to Grass-type moves after Stealth Rock damage. On the other hand, Thunder allows Xerneas to OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Lugia through Multiscale while also allowing for a slightly stronger hit than Moonblast against Primal Kyogre. The last moves worth considering are Aromatherapy and Psyshock. Aromatherapy can let Xerneas support its team by clearing status, though most of the time it is better off attacking. Psyshock is Xerneas's best weapon against Blissey, 2HKOing it after Stealth Rock damage. It also does more damage to Ho-Oh than Moonblast.</p> <p>Sleep Talk deserves a special mention, as it allows Xerneas to switch into Darkrai that lack Sludge Bomb fearlessly and potentially bluff a Choice Scarf set, allowing it to then KO Darkrai next turn or force it out; however, it can only do this once, as a Life Orb boosted Thunder from Darkrai will KO Xerneas after Bad Dreams damage. A smart opponent will also do damage calculations against whatever comes in to check what item Xerneas is holding, essentially preventing you from bluffing the item more than once. It should be noted that if Sleep Talk is used, the moveset should consist purely of Moonblast and Sleep Talk to ensure Moonblast will always be used whenever Xerneas is asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A simple spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe works here, as maximum Speed allows Xerneas to outspeed standard support Arceus formes, most Lugia sets, and any other Pokemon using a neutral nature below the 100 Speed tier. A Timid nature can be used if you wish to outspeed all Rayquaza variants and Modest Latios.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Xerneas in on something it can force to switch out and click Moonblast — it does a lot of damage even to Pokemon that resist it, so don't be afraid to spam it. Coverage moves are fine to use to try and snipe a certain switch-in, but caution should be exercised because Xerneas's coverage moves are either inaccurate or weak against neutral targets. Focus Blast and Thunder also give free turns to Mega Gengar and Primal Groudon, respectively, both dangerous foes against which you never usually want to do so. Try to get Stealth Rock up before unleashing Xerneas — it greatly inhibits Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Lugia that would otherwise be able to switch in comfortably.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Xerneas requires Stealth Rock support to keep Ho-Oh at bay and secure certain KOs. Primal Groudon is the best user of Stealth Rock in the metagame, though Tyranitar, Dialga, Bronzong, and Deoxys formes also make good options. Even with Stealth Rock, however, reliable switch-ins to Ho-Oh such as Arceus-Water, Arceus-Rock, and Refresh Mega Salamence are good partners. Powerful Fire-types such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh also make excellent partners to deal with Blissey and bulky Steel-types that can wall Xerneas. Knock Off Yveltal specifically makes for a good partner to ease with opposing Ho-Oh, Blissey, and Klefki. It also checks every defensive Steel-type that would switch into Xerneas. Lures such as Hidden Power Fire Latios and trappers such as Mega Gengar also make good alternative ways to deal with Steel-types.</p> <p>Choice Specs Xerneas is very efficient at wearing down Primal Groudon, so Pokemon that appreciate Primal Groudon weakened or KOed make fine teammates. Primal Kyogre is the most notable of these, as with Primal Groudon gone it can spam rain-boosted STAB Water-type attacks with near impunity. The list is quite extensive — Mega Salamence, Mega Gengar, Mewtwo, Mega Tyranitar, and Calm Mind Arceus-Rock all greatly appreciate having Primal Groudon taken down early. These Pokemon can also all help weaken Steel-types for Xerneas to break past later on.</p>"
      },
      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast hits especially hard with both Fairy Aura and a Life Orb, and it is the strongest STAB move available to Xerneas. Aromatherapy allows Xerneas to provide support to teammates, and it can be used on the turn Xerneas forces an opposing Pokemon out. Thunder hits Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Lugia hard and also hits a few Pokemon that resist Moonblast and resist or are immune to Fighting-type coverage moves, such as Aegislash and Arceus-Poison. Rock Slide hits Ho-Oh significantly harder than Thunder, but it doesn't hit any other targets. Close Combat is a physical Fighting-type move that can break through Blissey, and it can also hit most other Steel-types well. Focus Blast inflicts special damage on Steel-types and doesn't lower Xerneas's defenses, but the cost is reduced accuracy and struggling more against Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used to ensure high damage output from Moonblast and Xerneas's special coverage moves. A Mild nature is preferred to better switch into Yveltal without forfeiting physical attacking power. Alternatively, a Rash nature is an option for teams that would rather benefit from Xerneas taking physical attacks such as priority moves. 224 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza and all slower threats. The remaining 32 EVs are slotted into Attack, which raises the damage output of Close Combat slightly and increases the probability of Xerneas being able to OHKO standard Ho-Oh with Rock Slide. Xerneas should use a Modest nature if it is not using any physical attacks. A Life Orb gives Xerneas the means of hitting most targets hard either with its Fairy Aura-boosted STAB move or with the appropriate coverage move. An Expert Belt trades a bit of power in exchange for not taking recoil damage; the second benefit, however, is that Xerneas becomes very good at bluffing the much more common Geomancy or Choice Scarf sets.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although it's not nearly as good at bluffing a Geomancy set as the Choice Scarf set because the Life Orb recoil gives it away after one attack, this initial turn can still be used to make your opponent think you might set up. If using an Expert Belt, this advantage can be extended. Unlike the Geomancy set, this set does not have any bulk investment and is further impacted defensively by Life Orb recoil, so it shouldn't be sent into very many attacks, even if they are resisted. Because this set is strong immediately, it can be used to whittle down many conventional Geomancy Xerneas checks such as Primal Groudon and Klefki because they focus on eliminating a one-time threat. Make use of Aromatherapy support where needed, but be aware that if you aren't using it on the opponent's switch, it may be the last move Xerneas uses before being knocked out. This set doesn't need to worry nearly as much about prediction as the Choice Scarf set because Xerneas won't be locked into its moves and is faster than many of the targets of its coverage move anyway; for this reason, consider making safer plays than when using the Choice Scarf set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon can smash Steel-types and Ho-Oh, which may be troublesome for Xerneas to break down, and it benefits from Xerneas checking Yveltal. Calm Mind Arceus formes can be used to break down several Xerneas checks, while a surprise Rock Slide from Xerneas that KOes Ho-Oh can greatly assist Calm Mind Arceus; Calm Mind Arceus formes also benefit from cleric support provided by Aromatherapy. Mega Salamence also benefits from cleric support and can effectively threaten Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Calm Mind Primal Kyogre greatly benefits from the pressure that Xerneas can place on opposing Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Primal Groudon. Latias and Latios appreciate cleric support and Xerneas checking Yveltal, and in return they provide anti-hazard support, which can increase the number of times Xerneas can switch in. Giratina-O provides an immunity to Extreme Speed along with the ability to burn Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp, while Xerneas can check Yveltal in return. Users of U-turn and Volt Switch can provide more opportunities for Xerneas to come in, while entry hazard setters can help Xerneas break down Steel-types. Lastly, Healing Wish support can allow Xerneas another chance to wallbreak.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is by far the best choice for mono-attacking Xerneas, as no Pokemon are immune to the move and many relevant threats get slammed by it. Sleep Talk is used so that the two turns after the use of Rest aren't wasted it and allows Xerneas to directly switch into Dark Void and Spore as sleep fodder with little to lose. Rest is the only recovery move available to Xerneas, although it does fully restore health and eliminate status conditions. Aromatherapy is primarily for cleric support, but it also has a one in three chance to be selected by Sleep Talk, possibly resulting in a shortened Rest. Roar can be used to phaze Pokemon that may attempt to set up and can rack up residual damage from entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to significantly raise defensive Xerneas's mixed bulk. 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature are used to maximize physical bulk, which helps Xerneas tank blows in a predominantly physical metagame. The remaining 8 EVs are slotted into Special Defense. Leftovers is the preferred held item, as it reduces the number of Pokemon capable of 3HKOing Xerneas while also helping to mitigate residual damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't underestimate this set's physical bulk. Gyro Ball and Iron Head Aegislash deal pitiful damage, while even Primal Groudon doesn't deal significant damage unless boosted; this translates to having more opportunities to use Aromatherapy and having to use Rest not as frequently. There is a balance to maintain between using Rest too frequently and not enough. If not careful, a high damage roll or critical hit can finish Xerneas right before it has a chance to use Rest. However, using Rest too much means leaving Xerneas more exploitable during the turns it is asleep. Be very wary of Mega Gengar, which can easily trap and eliminate this set. Don't always count on Sleep Talk to produce Moonblast, Aromatherapy, or Roar; a third of the time, the turn will still be wasted if it selects Rest.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Pursuit trapper is wanted, as Mega Gengar is very threatening for this set and a means of eliminating it is the best solution. Primal Groudon appreciates the cleric support Xerneas provides and can threaten many common checks to Xerneas such as Steel-types and Ho-Oh. Mega Salamence also appreciates Aromatherapy support and can check Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh for Xerneas. Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O benefit from cleric support and Xerneas's ability to check Yveltal, and in return Arceus-Ghost can burn Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp. Latios and Latias greatly appreciate cleric support and Xerneas's ability to check Yveltal, while they can check Primal Groudon and use Defog to remove entry hazards. Arceus-Ground can break through the Steel-types that can give defensive Xerneas trouble, and it can also check Primal Groudon. Lugia greatly benefits from cleric support and is a good defensive check for Primal Groudon. If using Roar, Xerneas benefits from having entry hazard setters as partners so that Roar deals residual damage upon phazing.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Xerneas's stats, but the advantages it has over Geomancy are that it can be set up more than once, can be set up consecutively, and doesn't forfeit the item slot. Sleep Talk is used so that turns spent Resting are not always wasted; this allows Xerneas to be able to continually set up Calm Mind or fire off some Moonblasts. Rest is needed in order to maintain longevity and it also removes status ailments such as Toxic, which would otherwise be problematic for this set. Moonblast is the best attacking move for mono-attacking Xerneas, as no Pokemon are immune to it, it is the strongest move available, and has a chance at lowering the opponent's Special Attack stat one stage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to increase overall bulk, which aids in the set up of Calm Mind and the use of Rest. 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature are used to reduce the damage from physical attacks, especially from Aegislash and Primal Groudon. The remaining 8 EVs are placed into Special Defense. Leftovers helps to offset residual damage and makes it more difficult for foes to 3HKO Xerneas before it can use Rest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set works best if kept hidden until the end of the match, when strong physical attackers have been eliminated; this makes it much more difficult for the opponent to dispose of this set. Calm Mind quickly allows Xerneas's special bulk to exceed its physical bulk, making it good at taking hits from a variety of attackers. Set up Calm Mind as needed, but be sure not to forget to keep Xerneas healthy enough to use Rest before being knocked out. This set can be used as a status sponge if needed, as Rest can eliminate status at a later time. Maintaining a balance of using Rest is important for this set; too little use means that Xerneas risks being knocked out in a later situation before it is able to heal, while too much use means that Xerneas risks being more vulnerable during turns asleep. Although this set is a passive Calm Mind user that fears phazing, this can be circumvented by using it as a final Pokemon. Note that unlike other Xerneas sets, Calm Mind Xerneas can set up against opposing Klefki.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>One of this set's greatest fears is Mega Gengar, so a Pursuit trapper that can eliminate it is much appreciated. Primal Groudon appreciates the check to Yveltal Xerneas provides and can threaten several checks to Xerneas such as Steel-types and Ho-Oh. Mega Salamence can check Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh for Xerneas. Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O benefit from Xerneas's ability to check Yveltal, and in return Arceus-Ghost can burn troublesome Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp. Latios and Latias greatly appreciate Xerneas's ability to check Yveltal, and they can check Primal Groudon, and remove entry hazards with Defog. Hidden Power Fire Latios and Latias especially are great for wearing down Iron Head Aegislash and Ferrothorn. Arceus-Ground can break through the Steel-types that can give Calm Mind Xerneas trouble, and it can check Primal Groudon. Lastly, Lugia provides a good defensive check to Primal Groudon that also benefits from Xerneas's ability to check Dark-types.</p>"

  "Yveltal": {
    "overview": "<p>Yveltal is blessed by its incredible typing and stat spread, as they give it amazing versatility. Dark Aura adds to this by giving it a boost to its already powerful Dark-type STAB attacks. Yveltal's bulk, typing, access to recovery, and power make it a decent check to Primal Groudon, as well as one of the best switch-ins to Arceus-Ghost. It is one of the best users of Life Orb in Ubers thanks to its strong signature move, Oblivion Wing; it is also able to pull off a dangerous bulky set due to its access to Roost and Dark Aura-boosted Foul Play. Yveltal also has access to the strongest priority move in the game, Dark Aura-boosted Sucker Punch. Although its typing isn't bad defensively, it doesn't offer many resistances, and it leaves Yveltal weak to Stealth Rock as well as Fairy- and Rock-type attacks while its two immunities are voided by common coverage moves. Yveltal's Speed is enough to get it past the horde of Pokemon with Speed stats in between base 90 and 95, but it is still rather slow when compared to quite a few threats in Ubers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Substitute + Disable set is definitely possible. Yveltal is a bit slow, but it deals a lot of damage with Dark Pulse and assumed entry hazard damage once it gets going. Hurricane has similar power to Dark Aura-boosted Dark Pulse, but with Primal Groudon and all of the Pokemon that resist Flying being very prevalent, it usually isn't worth the slot. Knock Off is an interesting option on the Life Orb set, but with all of the items that are \"immune\" to it, it is a rather subpar option. It would be used to hit Ho-Oh, Blissey, and Fairy-types holding Leftovers. Note that only the Life Orb set should even think about running this. The Choice Scarf set would become setup fodder for Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, while the defensive set can't fit it anywhere. A physical set of Hone Claws, Sky Attack, Knock Off, and Sucker Punch can be used with Power Herb as an item. This set destroys Xerneas and Clefable switch-ins, but the set itself is rather unreliable. Choice Specs can be used over Life Orb for more immediate power and no recoil, though this comes at the cost of being unable to switch between attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Arceus-Fairy, Diancie, Klefki, and Xerneas all force Yveltal out. Klefki needs to watch out for Heat Wave, and the rest need to watch out for the Trap-turn strategy when Yveltal is paired with Mega Gengar. Xerneas is 2HKOed by Life Orb Oblivion Wing after Stealth Rock damage, which is something to watch out for.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Arceus-Dark and Tyranitar are both good examples of Dark-types that check Yveltal. However, Tyranitar has a bit of trouble with the defensive set and has to watch out for a rogue Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Ice, and Arceus-Electric</strong>: Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Ice, and Arceus-Electric all outspeed and KO Yveltal with Judgment. However, they do have to be careful when switching into Yveltal as Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse + Sucker Punch has a very slight chance to KO these Arceus formes.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom forces Yveltal out but cannot come in on a Dark Pulse or Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-W</strong>: Kyurem-W cannot come in on offensive Yveltal at all, but it can force out defensive Yveltal with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Letting Yveltal get burned makes using it much trickier, as this cuts the power of its physical moves in half and deals more residual damage, which is especially troublesome for Life Orb Yveltal. Toxic ruins the defensive set.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Band and Dark Aura boost the strength of Knock Off to lethal levels, making it Yveltal's STAB move of choice. It is powerful enough to OHKO Ho-Oh and 2HKO Klefki, both conventional Yveltal checks, and Knock Off's item removal effect makes it extremely dangerous for Xerneas to switch in lest it be neutered by prematurely losing its Power Herb. U-turn is useful to pivot out of Pokemon that Choice Band Yveltal does not necessarily match up well against, such as support Arceus formes. U-turn also scores an easy 2HKO on Tyranitar, which doesn't necessarily mind taking Knock Off. While it may seem counterintuitive to run Foul Play on a Choice Band set, the boost conferred by Choice Band does make it powerful enough to 2HKO all variants of Primal Groudon and OHKO offensive Mega Salamence variants after Stealth Rock, neither of which Knock Off can accomplish. Sucker Punch rounds out the set by providing extremely strong priority to check Pokemon faster than Yveltal, easily destroying fast Psychic-types such as Mewtwo and doing upwards of 70% damage to offensive Mega Salamence. Steel Wing can also be used to reliably 2HKO Xerneas and OHKO Mega Diancie, though it is weak against all other targets.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are necessary to allow Yveltal to hit as hard as possible, securing the OHKO on Ho-Oh and the 2HKO on Klefki and Skarmory. 32 Defense EVs grant Yveltal guaranteed survival against a +2 Extreme Speed from both Jolly Life Orb and Adamant Silk Scarf variants of Extreme Killer Arceus, and they also allow Yveltal to survive Choice Band Dragon Ascent from Jolly Rayquaza at full HP. The remaining EVs go into Speed, letting Yveltal outpace any neutral-natured Pokemon below the base 95 Speed tier. A Jolly nature can be used instead to outrun any Rayquaza variant and Modest Latios, but the power drop is noticeable, and Yveltal's access to Sucker Punch means the added Speed usually isn't necessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in Yveltal against Pokemon it can force to switch out—typically Ghost- or Psychic-types—and just throw out attacks. Knock Off's power and item removal effect make it safe to spam in most cases, easily tearing apart most checks to special Yveltal sets and still leaving a noticeable dent in Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes. Since a purely physical Yveltal set carries some surprise value, one can try switching in Yveltal against Pokemon special attacking sets would normally force out such as Primal Groudon to create an opening for a free attack. Despite being boosted by Choice Band, U-turn does not do much damage to neutral targets, so it is generally best saved for pivoting out of checks such as Tyranitar and support Arceus formes; otherwise, simply spamming Knock Off is usually the superior option. Be careful with this Yveltal set against faster targets, as the move restrictions of Choice Band may not necessarily allow Yveltal to take out a faster foe with Sucker Punch immediately.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar is strongly recommended for use with Choice Band Yveltal. It can take advantage of opportunities to switch in afforded by Yveltal's U-turn to Mega Evolve safely, and it is key in removing support Arceus formes (especially Arceus-Fairy, which takes little damage from all of Yveltal's attacks) that may be holding back Yveltal from laying waste to the opponent's team. Although Yveltal can deal significant damage to most Fairy-type Pokemon in Ubers with Knock Off, it is still vulnerable to being revenge killed by them, so reliable Fairy-type checks are still necessary. Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Bronzong are among the best at this role, and all three provide entry hazard support to help Choice Band Yveltal secure KOs. Primal Groudon can also status support Arceus formes to help Yveltal break through them, or it can simply KO support Arceus formes itself with Swords Dance-boosted attacks. Choice Band Yveltal has no way to recover HP, so hazard removal support is strongly advised. Arceus-Water is particularly notable for providing a strong answer to Primal Groudon and Mega Diancie, both of which can take two Knock Offs from Choice Band Yveltal. Arceus-Dragon and Arceus-Ground perform similarly, though the former cannot check Mega Diancie.</p> <p>Offensively, Choice Band Yveltal tends to lure in and destroy Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Klefki that would normally be good checks to special attacking Yveltal sets. Xerneas benefits significantly from these Pokemon being gone and can take advantage of Yveltal's U-turn to find an opportunity to set up with Geomancy safely, making it an ideal offensive complement. While Deoxys-A can often punch through Ho-Oh on its own, it does appreciate Klefki being taken out, and Yveltal can buy it free opportunities to switch in with U-turn to punish switch-ins such as support Arceus formes.</p>"

      "Strong Bird": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Pulse is an amazing STAB move that is not only the strongest Dark-type move in the game when boosted by Dark Aura but can also cause flinches to help overcome sticky situations. It is very useful for getting chip damage off against Fairy-types. Oblivion Wing is Yveltal's other STAB move, with the amazing side effect of leeching 75% of the damage done to the foe, giving Yveltal some longevity. It also 2HKOes most Xerneas with the slightest amount of chip damage. Sucker Punch helps Yveltal overcome its average Speed and is the strongest priority move in the game due to Yveltal's Attack stat and the Dark Aura boost. Heat Wave does about 80% to Klefki, forcing it to use a last-ditch status move or Spikes. Either way, if you hit it on the switch, it severely limits Klefki's playability due to its lack of recovery. Focus Blast is an option to hit Tyranitar, but it is generally inferior to the other moves Yveltal runs. Taunt can be used to cripple Klefki as they switch in. It works very well alongside Sucker Punch due to how hard it can be to switch into offensive Yveltal. U-turn can be used alongside Mega Gengar to help it trap Fairy-types that Yveltal draws in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Yveltal's Dark Pulse and Oblivion Wing to hit as hard as possible. 96 Speed EVs allow Yveltal to outrun Lugia that have no Speed invested and are more than enough to outrun standard Geomancy Xerneas. 132 HP EVs give Yveltal respectable bulk and the ability to survive Mega Salamence's Return only after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack to power up Sucker Punch. A Rash nature is used instead of Mild in order to make Yveltal take less damage from Extreme Speed and Primal Groudon's Stone Edge or Fire Punch. A Mild nature can be used if Mewtwo is the bigger concern, though. Black Glasses should be used with U-turn so that Yveltal takes less chip damage when switching in, though without Life Orb, Oblivion Wing's power is significantly reduced versus Primal Groudon and Xerneas.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Yveltal's two immunities are its best tool for switching it in. Be aware that common coverage moves such as Stone Edge from Ground-types and Ice Beam from Mewtwo hurt a lot, though. When facing down Groudon, it is best to use Oblivion Wing first. Dark Pulse KOes Groudon after Oblivion Wing damage but will never OHKO a healthy Primal Groudon. Use Oblivion Wing whenever a free turn presents itself, such as when Yveltal forces a switch or outspeeds a foe, and when Yveltal's health is starting to dwindle. Never switch Yveltal out against setup sweepers, as its power is great enough that it can KO most of these very easily should they try to set up on it recklessly. Damaging these Pokemon can mean the difference between a win and a loss. This set can be used to cripple and weaken Klefki and prevent it from setting up Spikes, and it can punish Defog users such as Giratina-O, Latios, and Latias. If you choose to run Focus Blast, use it to OHKO Tyranitar to help out a Flying-type partner such as Ho-Oh, but don't switch Yveltal into Tyranitar on a free switch, as this will likely alert your opponent as to what is going on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Xerneas greatly enjoys the pressure Yveltal puts on Klefki and, if Yveltal lands a Heat Wave on the switch, the two will begin to wreak havoc for the rest of the game. Yveltal also soft checks Primal Groudon, which eases using Xerneas tremendously. Yveltal is very difficult to fit on a team due to its lack of defensive utility, but some offensive builds like its unparalleled ability to deal massive damage to Xerneas checks. Threats such as the aforementioned Xerneas, Ho-Oh, Klefki, Mega Diancie, and Mega Metagross all partner very well with it depending on the team structure. Mega Gengar and Yveltal form a neat U-turn and Shadow Tag core should Yveltal use U-Turn and Gengar carry Sludge Wave. Trapping the Fairy-types Yveltal brings in with Mega Gengar gives Yveltal an amazing window to begin doing damage. Fairy-type switch-ins are almost mandatory, with Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Klefki, Aegislash, and Jirachi being some of the best.</p>"

      "Tough Bird (Flying Tank)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dark Aura-boosted STAB Foul Play prevents any boosting physical attacker from setting up and staying in on Yveltal. Roost is Yveltal's form of reliable recovery that also removes its Flying typing for the turn, meaning slower Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type attacks will no longer be super effective the turn this move is used. Toxic helps Yveltal deal with other walls and helps punish a lot of its switch-ins, namely Xerneas. Taunt is primarily used to cripple Klefki so it can't use Yveltal as Spikes or status fodder. It also prevents Calm Mind and support Arceus formes from setting up or using Recover after they have been badly poisoned by Toxic. Its only other function is toying with Ferrothorn, Forretress, and other slower support Pokemon. Sucker Punch gives Yveltal the ability to check Mewtwo as well as pick off other weakened dedicated attackers. Alternatively, Heat Wave 2HKOes Klefki and also allows Yveltal to cook Ferrothorn and Scizor if it can find the window to. It makes Yveltal nearly useless versus stall teams, however, because it must be run over Taunt in order to be used effectively. Make sure to have solid ways of dealing with stall teams when using Heat Wave.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Running maximum Defense investment allows Yveltal to take strong physical attacks. The HP investment nearly maximizes Yveltal's ability to take physical hits while minimizing the amount of damage it takes from Stealth Rock. A Bold nature is preferred when using Toxic; if Yveltal has Sucker Punch on its set, use an Impish nature to maximize Sucker Punch's damage with no Attack investment. Charti Berry allows Yveltal to more effectively check Stone Edge Extreme Killer Arceus and Primal Groudon. Dread Plate can be used to boost the power of Foul Play and Sucker Punch if it's necessary; it notably allows Foul Play to OHKO +2 Attack Extreme Killer Arceus without help from Stealth Rock or Life Orb damage. Use a Bold nature when using Heat Wave.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep in mind Yveltal is a physical tank that is weak to Stealth Rock and sometimes doesn't hold Leftovers. It will be forced to use Roost at some point, so make sure you have solid ways of dealing with its switch-ins. Be careful around Extreme Killer Arceus if the composition of the opposing team suggests it carries Stone Edge, because if it does, Yveltal cannot effectively check it. The tell-tale signs of Stone Edge Arceus are it being on a hyper offensive team with few to no Mega Salamence checks, with Arceus being the only Pokemon that Salamence easily sets up on. Many of Yveltal's switch-ins, such as Fairy-types and bulky Arceus formes, hate Toxic, so it will be the move you choose most against opposing switches. Yveltal can come in on almost any physical attacker in the Ubers metagame and proceed to KO it with a Foul Play or two. Ho-Oh is a very troublesome physical attacker due to Sacred Fire's extremely high burn probability. Burn does affect Foul Play's damage, so staying in on Ho-Oh is not advisable in most situations. On a similar note, Primal Groudon's Lava Plume also has a nasty burn rate and does very good damage to Yveltal. Other than that, it is a relatively straightforward Pokemon to use.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A couple solid switch-ins to Xerneas are required when using defensive Yveltal. Specially defensive Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Klefki are good examples of these. On the other hand, Yveltal is one of the best switch-ins to Primal Groudon there are, so partnering it with Xerneas is also not a bad idea. Softer checks to Extreme Killer Arceus such as Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost are useful in case it has Stone Edge. Defog and Rapid Spin users are also very welcome partners for Yveltal, with the most notable being Latios and Latias due to their sheer reliability.</p>"

      "Fashionable Bird (Choice Scarf)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Foul Play is Yveltal's weapon against Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Mewtwo Y, Swords Dance Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Ghost, and Rayquaza. Dark Pulse is Yveltal's reliable STAB move. It has phenomenal neutral coverage and, with Yveltal's Choice Scarf, allows it to revenge kill many potent threats such as Mega Gengar, Mewtwo, and with some prior damage, Latios and Latias. Oblivion Wing is Yveltal's way of recovering health after a couple Stealth Rock switch-ins and allows Yveltal to revenge kill Mega Mewtwo X, check Blaziken, and steal a bit of health off of anything inside Oblivion Wing's KO range. U-turn is for switch initiative and for scouting for a less obvious Arceus-Dark or Arceus-Fairy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>32 HP and 4 Defense EVs allow Yveltal to always survive a +2 Extreme Speed from standard Extreme Killer Arceus in order to KO it with Foul Play after recoil from its own Life Orb. This also leaves Yveltal with an odd HP number, which allows it to switch into Stealth Rock four times instead of three. The Speed EVs conveniently allow Yveltal to outspeed the rare but extremely dangerous +1 Adamant Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Modest Choice Scarf Kyurem-W. 248 Special Attack EVs power up Dark Pulse and Oblivion Wing. A Modest nature must be used, as otherwise Dark Pulse misses out on quite a few key KOs, such as a 2HKO on offensive Primal Groudon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Yveltal should be used primarily as a revenge killer, but it can also tank a hit and deal very good damage and possibly KO in return. Using U-turn to scout for Arceus-Fairy or Arceus-Dark is a very good way to gain information on the opposing team's structure early. Remember that this is not the strongest Yveltal set out there, so use very clear discretion when picking what move to lock yourself into, or risk becoming setup bait for quite a few extremely dangerous Pokemon in Ubers. If you wish at all to use this as an Extreme Killer Arceus check, you must not let Stealth Rock be set up before Arceus comes in, otherwise either you give it two turns to set up Swords Dance while you use Defog or Yveltal falls to +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Yveltal needs extremely solid checks to Geomancy Xerneas on its team, no questions asked. Klefki and specially defensive Primal Groudon are among the best. Because it can't switch moves and has less power than other sets, Choice Scarf Yveltal works best on more balanced builds that can run solid switch-ins to Fairy-types and other special attackers. These builds also carry Defog users to help Yveltal out with its Stealth Rock weakness. Latias, Latios, Arceus-Water, Arceus-Rock, and Giratina-O are all good examples of Defog users. Magic Bounce users alongside Defog users is also a nice prospect just to preserve Yveltal's ability to smack around +2 Arceus.</p>"

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Upon Mega Evolving, Diancie gains an incredibly useful new ability, Magic Bounce. Mega Diancie is also graced with powerful base 160 offensive stats coupled with a fast base 110 Speed. These stats when combined with its Rock / Fairy typing allow it to check common threats such as Darkrai, Yveltal, Ho-Oh, Latias, and Lugia. Regular Diancie is no slouch either; although its offenses are low, its bulk can be quite useful, and it doesn't take up a Mega slot. Despite having some key resistances, Diancie is hampered by a 4x weakness to Steel and a weakness to common Ground-type moves. While Diancie does have access to useful support moves such as Heal Bell, Stealth Rock, and Trick Room, its lack of instant recovery is quite disappointing. Diancie's movepool on the offensive side is somewhat similar, as it can make use of two excellent STAB moves and Earth Power but does not have many other tricks. Both Diancie and Mega Diancie are stuck with a low base 50 HP, and Mega Evolving Diancie proves quite difficult, as it keeps its low Speed for that turn while losing a lot of its bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive RestTalk set similar to RestTalk + Aromatherapy Xerneas is possible, as Diancie has access to Rest, Sleep Talk, and Heal Bell, but it is usually outclassed by Xerneas. Diancie does have access to dual screens, but with the prevalence of Defog, they are typically not a good choice. Magnet Rise is an interesting option, as several Pokemon can only hit Diancie with Ground-type moves, but it is often situational and prediction-reliant. Lastly, Rock Polish can be using to greatly increase Mega Diancie's Speed on an offensive set, but most common checks still beat it regardless of its Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although Steel tends to be a poor offensive type, it is highly threatening to Diancie, as it exploits a 4x weakness. As a result, Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Mega Lucario can blast through any Diancie set. Dialga can also do this, but only if it is running Flash Cannon. Klefki can also get around Mega Diancie's attempts to stop it setting Spikes by running Flash Cannon. Even though the offensive set's coverage options of Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire can deal significant damage to or even knock out predicted switch-ins, Steel-types are still excellent checks to Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: Arceus-Ground is a very popular Arceus forme that can squash all Diancie sets with super effective Earthquake or Judgment. Defensive Diancie sets can, however, Toxic it as it comes in.</p> <p><strong>Other Ground-types</strong>: In a similar vein to Arceus-Ground, Ground-types in general are solid checks to every Diancie set. Although most Ground-types in Ubers can OHKO Diancie, most don't like switching into Toxic, and Primal Groudon takes a large amount of damage from Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre is a great check to all Diancie sets. Origin Pulse will OHKO Diancie, while Diancie cannot deal very significant damage in return, especially if it's running a defensive set.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Moves</strong>: A few of the Pokemon that Diancie would check in an ideal scenario can carry coverage moves to circumvent it. Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Mega Salamence can all carry Earthquake, which will deal serious damage to if not OHKO Diancie. Darkrai and Yveltal can be carrying Thunder or Focus Blast, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Arceus Formes</strong>: Although Diancie can beat Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, other formes can be potentially problematic. Calm Mind Arceus with dual coverage can be slapped with Toxic, although the offensive set does not run this move. Other Calm Mind Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Fairy, can afford to run a move such as Refresh that makes Toxic useless. Calm Mind Mega Diancie does not have the bulk or recovery to take on Calm Mind Arceus formes, so keep that in mind.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Shaymin-S, Mewtwo, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Choice Scarf users can all revenge kill Mega Diancie, but some can have trouble switching in. Darkrai and Mega Gengar can also finish off a weakened Diancie. Latios and Latias can potentially win a Speed tie and KO a weakened Diancie with Psyshock or Grass Knot.</p>",

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is Mega Diancie's primary option for a STAB attack, allowing it to check Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon. Meanwhile, Diamond Storm has use to hit threats such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Blissey; it also prevents Diancie from being trapped and becoming setup bait to the rare Gothitelle. Earth Power is typically Diancie's best option for a coverage move, as it hits common switch-ins such as Primal Groudon and Steel-types. In the final slot, Diancie has several options. Protect ensures a safe Mega Evolution and has other utility such as scouting. Heal Bell, on the other hand, allows Diancie to give emergency cleric support for a more offensive team. Lastly, Calm Mind can be used to turn Diancie into a stallbreaker that doesn't mind Ho-Oh or Lugia, two common threats to Calm Mind users. Magic Bounce further supports Diancie's efforts to use Calm Mind, as it provides an immunity to Toxic and phazing moves, thus allowing Calm Mind Diancie to pressure stall teams hard if opposing Primal Groudon and Kyogre have been eliminated.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire is an alternate coverage move for Diancie that hits switch-ins such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Genesect much harder than Earth Power. In the final slot, Stealth Rock is an option if it is too detrimental to fit anywhere else on your team, and Mega Diancie has the benefit of being immune to Taunt; however, Mega Diancie's lack of bulk compared to alternative non-suicide entry hazard setters is disappointing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Mega Diancie to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon. A Timid nature is used because the Attack drop does not significantly impact any targets of Diamond Storm, although Naive is an option to have sightly more physical power at the cost of some special bulk. Significant Special Attack investment keeps this set offensive and allows it to OHKO threats such as Rayquaza and Mega Salamence. The remaining EVs go into Attack to make Diamond Storm hit slightly harder. If Hidden Power Fire is being used, run at least 180 Speed EVs with a Timid nature due to the IV drop. Maximum Speed is an option when Diancie is not using Hidden Power Fire to Speed tie with opposing base 110 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>A Modest nature can be used for the extra power and is best used with Calm Mind in the final slot. The added power gives Mega Diancie the ability to OHKO Pokemon such as Giratina-O and Latios, as well as 2HKO Arceus formes that do not have defensive investment, provided Stealth Rock is in play. After a Calm Mind boost, Modest Mega Diancie is able to duel Arceus-Water and win, and it can also OHKO the standard Primal Groudon set with a +1 Earth Power, something a Timid nature falls short of. A +1 Moonblast can 2HKO any Arceus forme that does not resist Fairy after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The Mega Evolution turn is very important, especially when Diancie is not using Protect. Diancie has more bulk when not Mega-Evolved, so when it needs to survive a certain attack, sometimes the right choice is to not Mega Evolve. When using Protect, the danger of giving your opponent a free setup turn is present, although you don't have to worry about entry hazard stacking. Mega Evolving early is important for a Magic Bounce user, as Mega Diancie will want to be sent in to Magic Bounce certain attacks. Because the intended targets of Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire can punish Mega Diancie hard, you'll often have to rely on predictions to hit them as they come in. Although Mega Diancie isn't a glass cannon, it's far from indestructible; because it lacks recovery, instantaneous or passive, there are only so many times this set can switch into even resisted attacks. Even though Mega Diancie has Magic Bounce, it doesn't necessarily lead well against all common leads; Primal Groudon and Dialga can be very dangerous due to their type advantages, as can Deoxys-A with Psycho Boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ho-Oh is an excellent partner for offensive Mega Diancie, as it threatens Steel-types and appreciates the anti-entry hazard support provided by Magic Bounce. Latias and Latios are good choices as well because they can fit on offensively oriented teams and provide a Ground immunity, while in return Diancie checks Dark-types and can offer cleric support. Giratina-O also provides a Ground immunity and appreciates Diancie's checking of common Dark-types. Primal Groudon also checks Kyogre and destroys Steel-types, which is highly useful for Diancie. Arceus-Ghost can check Extreme Killer Arceus and Landorus-T and benefits from Diancie's checking of Darkrai and Yveltal in return. Diancie can struggle with Calm Mind Arceus formes that aren't weak to Fairy, so checks such as Ho-Oh and Darkrai are appreciated.</p>"

      "Mega Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Protect is invaluable for ensuring a safe Mega Evolution turn and has general utility for scouting moves and stalling. Diamond Storm prevents this set from being bait for specially defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Blissey, and Gothitelle. Moonblast allows Mega Diancie to hit the Dark- and Dragon-types that it is intended to check, such as Darkrai and Rayquaza. Although Steel-types are immune to Toxic and tend to switch into Diancie, it is still a great move, as it can nail Arceus formes and Primal Groudon. Heal Bell provides cleric support to teammates and is especially useful because Mega Diancie is immune to Taunt. Although Stealth Rock is not slashed, Diancie can function as a setter if there is no room for the move on another teammate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs are used to make this set more bulky, but Mega Diancie is still hampered to an extent because of its low base HP along with its lack of instant recovery. 136 Speed EVs are just enough to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza. 124 Defense EVs with a Defense-boosting nature allow Mega Diancie to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Ho-Oh Brave Bird, survive Earthquake from maximum Attack Rayquaza, survive +1 Mega Salamence Earthquake, and tank other physical attacks. A Bold nature is used because the Attack drop does not significantly impact any targets of Diamond Storm. Impish is the better option if Diancie is not using Moonblast, though, as it will only have a physical move. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 Spe with a Bold nature beats base 90 Speed Pokemon and gains a bit of physical bulk. Maximum Defense is also an option to guarantee that Mega Diancie is 3HKOed by Choice Band Ho-Oh Brave Bird after Stealth Rock and survives +1 Mega Salamence Earthquake after Stealth Rock; the loss of Speed isn't that great of an issue, as Diancie loses to common base 90 Speed Pokemon anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Protect ensures Diancie's safe Mega Evolution, it can give the opposing Pokemon a free setup turn. It is also important to note that Diancie has better bulk before Mega Evolution, so don't Mega Evolve on an attack that would knock out Mega Diancie but that regular Diancie would survive. Even though Diamond Storm gives frequent Defense boosts, don't allow this to trick you into thinking that Mega Diancie can comfortably tank a Bullet Punch or Earthquake; it is usually better to switch into an appropriate counter. Mega Diancie is good at forcing switches, and it is during these times that it is best to use Heal Bell.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Latias and Latios are great partners for this set. Both greatly appreciate the cleric support and the check to Dark-types that Mega Diancie provides, and in return they check both Primal Groudon and Kyogre. Ho-Oh appreciates the anti-entry hazard support provided by Mega Diancie and can annihilate common Steel-types. Other Pokemon immune to Ground-type attacks, such as Giratina-O, are also good teammates for Mega Diancie and in return are provided cleric support. Arceus-Ghost is greatly threatened by Yveltal, Darkrai, and status users, all of which can be checked by Diancie while Arceus-Ghost can check Extreme Killer Arceus, Landorus-T, and Mewtwo. Due to its lack of instant recovery, Wish support for Mega Diancie is highly appreciated when using this set on more defensive teams. Lugia's common checks, such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, Taunt, and Dark-types, can all be effectively combated with Diancie, while Diancie appreciates Lugia's ability to check Primal Groudon. Primal Groudon serves as a good check to Kyogre and the Steel-types that can threaten Diancie. Due to Mewtwo's dislike for status and Yveltal, Diancie naturally pairs well with it.</p>"

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Diancie is a Trick Room setter that is not at all afraid of Ho-Oh or Yveltal, allowing it to provide effective support to its team. Stealth Rock is great on this set as well, as Diancie repels Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Diamond Storm is this set's best option for a STAB attack, as it deals significant damage to Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, offensive Yveltal, and Mega Salamence. Explosion can be a great last-ditch move, and when using it in conjunction with Trick Room, Diancie can KO itself on support Arceus formes and prevent Defog.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Because this set needs to be able to take a few hits as setup occurs, 248 HP EVs are used to offset Diancie's low base HP. Diancie already has very high defenses, so 252 Attack EVs with a Brave nature are used to allow Diamond Storm and Explosion to hit their intended targets as hard as possible. A Life Orb further boosts the power of Diancie's attacks at the cost of some HP; however, this drawback is completely irrelevant when using Explosion. A Speed-reducing nature in addition to 0 Speed IVs is used to minimize Diancie's Speed, allowing it to move first once Trick Room has been set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is underutilized, so its unexpectedness should be capitalized upon. Diancie can often set Trick Room on the switch, but unfortunately, Steel-types are highly threatening regardless of if Diancie moves first or not. Deciding when to, if at all, use Explosion can be tricky, particularly once the set is revealed, so be wary of Protect users and Ghost-types. This set can switch into Ho-Oh if necessary, but because its moves are physical, Diancie does not want to risk being burned from Sacred Fire.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The best teammates for this set are Pokemon that can effectively take advantage of Trick Room. Typically, the Pokemon are quite powerful and bulky but are also hampered by their mediocre Speed stats. Some examples of potential Trick Room attackers include Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Mega Mawile, and Ho-Oh. Dialga and Palkia are notorious setters and abusers of Trick Room and can dually function as checks to Kyogre. Ground-immune Pokemon in general are handy for this set due to the prevalence of Primal Ground and Ground-type coverage.</p>"

  "Hoopa-Unbound": {
    "overview": "<p>With fantastic base stats and a large movepool with a wide range of coverage options, Hoopa-U is difficult to switch into and has an excellent matchup against stall. Despite that, however, its viability should not be overestimated, as stall is the least solid playstyle in Ubers and Hoopa-U is vulnerable to all forms of status and entry hazards. In addition, Hoopa-U is hindered by its mediocre Speed and pathetic Defense, which leaves it susceptible to physical attackers and priority moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers can be used instead of Life Orb to allow Hoopa-U to stay longer on the field at a significant cost to its power; for instance, a +2 Psyshock is no longer a guaranteed OHKO on Ho-Oh and fails to OHKO Xerneas without the Life Orb boost. Wise Glasses can be used to balance power and longevity, as it still guarantees the OHKO on Ho-Oh and Blissey after a boost, with a chance to OHKO Xerneas as well. Such a set misses out on the OHKO on Extreme Killer Arceus, however. Because of Hoopa-U's naturally high offensive stats, other sets can also be attempted. A mixed set with Hyperspace Fury, Psychic, Gunk Shot, and Drain Punch can be used, taking full advantage of Hoopa-U's coverage moves, though it performs worse against stall due to its inability to achieve key KOs such as on Primal Groudon because of its lack of a boosting move. Trick Room is another interesting option that capitalizes on Hoopa-U's relatively low base 80 Speed. Choice items can also be used, though they make Hoopa-U weaker to Pursuit users. Finally, Grass Knot can be used to hit Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water harder while still dealing a decent amount of damage to Primal Groudon; however, Lugia completely walls that set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Fairy-types</strong>: Defensive Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy, Klefki, and the rare defensive Xerneas can all beat Hoopa-U one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Most physical attackers, such as Mega Salamence and Rayquaza, can take any hit from Hoopa-U and OHKO it or deal massive damage back even with moves that do not receive STAB due to Hoopa-U's pitiful defenses.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Common physical priority moves, such as Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch, deal massive damage to Hoopa-U. Users of such moves include Mega Lucario, Extreme Killer Arceus, Rayquaza, Giratina-O, and Deoxys-A.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Arceus Formes</strong>: Swords Dance Ground and Arceus-Ghost can OHKO Hoopa-U with their STAB attacks, while Adamant Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus has a chance to do so as well.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Common Choice Scarf users can deal with Hoopa-U very easily; for example, Choice Scarf Xerneas and Genesect can OHKO Hoopa-U with Moonblast and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Both offensive and defensive variants of Primal Groudon can take an unboosted attack from Hoopa-U and OHKO it in return, even without any Attack investment.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: While offensive Yveltal can't directly switch into a +2 Focus Blast, it can heavily damage Hoopa-U with Knock Off, Sucker Punch, or Foul Play if given a free switch in.</p> <p><strong>Mega Diancie</strong>: Mega Diancie outspeeds Hoopa-U and has a high chance of OHKOing it; however, it has to be wary of taking a Life Orb-boosted Psyshock before Mega Evolving.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: The occasional maximum Speed Ho-Oh is able outspeed and OHKO Hoopa-U, while Hoopa-U cannot OHKO it with anything when unboosted.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot makes this set extremely deadly, turning Hoopa-U into a powerful wallbreaker after just a single boost. Psyshock and Dark Pulse hit a majority of the tier at least neutrally; Dark Pulse also destroys defensive walls such as Lugia, Giratina-O, Mega Sableye, and bulky Arceus formes. Psyshock is used over Psychic in order to deal specially bulky Pokemon, such as Blissey and Ho-Oh, a large amount of damage. Focus Blast hits Tyranitar and Yveltal, which otherwise wall this set, and a +2 Focus Blast is even able to OHKO Chople Berry Tyranitar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature allows Hoopa-U to OHKO Blissey, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Xerneas before a Geomancy boost, as well as Primal Groudon with maximum Special Defense investment after Stealth Rock damage; the EVs also allow Hoopa-U to OHKO Chople Berry-lacking Tyranitar with maximum Special Defense under sand. The remainder of the EVs are put into Speed to outspeed most Primal Groudon sets and Xerneas without a Choice Scarf. A Timid nature can also be run to outspeed neutral-natured Pokemon with base 90 Speed and full Speed investment, but a Modest nature is usually preferred, as this set functions best against stall. Life Orb is used to boost Hoopa-U's damage output while allowing it to switch moves, capitalizing on its coverage options. 29 HP IVs can be used to minimize Life Orb recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Hoopa-U is very frail, try to bring it in via a double switch or with pivot moves such as U-turn and Volt Switch. However, do not switch it in to powerful physical or special attackers, as even with a relatively high Special Defense stat, Hoopa-U is unable to reliably survive moves like Latios's Draco Meteor. Opposing Yveltal, if given a free switch in, can deal massive amounts of damage to Hoopa-U, so try to catch it on the switch. As Hoopa-U's worst matchup is against offense, it can be used as fodder to bring a teammate in safely or as a check to some special attackers, such as Dialga and Mega Mewtwo Y; Hoopa-U should not be played conservatively against such teams. It can also heavily damage Primal Groudon, as even fully specially defensive variants are 2HKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse, and check Extreme Killer Arceus, as an unboosted Extreme Speed cannot OHKO Hoopa-U. Against stall teams, Hoopa-U is best used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker, paving the way for a teammate to sweep late-game. Hoopa-U can also act as a late-game sweeper after its checks and counters have been removed, as it finds itself with many setup opportunities when against stall.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Hoopa-U's middling Speed and atrocious Defense leave it with few chances to directly switch in, Scizor, Landorus-T, Zekrom, and Yveltal make for good teammates, as they can pivot Hoopa-U in against something it checks, such as physically bulky Pokemon like Skarmory. However, the aforementioned Pokemon do not typically offer much defensive synergy or general team stability, although Zekrom can check Yveltal for Hoopa-U and Scizor can take on Fairy-types, notably Mega Diancie. Other Fairy-type checks that pair well with Hoopa-U include Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Klefki; the latter is especially appreciated, as it can paralyze faster threats to aid Hoopa-U in wallbreaking. Pokemon that can take on physical attackers, such as Skarmory, bulky Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, and bulky Arceus formes, are mandatory. Pokemon that perform well against offense, such as Choice Scarf Xerneas and Darkrai, also make for good teammates. In addition, late-game cleaners can take advantage of Hoopa-U's wallbreaking to sweep late-game. Double Dance Primal Groudon and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground especially appreciate Hoopa-U's ability to break through Lugia and Giratina-O.</p>"
