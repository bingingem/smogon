    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefable can run Unaware over Magic Guard to counter a variety of setup sweepers such as Necturna, Dragonite, Garchomp, Weavile, and Cawmodore. However, it is usually outclassed by Arghonaut, which has phazing and better physical bulk, in this regard. Additionally, the Toxic and entry hazards immunity that Magic Guard provides is usually worth more than running Unaware. Clefable can run Calm Mind on its utility set if its team needs both Stealth Rock and a secondary win condition, but this set compromises on both sweeping power and utility. Also on its utility set, Clefable can run Sticky Barb along with Trick to cripple Heatran, Toxapex, Equilibra, and Corviknight. However, Trick lacks the consistency of Knock Off and can sometimes neuter Clefable if it receives an unwanted item, such as an Assault Vest from Galarian Slowking. Encore can be run on the utility set to reduce Clefable's tendency of being setup fodder while allowing it to essentially win against any opposing Calm Mind Clefable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Melmetal, Scizor, Equilibra, and Ferrothorn are all good answers to Clefable, as they take little to no damage from Moonblast and force Clefable out with strong Steel-type STAB moves. Kartana does the same, but takes far more from Moonblast. None of these Pokemon enjoy switching into Flamethrower, however.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Heatran, Astrolotl, Volcanion, Victini, and Volcarona all can come in on Clefable's Moonblast and force it out. Heatran can trap, taunt, and KO Clefable before it gets the chance to setup; Astrolotl can spam Fire Lash until Clefable is forced to switch and is very difficult to wear down; Victini and Volcanion force Clefable out with their nuclear STAB options; and Volcarona can setup alongside Clefable and beat it one-on-one. However, all of these Pokemon must beware Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Urshifu-R, Weavile, Tapu Lele, and Rillaboom can overwhelm Clefable and not allow it to switch in due to their immense offensive strength. Rillaboom in particular is a threat, forcing Clefable out with a roll to OHKO with Wood Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types such as Toxapex, Venomicon, Venomicon-E, and Galarian Slowking take little from any of Clefable's options and can force it out. It should be noted that Galarian Slowking and Venomicon must be wary of Knock Off, and Galarian Slowking cannot beat Calm Mind Clefable in a one-on-one. Moreover, the former three must be careful of getting hit by Thunder from Calm Mind sets.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Clefable excels at providing a myriad of utility options to teams while acting as a solid defensive Pokemon due to its typing and bulk. Clefable is a great user of Stealth Rock, as it can take advantage of free turns versus passive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Knock Off is the best option for the final slot to cripple Moonblast switch-ins such as Venomicon and Heatran, but Thunder Wave is an alternative choice to paralyze Pokemon less bothered by Knock Off like Venomicon-E, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. The given EV spread allows Clefable to survive a +2 Earthquake from Garchomp, with the rest invested in Special Defense to better answer Dragapult. Alternatively, if Dragapult is already checked on a team, Clefable can run maximum investment in HP and Defense in order to check threats like Weavile and Pajantom better.</p> <p>Corviknight and Toxapex are excellent teammates for Clefable, as they can switch in on the physical wallbreakers that Clefable cannot handle such as Weavile, Melmetal, and Urshifu-R. Along those lines, Astrolotl, Venomicon, and Earthquake Galarian Slowking make great teammates, as they can consistently switch in on defensive Heatran and force it out, though Astrolotl must be wary of Toxic. Pokemon such as Equilibra and Venomicon-E can take advantage of Clefable's passivity, so teammates like Slowbro and Zapdos are appreciated for being able to check these Pokemon. Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Equilibra, and Garchomp are helpful for threatening Heatran, weakening opposing Equilibra, and for pressuring defensive Poison-types such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking; moreover, the former two Ground-types form reliable hazard cores with Clefable by providing Defog and Rapid Spin, respectively. Finally, if Clefable is running Thunder Wave, Hex Dragapult is an excellent teammate, capable of punishing the special walls that otherwise answer Clefable such as Toxapex and Heatran.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Due to Clefable's excellent defensive typing and good natural bulk, Clefable's Calm Mind set can quickly turn into an issue for the enemy team, with very little being able to meaningfully pressure it once it starts setting up. The final moveslot depends on the team. Flamethrower is used for hitting Equilibra, Melmetal, and Ferrothorn super effectively, while Thunder is mainly for Toxapex, which can otherwise use Haze, and Heatran. Knock Off can be run over a coverage move to cripple Pokemon like Heatran, Equilibra, and Galarian Slowking for itself and its teammates, though this decreases Clefable's sweeping potential. Similarly, Trick in conjunction with Sticky Barb can be used to further maim one of Clefable's checks, though this lacks the consistency of Knock Off. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it enables Clefable to be a strong late-game sweeper, but Leftovers is an option that allows Clefable to be a more effective wall before it sets up. 60 Speed EVs let Clefable outspeed uninvested Corviknight and slower Pokemon like Venomicon and Equilibra; however, one can put those EVs into Defense instead to be a sturdier defensive pivot.</p> <p>Clefable appreciates teammates such as Astrolotl and Garchomp that can take care of Heatran, which otherwise hard walls sets running Flamethrower. It additionally needs teammates that can switch in on Venomicon-E's Gunk Shot and Melmetal's Double Iron Bash, which Ferrothorn and Zapdos do well. Clefable pairs nicely with Heatran, Equilibra, and Corviknight, which can come in on opposing Equilibra's Doom Desire. In return, Clefable is a solid answer to Zeraora. Heatran deserves special mention for being able to trap and KO Toxapex, which otherwise can Haze stall Clefable if it lacks Thunder. Furthermore, Heatran pairs well with Knock Off Clefable, as it will be able to remove Toxapex's Shed Shell. Finally, Clefable should be paired with a special wall like Assault Vest Tornadus-T or Colossoil to take on special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Blacephalon that threaten it before it sets up.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowbro can run Ice Beam over Future Sight to counter Swords Dance Garchomp and apply more immediate pressure to Landorus-T, as well as denting Flying-types like Zapdos as they switch in; this is especially useful for sets that drop Scald for Body Press.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Dragapult, Blacephalon, Aegislash, and Pajantom can easily threaten Slowbro out. Pajantom is an especially effective switch-in, as Comatose prevents Scald burns and it shrugs off damage with its good Special Defense. Dragapult and Aegislash can switch into Slowbro in a pinch, but are more easily worn down.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zeraora, Zapdos, Rotom-W, Krilowatt, Tapu Koko, Arctozolt, and Magnezone can all scare Slowbro out with their strong STAB attacks; however, Zeraora can't cleanly OHKO Slowbro and must risk a Scald burn unless Slowbro is in range of its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Tapu Lele, Galarian Moltres, and Nidoking can force Slowbro out with their strong special attacks. Tornadus-T, Calm Mind Tapu Fini, and Galarian Slowking also match up well versus Slowbro, but offer less immediate pressure. Volcanion, despite Slowbro resisting both of its STAB moves, fares surprisingly well against Slowbro due to Water Absorb and its high damage output.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Kartana and Pyroak both threaten Slowbro greatly, especially if Pyroak is running Giga Drain, but Kartana cannot safely switch in because of its pitiful special bulk and the risk of a Scald burn. Slightly rarer options like Tapu Bulu and Rillaboom are effective answers, but must respect the threat of Scald. While also rare, Jumbao is an especially potent check because it does not fear Scald burns and can stay healthy by tracing Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Despite access to Regenerator and Slack Off, if Slowbro loses its Heavy-Duty Boots or is inflicted with Toxic, it can be overwhelmed by strong wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Melmetal, and Venomicon-E. Even the smaller incremental damage from a burn can prove troublesome for Slowbro in the long run.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Slowbro's ability to check some of the tier's strongest wallbreakers while supporting its offensive teammates with Future Sight and Teleport makes it one of the most reliable pivots for bulky offense and balance teams. FuturePort enables teammates like Urshifu-R, Weavile, and Kartana by threatening their checks with a Future Sight and granting them safe entry with Teleport. Scald immediately threatens Pokemon weak to it like Landorus-T and other physical attackers with a burn, but Body Press can be used in tandem with Colbur Berry to turn Slowbro into a decent Weavile check. However, Heavy-Duty Boots is usually preferred as its item to stay healthy and switch into opposing wallbreakers even if entry hazards are on the field. Rocky Helmet is also an option to further punish physical attackers, especially those with multi-hit moves like Melmetal and Urshifu-R. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs makes Teleport as slow as possible and underspeeds, or at worst ties, Slowking and opposing Slowbro.</p> <p>Offensive Fighting- and Dark-types have great synergy with Future Sight because it lets them break past their respective Poison- and Fighting-type defensive switch-ins; Urshifu-R, Galarian Zapdos, and Weavile benefit greatly from Slowbro's Future Sight. Other wallbreakers like Dragapult, Melmetal, and Kartana can take advantage of Future Sight to break through common switch-ins like Toxapex. Landorus-T is a fantastic defensive teammate for Slowbro, especially its Colbur Berry set, as it checks Electric-types like Zeraora and Tapu Koko while benefiting from Slowbro answering Urshifu-R and Weavile. Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Buzzwole are great partners for handling Kartana and less common Grass-types like Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu, with Buzzwole even being able to take advantage of Future Sight. Teammates such as Clefable, Heatran, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T can help shore up Slowbro's weakness against special wallbreakers like Dragapult, while the latter and Astrolotl each make strong Regenerator cores with Slowbro that have great staying power. Ferrothorn is another fantastic partner, able to check Weavile if Slowbro is not Colbur Berry while Slowbro can take on Urshifu-R and Fire-types like Heatran and Astrolotl.</p>"

Without its Heavy-Duty Boots, Zapdos becomes far less reliable in dealing with these threats in the long term and is much more prone to being offensively overwhelmed.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While some Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp struggle against strong Hurricanes from offensive Zapdos sets, they have little to fear from defensive variants lacking Toxic and can still effectively stop Zapdos from pivoting when played aggressively. Colossoil does much the same, but performs even better into defensive sets because Toxic activates its Guts boost. Other Ground-types like specially defensive Hippowdon and Gastrodon are strong counters to any Zapdos set, though they don't enjoy Toxic either.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, Heatran, and specially defensive Clefable can usually pivot into Zapdos with ease. Galarian Slowking is especially effective due to Regenerator providing free health with every interaction.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Syclant, Arctozolt, and Weavile are massively threatening to Zapdos and can easily force it out; however, they can't safely switch in due to Heat Wave, and Syclant can even become inflicted with paralysis if it uses U-turn on Zapdos carelessly.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Nihilego, Tyranitar, and Stratagem can switch into Zapdos's Flying- and Fire-type moves freely and force it out with their STAB options, while the former two have the bulk to withstand Zapdos's Electric-type STAB. However, the latter two must respect the threat of Toxic on defensive sets, and all three don't want to be paralyzed by Discharge.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Common Toxic users like Landorus-T, Colossoil, Hippowdon, and occasionally Zeraora and Melmetal can permanently limit Zapdos's defensive value by inflicting it with status.</p>",

Discharge is necessary for reliably answering Flying-type like Venomicon, Venomicon-E, and Tornadus-T while enabling Zapdos to spread paralysis multiple times per game in conjunction with Static, although Volt Switch can be chosen instead if one values its ability to regularly grab momentum. Hurricane is an option that lets Zapdos pressure common Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp better at the cost of being unable to significantly threaten Heatran and bulky Water-types. Heat Wave is vital to answer Steel-type like Equilibra, Kartana, Melmetal, and Cawmodore. Toxic is a strong option for Zapdos against foes like Astrolotl, Tapu Koko, and Landorus-T; however, Defog provides valuable role compression for many teams, although Zapdos still tends to be crippled by Knock Off and Toxic from common Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T in the process. 20 Speed EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed Modest Volcanion and Adamant Bisharp, while the rest of its EVs maximize its physical bulk for attackers like Kartana, Cawmodore, and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Zapdos's ability to spread paralysis with Discharge and Static is heavily appreciated by its teammates, especially slower wallbreakers like Melmetal, Volcanion, and Tapu Lele that may be easily revenge killed otherwise. Because Zapdos is a good answer to Kartana, Rillaboom, and Tornadus-T, Urshifu-R and common Ground-types like Landorus-T are effective teammates. Ferrothorn is another good partner that can ease Zapdos's burden in checking offensive Grass-types, with Ferrothorn also acting as a servicable answer to Ice-types like Weavile and Arctozolt that would trouble Zapdos. It's incredibly common for Zapdos to be hit with Knock Off by a Pokemon like Zeraora, Landorus-T, Kartana, or Tornadus-T early in the game, so having a Knock Off absorber or secondary answer to some of these Pokemon like Clefable is advisable. Defog Zapdos also has a particularly difficult time against defensive Ground-types, so teammates that easily pressure them like Weavile, Venomicon, and Tapu Fini are good to have around.</p>"

Heat Wave is also necessary to prevent opposing Cawmodore from successfully sweeping. The given EV spread allows Zapdos to always tank +6 Cawmodore's Acrobatics, outspeeds Timid Volcanion, and puts the remainder in Special Attack to hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Pokemon like Heatran, Galarian Slowking, and Tyranitar will often attempt sponging Zapdos's attacks, so teammates such as Landorus-T, Colossoil, and Urshifu-R that can pressure these Pokemon out are good partners.

However, this leaves it outsped by common revenge killers like Stratagem and Dragapult, even after a Dragon Dance, and forfeits crucial coverage. Dragonite can run a support set with Ice Beam, Earthquake, Roost, and one of Defog or Heal Bell on bulky teams that struggle to deal with Heatran and Urshifu-R; however, Corviknight is generally superior as a defensive Flying-type due to its better bulk, Toxic immunity, and access to U-turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Weavile can effectively revenge kill Dragonite with Triple Axel or Ice Shard if Dragonite's Multiscale has been broken. Hail teams perform particularly well against Dragonite by threatening it with Arctozolt and breaking its Multiscale with hail chip damage. Melmetal can run Ice Punch, and it has the physical bulk to tank even boosted Earthquake. If Dragonite forgoes Dual Wingbeat, Buzzwole and Syclant check it adequately; Buzzwole can pressure it with Ice Punch and has the physical bulk to switch into Dragonite consistently, while Syclant resists all of Dragonite's attacks and can punish it with its powerful Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable and Tapu Fini do not take too much from any of Dragonite's attacks and threaten it with status, Knock Off, and their Fairy-type STAB moves. Tapu Lele, particularly Choice Scarf variants, forces Dragonite out if its Multiscale has been broken; however, it takes a good deal of damage from even Dragonite's unboosted attacks.

However, they are ineffective if Dragonite has already set up.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, Rotom-W, and Arghonaut can all comfortably switch into Dragonite. Slowbro threatens it with a Scald Burn, Rotom-W resists all of Dragonite's moves and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave, and Arghonaut, which is particularly effective at checking Dragonite due to Unaware, can remove its item with Knock Off and phaze it with Circle Throw. Toxapex can check Dragonite if it burns it with Scald; however, Dragonite is completely capable of powering through it with Earthquake if it avoids a burn.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic from Landorus-T, defensive Zapdos, or Heatran, burn from Astrolotl or Volcanion, and paralysis from Thunder Wave Clefable or Zapdos completely quash any hope Dragonite has at sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Dragonite is often asked to switch into menacing attackers like Urshifu-R and Victini due to its typing and Multiscale.

Earthquake and Ice Punch provide Dragonite with perfect coverage, allowing it to pressure common defensive foes like Landorus-T, Toxapex, and Tornadus-T while threatening offensive Pokemon like Zeraora and Dragapult as well. Dual Wingbeat can be used over Ice Punch to hit Arghonaut, Buzzwole, and Pyroak super effectively; however, dropping Ice Punch greatly worsens Dragonite's matchup against the omnipresent Landorus-T.

Tapu Fini is particularly helpful to switch into Weavile and opposing Dragon-types. Landorus-T is an absolutely amazing option to slowly wear down walls like Ferrothorn and Tapu Fini with Earthquake and Stealth Rock, poison bulky Water-types like Arghonaut and Slowbro, and switch into Pokemon like Zapdos and Scale Shot Garchomp, which can force Dragonite out before it sets up. Pivots like Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T excel at wearing down foes into range of a Dragonite sweep; Tapu Koko notably pressures bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Slowbro. Ferrothorn and Astrolotl provide Spikes support, wearing down foes like Tapu Fini and Ferrothorn into range of Dragonite's attacks. Astrolotl can also run Defog, letting Dragonite more comfortably tank Knock Off from Pokemon like Zeraora and Ferrothorn.

Choice Specs Blacephalon and Dragapult can 2HKO Galarian Slowking with Shadow Ball, though the latter requires Stealth Rock damage in order to reach this benchmark.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Pokemon like Clefable, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Tornadus-T are usually capable of removing Galarian Slowking's Assault Vest with Knock Off, greatly reducing its ability to check special attackers like Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to Galarian Slowking's low physical bulk, strong physical attackers like Melmetal, Urshifu-R, and Kartana can KO Galarian Slowking with a small amount of prior chip. Melmetal in particular is notable, as it has the special bulk to tank any of Galarian Slowking's coverage moves and threatens an OHKO with Double Iron Bash. However, these Pokemon generally require a pivot to bring them in safely due to the threat of Galarian Slowking's coverage options and their secondary effects.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Blissey can switch into Galarian Slowking, tank its Future Sight, and safely pivot into a physical attacker with Teleport, all while healing off any status it gets hit with through Natural Cure. Heatran can trap Galarian Slowking with Magma Storm and KO it if it lacks Earthquake, though it will be heavily weakened in the process. Corviknight avoids the 2HKO from Galarian Slowking's Flamethrower and can utilize Pressure to stall it. Slowking can use Galarian Slowking to set up Future Sight and use Teleport to safely bring in a wallbreaker to take advantage of Galarian Slowking.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Galarian Slowking's insane special bulk, access to Regenerator, expansive coverage, and excellent typing allow it act as an amazing check to many of the tier's special attackers such as Jumbao and Tapu Koko. Future Sight is the preferred option for the first moveslot, as it enables Galarian Slowking to support any of its more offensively inclined teammates; however, Psychic is another option that gives Galarian Slowking a more immediate offensive presence against Toxapex, Urshifu-R, and Venomicon. Flamethrower is used to hit Steel-types that resist Galarian Slowking's STAB moves like Melmetal, Equilibra, and Ferrothorn super effectively while also pressuring Weavile. The last moveslot is usually taken up by Scald, which is used to punish physical attackers that like to switch into Galarian Slowking like Zeraora, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; however, Ice Beam can be run to hit the latter two harder alongside hitting Dragapult super effectively. Earthquake can also be run in the last slot alongside a Sassy nature to turn Galarian Slowking into a situational Heatran check; however, Galarian Slowking sorely misses the ability to hit Ground-types super effectively. The given EV spread with a Calm or Sassy nature and an Assault Vest allows Galarian Slowking to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball and survive one Surging Strikes from Choice Band Urshifu-R. If the Dragapult benchmark is not necessary, however, a Modest nature can be run to increase Galarian Slowking's damage output.</p> <p>Offensive Dragon-types like Dragapult and Garchomp appreciate Galarian Slowking's ability to counter Fairy-types like Clefable and Jumbao. In return, these Pokemon can chip the bulky Steel-types that often give Galarian Slowking trouble. Physically bulky Pokemon like Melmetal, Corviknight, and Buzzwole make for excellent partners, as they can switch into the many physical attackers that threaten Galarian Slowking like Melmetal and Weavile. The latter two in particular are valuable teammates for their ability to absorb Knock Off and answer problematic Ground-types like Landorus-T, with Corviknight being especially useful for slowly pivoting Galarian Slowking onto the field. Teammates like Landorus-T and Clefable also provide entry hazard support or removal, which is helpful for getting Future Sight to more easily break through walls or preserving Galarian Slowking's health. Weavile and Urshifu-R take great advantage of Galarian Slowking's Future Sight, which allows them to break through physically defensive walls like Toxapex more easily.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Garchomp is CAP's premier wallbreaker, being able to sweep teams with its great STAB combination, above average Speed, and Swords Dance to boost its already stellar Attack. Scale Shot makes it nearly impossible to revenge kill, especially thanks to its good natural bulk, while also doubling up as a decently strong STAB move. Fire Fang allows Garchomp to break past the few Pokemon that resist its STAB combination, namely Corviknight, Equilibra, and Jumbao, while also being an effective tool to handle Ferrothorn. Stone Edge is an option to immediately dispose of Flying-types such as Mandibuzz and Zapdos. Leftovers provides more longevity, while a Life Orb boosts Garchomp's firepower and lets it blow past Clefable and Equilibra.</p> <p>Garchomp is a very self-sufficient Pokemon, helping its teammates moreso than getting help from them. Regardless, Future Sight support from Slowking or Slowbro is appreciated to prevent physical walls such as Tomohawk and Arghonaut from immediately switching in. Jumbao is another good partner, breaking past physical walls with its strong special attacks and potentially providing Drought for a stronger Fire Fang or Healing Wish support. Stealth Rock setters like Heatran and Tyranitar can take Ice-type moves to cover one of Garchomp's core weaknesses. Heatran also covers the Fairy-type matchup and can use Taunt on walls such as Tomohawk and Zapdos to prevent them from recovering their HP. Because Rillaboom can revenge kill -1 Defense Garchomp, Zapdos and Corviknight are good to resist its Grassy Glide, and they can also provide Defog. In return, Garchomp offensively checks Heatran, which threatens both of them. In hyper offense builds, Volcarona and Cawmodore both form good wallbreaking cores with Garchomp, with Volcarona disposing of Garchomp's checks in Jumbao and Tomohawk while Garchomp breaks through Heatran and Blissey. Cawmodore and Garchomp overwhelm their shared checks through repeated hits.</p>"

      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Defensive Garchomp has a great defensive typing, great natural bulk, and good Speed, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock quite comfortably despite not having reliable recovery. Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet hurt contact-reliant physical attackers such as Zeraora and Rillaboom as well as U-turn and Knock Off users like Tornadus-T. Toxic allows Garchomp to cripple common entry hazard removers such as Tomohawk, Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T, which are immune to Earthquake, and the bulky Water- and Ground-types that want to switch into it. Endure works extremely well with the poison and contact damage that Garchomp deals. Another option is Rest, which gives Garchomp longevity while also turning it into a pseudo-status absorber against various foes it switches into, such as Heatran and Toxapex. Alternatively, Dragon Tail phazes foes and forces them to take damage from Stealth Rock. Fire-type coverage can be run to hit Steel-types such as Equilibra and Corviknight, which are otherwise immune to Garchomp's moveset and can remove Stealth Rock for free as it switches out. 120 Speed EVs with an Impish nature allow Garchomp to outspeed Adamant Rillaboom, while a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Jolly Rillaboom, Timid Heatran, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Defensive Garchomp appreciates Knock Off support to get the most mileage out of its Stealth Rock by removing foes' Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Ferrothorn and Arghonaut both have Knock Off and appreciate Garchomp pressuring Defog users so they can set up their own hazards. Garchomp struggles against Fairy-types, so partners like Heatran, Corviknight, and Scizor are appreciated. Blissey is a great partner that can provide cleric support and sponge the commonly special Ice- and Dragon-type attacks Garchomp fears. In exchange, Garchomp can take on the physical attackers that threaten Blissey and most likely chip them as they make contact with it. Bulky Water-types like Slowking and Arghonaut and Flying-types like Tornadus-T all appreciate Garchomp checking Electric-type pivots such as Zeraora and Zapdos extremely well.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb can be utilized on hyper offense builds to boost Swords Dance Weavile's damage output to astounding levels, being able to break past typical checks, such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex, with even the smallest chip damage. However, a weakness to hazards coupled with Life Orb recoil means that it often lacks the longevity that is necessary on more balanced or bulky teams. Wide Lens sets can mitigate the unpredictability of Triple Axel, giving it near-perfect accuracy. Unfortunately, its lack of longevity and boosting power to the crippling level which Life Orb does pose more issues.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Due to its defensive typing, willingness to absorb Knock Off, access to reliable recovery, and its ability in Unaware, Arghonaut is the perfect check to Weavile, being able to easily take any hit it throws out and OHKOing it with Circle Throw or taking the opportunity to set Spikes. Buzzwole is a more offensive check that, if kept healthy, is very valuable versus Weavile. Urshifu-R can take a hit from Weavile and OHKO it back.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Tapu Fini's bulk and defensive typing lets it heavily threaten Weavile, with Choice Scarf variants in particular being especially valuable, as they can outspeed and OHKO Weavile while still having ample opportunities to switch in to. However, it must be wary of having its item removed via Knock Off, and its lack of reliable recovery makes it a poor check for the long term. Physically defensive Toxapex, especially one that has had its item removed, is a good check to Weavile, being able to remove its Swords Dance boosts with Haze and pressure it with the threat of a Scald burn. Colbur Berry Slowbro with Body Press is a niche but viable option.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory all do not outright get KOed by Weavile and are able to OHKO it back with Body Press should they carry it, but they are prone to being chipped down through entry hazards and must be carefully preserved. These Pokemon can also punish Weavile's Triple Axel with either Rocky Helmet or Iron Barbs in the case of Ferrothorn. Heatran can survive any move at +2 but cannot safely switch directly in and must rely on the unreliable Magma Storm to force Weavile out. Physically defensive Magnezone can take any hit from +2 Weavile and OHKO back with Body Press, making it a last-ditch check if it's required.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Weavile's poor bulk allows it to be revenged killed by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora, which cannot switch in on it but if given a free switch in can pick off Weavile. The latter two Pokemon need to be wary of taking too much chip damage, however, as Weavile's +2 Ice Shard does sizable damage on its own. Revenankh deserves a special mention, as its Triage Drain Punch outspeeds any attack of Weavile's and easily OHKOes it.</p>",

Very few Pokemon check it for the long term, as they often only need their item removed by Knock Off and minimal chip damage for Weavile to muscle past them. Weavile's biggest shortcoming is the unreliability of Triple Axel, as it has a large chance to do negligible damage, or even none at all. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Tornadus-T, Astrolotl, and Kerfluffle; however, if your team has adequate counterplay to these Pokemon, then an Adamant nature can be utilized to boost Weavile's damage output even further, giving it better chances at +2 to OHKO Clefable with Triple Axel and Dragapult and Choice Scarf Jumbao after Stealth Rock with Ice Shard.</p> <p>Due to Weavile's subpar bulk, it appreciates Pokemon which can pivot into it to allow it opportunities to set up or deal damage, such as Landorus-T and Corviknight. While it can wear down most of its common checks like Buzzwole and Corviknight in the long term, a teammate which can force progress versus these checks such as Tapu Koko or Magnezone is valued. The latter in particular is an excellent teammate for Weavile, as it can trap and eliminate Steel-types Weavile struggles against while providing a slow Volt Switch to give Weavile more opportunities to come in. Pokemon that can provide entry hazard support like Ferrothorn and Heatran are great teammates for Weavile, giving it the ability to soften its checks faster and apply more pressure.

An Assault Vest alongside Mirror Coat can be run to lure and KO Heatran; however, this has little to no use outside of that matchup. Toxic can be dropped for Magnet Rise alongside using an Air Balloon to trap and KO Equilibra and not give Landorus-T a free switch-in, but both Toxic and Flash Cannon more consistently punish Landorus-T, as Magnezone is still forced out by numerous other offensive threats, and Equilibra can use Rapid Spin on an attempted Magnezone switch to ruin this strategy. A Choice Specs set can be run to do massive damage with Electric Terrain-boosted Rising Voltage; however, this set mandates Tapu Koko as a partner and is very reliant on prediction due to the omnipresence of Electric-immune Pokemon in the tier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Colossoil all can come in on Thunderbolt and Flash Cannon and force Magnezone out with Earthquake. The former two do not appreciate getting hit with Toxic, however, and Colossoil fears Body Press. Equilibra can switch into both of Magnezone's STAB moves and Toxic; however, it does take quite a bit of damage from boosted Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Galarian Slowking completely walls Magnezone and can hit it super effectively with Flamethrower or set up Future Sight on it. Pajantom can freely switch into Magnezone lacking Flash Cannon and force it out with Earthquake. Heatran can switch into Thunderbolt and Toxic quite easily and force Magnezone out with Earth Power; however, it does not appreciate tanking multiple Body Presses. Astrolotl can switch into any of Magnezone's attacks and force it out with Stomping Tantrum, but it does not like getting hit with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Magnezone's low Speed, it is easily revenge killed by a host of threats, including Dragapult, Blacephalon, Dragonite, Volcanion, and Volcarona. These Pokemon don't particularly enjoy switching into Magnezone for fear of getting hit with Toxic or its STAB attacks, however. Pyroak can switch into any of Magnezone's moves and use it to boost with Contrary Overheat; it can even heal off Toxic with Aromatherapy.</p> <p><strong>Shed Shell</strong>: Ferrothorn and Corviknight can both run Shed Shell to escape Magnezone's Magnet Pull, rendering its niche null and void.

Thunderbolt is used to severely damage Corviknight while pressuring bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Arghonaut. Toxic is used to punish Landorus-T, Astrolotl, and Garchomp switching in, while Flash Cannon is preferable on more offensive teams to pressure Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Lele while still doing decent chip damage to Landorus-T and Garchomp. Leftovers is the preferred item to give Magnezone better longevity and defensive utility throughout the match; however, Rocky Helmet is an option to punish Venomicon-E, Knock Off from Weavile, Double Iron Bash from Melmetal, and U-turn from Corviknight. The given EVs allow Magnezone to outspeed Arghonaut while doing as much damage as possible with Body Press.</p> <p>Weavile is the most notable teammate for Magnezone, as it very much appreciates Ferrothorn being removed from battle. Weavile also enjoys Magnezone forcing damage onto Corviknight and pressuring Tapu Fini with Thunderbolt. Other Pokemon that struggle with Ferrothorn like Tapu Lele, Pajantom, Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and Nihilego appreciate Magnezone as a teammate. Due to Tapu Lele's strength, it is particularly good at baiting in Steel-type foes for Magnezone to trap. Magnezone often invites in Landorus-T, so Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Urshifu-R that take advantage of this are excellent choices. Landorus-T can bait in Ferrothorn and Corviknight and pivot into Magnezone with U-turn on them; Landorus-T additionally enjoys Magnezone checking Weavile and Venomicon-E.

It can run Heavy Slam on both its offensive and defensive set to more reliably KO certain Fairy-type foes it has trapped, such as Clefable and Tapu Lele. Heavy Slam also more reliably defeats Pokemon like Weavile, Blissey, and Galarian Slowking, but its other options are better in more scenarios. Heatran can also run Protect on its defensive set to scout Choice item users, gain a turn of Leftovers recovery, and rack up status damage, but dropping Toxic means it will be unable to status foes itself. Although more niche, Will-O-Wisp cripples Landorus-T and Garchomp on the switch. Flame Body over Flash Fire invalidates Jumbao as a counter, as it relies on Trace, while also potentially punishing U-turn users in Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Corviknight, but dropping Flash Fire means that Heatran cannot reliably check Volcarona.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Venomicon and Galarian Slowking can switch into Heatran while taking minimal damage and proceed to threaten it with Earth Power and Earthquake, respectively. Venomicon can be easily chipped, however, while Galarian Slowking's Earthquake is only strong enough to 2HKO Heatran. Jumbao uses Trace and its Ground resistance to wall Flash Fire Heatran, but rare Flame Body sets heavily damage it with Fire-type moves, and Toxic cripples it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon can all come in on Heatran and threaten to OHKO it with Earthquake, thereby immediately forcing it out. The latter is especially notable for having reliable recovery in Slack Off. However, none of these Pokemon appreciate getting hit with Toxic. Colossoil deserves special mention here for receiving a power boost if hit with Toxic on the switch, thanks to Guts.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Arghonaut, Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Swampert, and Shed Shell Toxapex can all easily switch into Heatran and damage it with super effective moves. The former two dislike being poisoned and have to be careful of getting worn down too quickly, though. While Gastrodon is more niche, it deserves special mention here for having access to Recover and immediately forcing Heatran out with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types</strong>: Dragonite and Pajantom are both amazing answers to Heatran. The former takes little to nothing from Magma Storm, is immune to Earth Power, can heal off Toxic with Heal Bell, and has Roost to recover any lost HP. The latter is immune to Toxic thanks to Comatose and threatens an OHKO on Heatran with Earthquake. Astrolotl can switch into non-Air Balloon Heatran and threaten it with Stomping Tantrum.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Fighting-types</strong>: Galarian Zapdos and Urshifu-R cannot consistently switch into Heatran, but they force it out with strong, super effective STAB moves.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With its combination of great natural bulk, uncontested utility options, and a useful ability in Flash Fire, Heatran cements itself as an exemplary stallbreaker and blanket check of the CAP metagame. Courtesy of its high Special Defense, Heatran is able to check prominent special attackers such as Dragapult, Zapdos, and Tapu Lele; furthermore, due to its typing and ability, it completely walls Pokemon like Clefable and Volcarona. Magma Storm allows Heatran to trap and chip bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Toxapex, as well as specially defensive titans like Blissey and Galarian Slowking. Taunt prevents these walls from recovering their health or, in Slowbro and Blissey's cases, from using Teleport, ensuring that Heatran effectively wears them down over time and eventually KOs them. Earth Power super-effectively damages opposing Heatran, as well as Astrolotl and Krilowatt, relatively common switch-ins to it. Toxic and Stealth Rock are interchangeable in the last moveslot, though the former is usually preferred to wear down particularly sturdy answers to Heatran in Gastrodon and Swampert. However, Heatran is still an effective Stealth Rock setter, forcing out a common Defogger in Corviknight.</p> <p>Heatran relies on Leftovers for recovery; therefore, Knock Off absorbers like Clefable and Corviknight make for excellent teammates. The latter is especially notable for switching in on common Ground-types like Landorus-T and Hippowdon with impunity. Landorus-T itself is also an effective Heatran partner, switching into Garchomp and freeing it up to run Toxic. It is essential to pair Heatran with defensive Water-types such as Toxapex and Slowbro, as they wall Galarian Zapdos, Venomicon-E, and Urshifu-R, which easily OHKO Heatran. Toxapex in particular also matches up very well against Buzzwole. Additionally, offensive Grass-types like Jumbao and Rillaboom make for amazing partners; Jumbao and Heatran each resist every type the other is weak to, while Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain not only significantly weakens Earthquake, but also provides Heatran with an additional source of much-needed recovery. Weavile comes in on and immediately threatens the aforementioned Ground-type checks, as well as Dragon-types that Heatran struggles against such as Dragonite and Pajantom.

Air Balloon dissuades Landorus-T from switching into Heatran even more, as well as shutting down Astrolotl and opposing Heatran while intact. While Leftovers could also be run, Air Balloon is almost always superior here for its exclusive ability to practically invalidate checks and enable more offensive progress than usual. Magma Storm lets Heatran trap and chip its switch-ins, in addition to providing a strong attack even when Heatran is at low HP, which drastically reduces Eruption's power. Earth Power helps wear down switch-ins like Tapu Fini, Toxapex, and Garchomp more quickly and provides coverage against opposing Fire-types. A Timid nature can be considered for outspeeding Adamant Swords Dance Rillaboom, but it is generally useless outside of this benchmark.</p> <p>Heatran loses out on added bulk when running this set; as a result, it becomes more vulnerable to special attackers like Dragapult and Tapu Koko. Therefore, Equilibra and Landorus-T make for great partners, walling the latter and matching up well into the former, especially if they choose to run more Special Defense investment. A Bulky Water-type, especially physically defensive Toxapex or standard Slowbro, makes for an invaluable, mandatory Heatran teammate, effectively checking massive threats to it in Galarian Zapdos and Urshifu-R. Offensive Electric- and Grass-types like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, Kartana, and Rillaboom switch into and force out Pokemon Heatran struggles against, such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Slowking. It is also a good idea to pair Heatran with Dragapult or Blacephalon, as they form a potent special wallbreaking core together, greatly pressuring their shared checks in Toxapex and Tapu Fini. Choice Specs Blacephalon in particular can swiftly dispose of certain bulky Water-types that Heatran cannot, especially Arghonaut and Slowbro. Lastly, a defensive Grass-type in Ferrothorn provides extra security against Water-types in general.</p>"

Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Melmetal can all carry Fighting-type coverage to catch Ferrothorn and 2HKO it.</p> <p>*<strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Swords Dance Garchomp and Nasty Plot Galarian Moltres can set up on Ferrothorn to pressure it. Ferrothorn is also susceptible to being overwhelmed by the Pokemon its supposed to check such as Choice Band Weavile and Venomicon-E, especially so if it loses its Leftovers.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Ferrothorn is invaluable support with a great defensive typing and strong support movepool, making it a staple in the metagame. Stealth Rock can be run instead of Spikes on teams that can't fit it elsewhere, but its broader distribution makes Ferrothorn running Spikes preferred. Body Press takes advantage of this set investing in Defense and hits Magnezone on the switch, threatens Equilibra and Kartana, and helps against opposing Ferrothorn. Gyro Ball allows Ferrothorn to hit Tornadus-T and Venomicon-E. Knock Off is an option to pressure entry hazard removers such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Astrolotl by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. They all are common switch-ins to Ferrothorn, though, as they carry Fire-type coverage. Power Whip is a powerful STAB option that helps Ferrothorn beat Water-types such as Urshifu-R and Arghonaut and Ground-types like Swords Dance Landorus-T and Garchomp. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs should be run alongside Gyro Ball, while Impish is preferred if Knock Off or Power Whip is run.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is quite an effective glue for bulky offense and balance teams, checking common threats such as Weavile, Melmetal, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele. Wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Garchomp, both Venomicon formes, and Dragonite all appreciate Spikes support from Ferrothorn as well as it checking their revenge killers in Weavile and Tapu Lele. Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp and Heatran help stack passive damage on foes, and both can take Fire-type attacks thrown Ferrothorn's way. Tapu Fini is an excellent partner, checking Fire-types like Heatran and Astrolotl as well as Choice Band Urshifu-R and forcing all of them out. Offensive Zapdos can pressure Defoggers such as Corviknight and Tornadus-T and help Ferrothorn against Fighting-types such as Galarian Zapdos, Urshifu-R, and Revenankh, while Ferrothorn alleviates some pressure off of Zapdos by being a decent Knock Off absorber and check to offensive Ice-types.</p>"

Tornadus-T is capable of running a Nasty Plot sweeper set with Hurricane + Heat Wave and one of Weather Ball or Focus Blast, depending on if it is on a weather team or not.

Rotom-W can switch into any of Tornadus-T's moves with ease and threaten it with status and a slow Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Tornadus-T relies on its items to make full use of Regenerator.

Knock Off cripples common Tornadus-T switch-ins like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Galarian Slowking. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to recover with Regenerator while generating momentum. Heat Wave hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, Cawmodore, and Corviknight super effectively. Taunt prevents Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran from using Toxic and Stealth Rock while also letting Tornadus-T beat walls like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Clefable that rely on recovery moves. Tornadus-T is an apt Defogger, as it is quite easy to get onto the field while retaining momentum due to Regenerator and U-turn.</p> <p>Many teams enjoy the utility and pivoting that Tornadus-T provides. Wallbreakers like Dragapult, Melmetal, Blacephalon, and Venomicon-E appreciate Tornadus-T pivoting them in safely with U-turn and removing entry hazards with Defog. Electric-types like Zapdos and Tapu Koko force Tornadus-T out, so Pokemon like Landorus-T and Equilibra are excellent choices for teammates. Equilibra and Colossoil provide Rapid Spin support, effectively allowing Tornadus-T to run Taunt over Defog. Other Regenerator users like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Astrolotl make for great defensive cores that sport excellent longevity. Both Toxapex and Astrolotl appreciate Tornadus-T's ability to switch into Ground-type attacks from Colossoil and Garchomp. Toxapex additionally absorbs Knock Off and Toxic from Pokemon like Clefable and Landorus-T. Other defensive pivots like Landorus-T pair well with Tornadus-T, as together they can safely switch into and pivot out on most of the tier's offensive threats.</p>"

Heat Wave is used to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Cawmodore super effectively. Knock Off punishes common Tornadus-T switch-ins like Tapu Koko, Heatran, and Landorus-T and hits Dragapult super effectively. The given EV spread allows Tornadus-T to survive two Choice Specs Dragapult Draco Meteors after Stealth Rock while outspeeding Cawmodore. If the team already has a Cawmodore check, a spread of 252 HP / 88 SpD / 168 Spe can be run, which still outspeeds Kartana and Adamant Weavile.</p> <p>Assault Vest Tornadus-T is an excellent glue for most balance teams due to its ability to provide pivoting and Knock Off support. Entry hazard removal from Astrolotl, Landorus-T, or Colossoil is a must for any team with Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Astrolotl deserves special mention for forming a solid defensive Regenerator core with Tornadus-T, capable of effectively scouting most Choice item users. Offensive Pokemon like Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Melmetal appreciate Tornadus-T's ability to pivot them in safely with U-turn. In return, they threaten the offensive Pokemon that are capable of overwhelming Tornadus-T like Venomicon-E, Weavile, and Calm Mind Tapu Koko. Because Tornadus-T struggles to check Dragapult and Tapu Lele by itself, pairing it with a Dark-type like Weavile or Colossoil is a good idea. Tornadus-T relies heavily on its Assault Vest to answer special wallbreakers; thus, Knock Off absorbers like Clefable, Arghonaut, and Toxapex are valuable teammates.</p>"

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance sweeper set is an offensive option Landorus-T can run, but it struggles to break through common defensive walls like Corviknight and Slowbro before it gets KOed. Landorus-T can use a Choice Scarf to score surprise KOs on foes and act as a strong, fast pivot; however, it struggles from a lack of immediate power outside of Earthquake. It can also use a Substitute + Bulk Up set alongside Smack Down to dispatch of traditional Landorus-T switch-ins like Corviknight and Skarmory, but this set generally requires too much setup to be worth using. The defensive pivot set can opt to invest in Defense to better check Pokemon like Garchomp and Venomicon-E; however, Corviknight generally does this job better, as it is not forced out by Weavile and Urshifu-R. Imprison is an option on the defensive pivot set to prevent foes from setting Stealth Rock, freeing up teammates to run items outside of Heavy-Duty Boots, but giving up a moveslot for it is generally not worth the loss in utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such Tapu-Fini and Urshifu-R both force Landorus-T out with super effective Water-type attacks. Tapu Fini is immune to Landorus-T's Toxic thanks to Misty Terrain, and Urshifu-R ignores Intimidate thanks to Surging Strikes. Slowbro and Arghonaut can easily tank whatever Landorus-T throws at them; however, they dislike Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Flying-types</strong>: Defensive Flying-types such as Corviknight, Venomicon, Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and the niche Tomohawk can all come in on Earthquake and force Landorus-T to switch. Corviknight and Venomicon in particular are notable for their immunity to Toxic, though Venomicon is annoyed by Knock Off. Venomicon-E performs similarly and doesn't mind Knock Off, but is much more frail. Tomohawk, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T, meanwhile, discourage Landorus-T from using U-turn due to Rocky Helmet, Static, and Knock Off, respectively. However, Zapdos and Tornadus-T do not appreciate coming in on Toxic or Knock Off, and Toxic especially neuters Tomohawk.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Toxic users such as opposing Landorus-T, Heatran, Zeraora, and Colossoil can inflict Toxic on Landorus-T, neutering its ability to act as a pivot in longer games. The latter two can also remove Landorus-T's Leftovers with Knock Off and hurt its longevity, especially if Stealth Rock is on the field.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Weavile, Arctozolt, and Syclant outspeed Landorus-T and easily OHKO with their super effective Ice-type STAB moves. Weavile in particular can break through Landorus-T's Focus Sash with Triple Axel. Other Pokemon such as Krilowatt carry Ice Beam, which OHKOes Landorus-T after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Cawmodore</strong>: Cawmodore can easily use Landorus-T to set up with Belly Drum and sweep.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Landorus-T makes a triumphant return to the CAP metagame as a premier defensive pivot. It is stellar at entry hazard control and can run either Stealth Rock or Defog depending on the needs of the team. Defog is generally preferred as Stealth Rock is easier to fit on different teammates, but it is a totally viable Stealth Rock user in its own right as it threatens Tornadus-T with Toxic or Knock Off and beats any Astrolotl lacking Will-O-Wisp. The last moveslot is generally taken up by Toxic, which punishes Flying-types outside of Corviknight, Venomicon, and Venomicon-E from coming in on Landorus-T, cripples defensive pivots like Arghonaut, Slowbro, Buzzwole, and opposing Landorus-T, and threatens setup sweepers like Revenankh, Garchomp, and Volcarona; still, Knock Off is an option for removing Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers from the aforementioned defensive Pokemon while also hitting Dragapult super effectively. Stone Edge is a final option to punish Venomicon-E from switching in, also offering more immediate pressure than Toxic against other Flying-types. The given EV spread maximises special bulk to enable Landorus-T to switch into special attacks from Pokemon like Heatran and Tapu Koko more frequently. Slower spreads can also be run in order to give Landorus-T as slow of a U-turn as possible.</p> <p>Many Pokemon enjoy Landorus-T's ability to pivot and sponge damage. Corviknight is a notable partner, as it forms a sturdy defensive pivot core with Landorus-T and appreciates its ability to check Tapu Koko. In return, Corviknight can switch into Pokemon attempting to Toxic Landorus-T and it can come in on Weavile and force it out with Body Press. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Kartana that like being brought in via a slow U-turn make for good offensive partners to Landorus-T. Both matchup well into Water-types that threaten Landorus-T. Heatran complements Landorus-T well as a specially-defensive partner that can act as a soft Weavile check or as a powerful wallbreaker that enjoys Landorus-T's U-turn with its Air Balloon set, also forming a strong hazard core with its ability to set Stealth Rock. In return, Landorus-T can check Pokemon that bother it such as Garchomp and Encore Astrolotl.</p>"

Explosion is used as a way to preserve momentum.</p> <p>Suicide lead Landorus-T should be used exclusively on hyper offense teams. As such, a dual screens setter such as Tapu Koko or Regieleki is helpful, as both can keep Landorus-T's Stealth Rock on the field with Taunt or Explosion, respectively. Most setup sweepers enjoy Landorus-T dealing heavy damage after it sets Stealth Rock. Cawmodore deserves a special mention as a powerful sweeper that needs Stealth Rock on the field to secure an OHKO on Dragapult with Bullet Punch. Other sweepers such as Rillaboom and Hawlucha appreciate Landorus-T potentially baiting Corviknight into tanking an Explosion. Galarian Moltres and Dragonite appreciate the momentum Landorus-T gains with Explosion by providing them with a free switch-in.</p>"

Shed Shell lets Toxapex switch into Heatran and Whirlpool Tapu Fini much more comfortably. Toxic Spikes over Scald pressures grounded Pokemon that don't run Heavy-Duty Boots, like Dragapult, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Lele. Baneful Bunker can be used over Knock Off to catch physical attackers like Weavile and U-turn users such as Dragapult by surprise, though it is often inconsistent and loses out on Knock Off's great general utility. Finally, the combination of Block + Spite can be used over Scald + Haze to trap and PP stall foes like Clefable and opposing Toxapex to enable Toxapex's own teammates; however, this set forgoes much of Toxapex's general utility and is inconsistent and niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Zeraora, Tapu Koko, Zapdos, Rotom-W, Krilowatt, Magnezone, and Arctozolt are some of the most common and effective methods of threatening Toxapex. However, Zeraora and Arctozolt despise being burned, and most of these Pokemon don't enjoy losing their item to Knock Off and aren't safe switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T, Garchomp, Colossoil, and Equilibra threaten Toxapex. However, none of them are safe switch-ins, as Toxapex can survive any one hit from them and threaten back with Scald or Knock Off; Landorus-T and Garchomp especially despite this interaction.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Nidoking, and Air Balloon Heatran can immediately force Toxapex out, but these three cannot safely switch in, fearing losing their item or accruing undesirable chip damage. Venomicon can switch in on Toxapex and set up on it, though Venomicon may lose its Heavy-Duty Boots in the process. Swords Dance Kartana is one of the few physical attackers capable of threatening Toxapex, as +2 Leaf Blade has a chance to OHKO; however, it can never directly switch in and must set up first.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users like Calm Mind Tapu Fini, Cosmic Power Mew, Taunt + Magma Storm Heatran, and certain Tornadus-T variants are highly effective options at dealing with Toxapex; Taunt prevents Toxapex from using Recover and removing boosts from the former two with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Future Sight</strong>: Future Sight users like Slowbro, Slowking, Galarian Slowking, and occasionally Tapu Lele enable teammates normally walled by Toxapex such as Urshifu-R and Weavile to break past it. The former two Pokemon also do not particularly mind losing their item or being burned, making them decent switch-ins.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Toxapex is the premier defensive Water-type in the metagame. Its massive physical bulk allows Toxapex to switch into some of the tier's most threatening physical attackers such as Urshifu-R, Venomicon-E, Weavile, and Melmetal and force them out with the threat of burn from Scald and Knock Off. Beyond checking strong wallbreakers, Scald and Knock Off also allow Toxapex to not be passive and make important progress over the course of a game. Haze is necessary to check prominent setup sweepers like Weavile, Dragonite, Volcarona, and Galarian Moltres. A set with maximum Defense and Rocky Helmet is best for punishing physical attackers such as the aforementioned Weavile, Venomicon-E, and Urshifu-R; however, Black Sludge can also be run for valuable passive recovery. An EV spread of 252 HP / 124 Def / 132 SpD with a Sassy nature prevents Toxapex from being 2HKOed by Weavile's Knock Off, as well as helping it against special attackers like Dragapult by letting it survive two Shadow Balls after Stealth Rock and two Draco Meteors without entry hazards.</p> <p>Toxapex is most commonly ran on balance and certain bulky offense teams. Landorus-T is a great teammate that forms a sturdy defensive backbone with Toxapex, checking Electric-types such as Zeraora; in return, it appreciates Toxapex's good matchup against Water-types and Ice-types. Bulky Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran are strong partners, checking Psychic-types like Tapu Lele while benefiting from Toxapex dealing with Fire-types. Clefable forms a defensive core with Toxapex that is highly difficult to wear down with status, hazards, or other residual damage. Pokemon with Regenerator like Astrolotl and Tornadus-T are potent teammates that are useful for scouting opposing attackers. Kartana, especially its Choice Scarf set, is a good partner; Toxapex can often remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Kartana's Flying-type checks like Tornadus-T and Zapdos and benefit from its ability to threaten checks like Tapu Lele and Arctozolt. Finally, many offensive Pokemon such Garchomp and Venomicon-E appreciate Toxapex's ability to check Weavile, while Dragapult, Dragonite, and other Dragon-types benefit from Toxapex's good matchup into Fairy-types.</p>"

Toxic is an option on the pivot set to cripple defensive Ground-types, but it is generally not worth giving up Dazzling Gleam for.

Astrolotl and Garchomp notably can switch into Heatran, while Ferrothorn can take care of Weavile seeking to revenge kill Tapu Lele. Corviknight and Colossoil can remove opposing entry hazards, which hurt Tapu Lele's longevity. Corviknight is a particularly notable teammate, as it can pivot Tapu Lele in with U-turn on both Venomicon formes.</p>"

Defensive pivots like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T can provide Tapu Lele with a free switch, making up for its lackluster bulk. Entry hazards make Tapu Lele's task of breaking through Heatran and Ferrothorn much easier; accordingly, Spikes setters like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn and Stealth Rock users like Heatran and Garchomp are great additions. Astrolotl, in particular, is notable, as it can switch into defensive Heatran and pressure Ferrothorn with Fire Lash, while Ferrothorn consistently switches into any Weavile seeking to revenge kill Tapu Lele. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Corviknight or Colossoil is equally important, as Tapu Lele can be chipped over time by the Spikes Ferrothorn sets on it. Colossoil notably can switch into Heatran as well as Dragapult's Shadow Ball.</p>"

Nature's Madness can deal hefty damage against the aforementioned bulky foes and punishes switch-ins such as Galarian Slowking, Assault Vest Melmetal, and Ferrothorn. Taunt shuts down Toxapex, Slowking, and Blissey from recovering their HP or pivoting out with Teleport. If trapping foes is not a priority, Defog in conjunction with Scald can be run over Whirlpool and Nature's Madness, respectively; this allows Tapu Fini to act as a serviceable entry hazard remover for its team, gives it a more reliable Water-type STAB option, and lets it threaten to burn foes unaffected by Misty Terrain such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Tornadus-T.

Sacred Sword allows Kartana to get past bulky Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Defog is an option over Smart Strike on teams that require entry hazard removal that otherwise lack it, but it is a significant opportunity cost, as Smart Strike is often an excellent midground option that also hits Clefable and Tapu Lele super effectively.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kartana is most commonly found on offense and bulky offense teams. Due to its extremely poor bulk, pivots like Dragapult and Landorus-T are excellent choices for safely getting Kartana in on foes like Blissey and Tapu Fini. Dragapult threatens physically defensive walls like Zapdos and Ferrothorn for Kartana, while Landorus-T can force out Heatran and cripple Zapdos and Tornadus-T with Toxic. Air Balloon Heatran is another excellent teammate that can stonewall opposing Heatran and Astrolotl and trap and eliminate Toxapex. Pairing Kartana up with similarly menacing physical attackers like Weavile and Venomicon-E allows them to weaken their shared checks. Venomicon-E is particularly notable for its ability to guarantee damage on Zapdos. Entry hazards from Pokemon like Garchomp and Astrolotl do amazing work towards enabling Kartana to sweep late-game, particularly Stealth Rock. Both are notable choices for their ability to switch into Heatran effectively. Trick + Sticky Barb Clefable is another excellent option that excels at guaranteeing chip onto foes that normally check Kartana like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Heatran.

Life Orb is the preferred item to give Kartana a chance to OHKO Toxapex with +2 Leaf Blade; however, Protective Pads is another option that prevents Kartana having its sweep ended early by contact effects like Zapdos's Static or Heatran's Flame Body.</p> <p>Swords Dance Kartana fits best on offensive teams that appreciate the holes it creates. Because Swords Dance Kartana is easier to revenge kill, specially bulky teammates like Landorus-T and Melmetal are necessary for dealing with potential revenge killers like Dragapult, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Melmetal, in particular, is a good option that does quite well at breaking for Kartana. Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele are great offensive teammates that threaten revenge killers like Zeraora and Dragapult and physical walls like Buzzwole.

Expanding Force is an option when teamed with Tapu Lele, capable of outdamaging Shadow Ball against neutral targets and OHKOing Toxapex and Arghonaut.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users</strong>: Choice Scarf Kartana and Astrolotl can outspeed and KO both Blacephalon sets.

Priority attacks such as Urshifu's Aqua Jet and Colossoil's Sucker Punch threaten to OHKO Blacephalon.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Assault Vest Tornadus-T, specially defensive Landorus-T, Venomicon, and Pyroak are bulky enough to take a hit and force Blacephalon out, though they cannot always switch into Choice Specs. Blissey is a strong check to Blacephalon with its raw bulk and Ghost immunity; Trick can be a useful way to cripple it, but costs Blacephalon its long-term power. Tyranitar is capable of checking Blacephalon thanks to its typing, stats, and Sand Stream, but it lacks longevity.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Leftovers Tapu Fini checks Blacephalon through its typing and stats, though it must be careful of Choice Specs Shadow Ball. Arghonaut is a good answer to the Choice Scarf set and ignores Beast Boost, letting it stop a potential sweep, though it also has to be wary of Shadow Ball. Toxapex can scout Blacephalon's move and switch if necessary. Gastrodon's high Special Defense, Recover, and Sticky Hold make it difficult for Blacephalon to deal with, as it fails to 2HKO with Shadow Ball and has to switch out of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Being weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to all other hazards quickly brings Blacephalon into KO range of weaker hits or causes it to faint entirely.</p>",

Trick cripples bulky answers like Toxapex and Heatran, potentially letting a teammate take advantage of them later.</p> <p>Blacephalon enjoys pairing with strong wallbreakers or setup attackers, as they can weaken Blacephalon's checks while benefitting from its ability to force out offensive answers or sweep weakened teams. Weavile can use Knock Off on common Blacephalon switch-ins like Arghonaut, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex; in return, Choice Scarf Blacephalon can help handle Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Urshifu-R uses U-turn on baited foes like Buzzwole and Slowbro, providing Blacephalon a way onto the field with significant advantage. Due to CAP's limited number of Ghost answers, Choice Scarf Blacephalon can overwhelm teams alongside other Ghost-type attackers, namely Choice Specs Dragapult and Choice Band Pajantom. Certain hyper offensive teams also appreciate Choice Scarf Blacephalon's ability to run through the opponent after the setup sweepers and wallbreakers have done their job; a good teammate is Galarian Moltres, which can come in and set up on expected Ghost-type attacks or Pokemon crippled by Trick and wears down the opponent's walls into KO range of Blacephalon.</p> <p>Strong entry hazard removal ensures Blacephalon can come onto the field and scare out fast offensive Pokemon throughout the match, so sturdy Defog users like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Corviknight are prime teammates.

Removing Leftovers from these Ground-types makes them much easier to wear down over the course of a game, allowing Zeraora more opportunities to pivot. Additionally, Knock Off notably hits Dragapult super effectively. Close Combat is the preferred option for the final moveslot, as it hits Pokemon such as Equilibra and Hydreigon super effectively, reaching a 2HKO on both. Toxic is another option that further punishes Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Jumbao for switching in on Zeraora.</p> <p>Due to Zeraora's frailty, it can find difficulty switching in. This makes it an excellent choice to add to any VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Kerfluffle, Dragapult, and Rillaboom.

Zeraora also appreciates the passive recovery from Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain. Scizor and Tornadus-T form a pivot core with Zeraora while also checking opposing Rillaboom. Defensive pivots such as Corviknight and Slowking help immensely in getting Zeraora in on stronger, frailer targets such as Weavile and Blacephalon. Slowking has the added benefit of Future Sight support, allowing Zeraora to pressure Pokemon immune to Volt Switch. Kyurem is another great choice, greatly threatening the Ground- and Grass-types that like to come in on Zeraora with STAB Ice-type moves.

Zeraora gets ample setup chances, forcing out common defensive Pokemon such as Tomohawk, Slowking, and Corviknight. Close Combat hits Heatran, Kyurem, and Equilibra super effectively, while Knock Off mainly hits Dragapult and Galarian Slowking. Blaze Kick is excellent as coverage for Jumbao but does not hit anything else meaningfully. Longevity from Leftovers allows Zeraora to sweep more easily. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option on more offensive teams, as negating entry hazard chip damage ensures one bulk up puts Zeraora out of range of Rillaboom's Grassy Glide.</p> <p>Bulk Up Zeraora fits best on hyper offense teams. Dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Regieleki lets Zeraora set up more easily and be much harder to revenge kill. Tapu Koko comes with the added benefit of powering up Plasma Fists with Electric Terrain. Rillaboom is an excellent teammate, as Zeraora appreciates Rillaboom countering Ground-types, while Rillaboom values Zeraora's ability to pressure Corviknight and Tornadus-T. Cawmodore is an excellent pairing with Bulk Up Zeraora on hyper offense teams, as it appreciates Zeraora hitting Dragapult and Tornadus-T super effectively. Bulk Up Zeraora can also operate as a wincon on more balanced offensive teams, where it appreciates teammates like Garchomp and Clefable, which excel at chipping foes into range of a Zeraora sweep.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon all wall Zeraora, block its Volt Switch, and force it out. These Pokemon also commonly run items such as Rocky Helmet, which forces chip damage on Zeraora, leaving it more vulnerable to being revenge killed. All of these Pokemon loathe getting hit with Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects</strong>: Chip damage from Rocky Helmet users such as defensive Clefable or Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn can put Zeraora in range of being revenge killed and overall decrease its ability to pivot.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon with strong priority such as Rillaboom, Miasmaw, Weavile, and Urshifu-R all can force out Zeraora, not allowing it to pivot. Rillaboom and Miasmaw in particular are notable, as they have a chance to OHKO it, while Weavile and Urshifu-R require prior chip damage to properly pressure Zeraora. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Kartana, and Victini fulfill a similar role.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types such as Jumbao, Tapu Bulu, and Amoonguss resist Zeraora's Plasma Fists and Volt Switch, and they are hard for it to wear down thanks to consistent recovery. Because of Jumbao's Trace and Fairy typing, it either resists or is immune to all of Zeraora's attacking options bar Blaze Kick, including a very useful Volt Switch immunity, making it a particularly excellent check.</p>"

Arghonaut and Slowbro despise Toxic, and Melmetal can break through Toxapex with Thunder Wave paralysis in combination with Double Iron Bash's flinch chance.

Urshifu-R appreciates Melmetal switching into and heavily damaging Tapu Fini, while Dragapult can pivot it into Blissey and Clefable. Slow pivots like Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Rotom-W also provide pivoting support for Melmetal. Landorus-T handily switches into defensive Zapdos and Blacephalon, Slowbro can take care of Urshifu-R, and Rotom-W checks Astrolotl and Heatran. Offensive Pokemon like Weavile, Kartana, and Nidoking take great advantage of the holes Melmetal creates in opposing teams. Venomicon-E pairs well with Melmetal, as together they can overwhelm their shared checks, most notably Zapdos.</p>"

Protective Pads is used to avoid any chip damage Melmetal would take from Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight and Toxapex while also avoiding contact effect abilities like Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs and Zapdos's Static. The given EV spread has enough Speed to outpace Hippowdon while giving Melmetal the ability to avoid the 2HKO from Hippowdon's Earthquake and the OHKO from Heatran's Magma Storm after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Melmetal pairs particularly well with Pokemon that appreciate Toxapex and Corviknight eliminated or at the very least heavily weakened. Weavile is a notable partner, as it takes great advantage of Toxapex being paralyzed and Corviknight being chipped. Other offensive teammates, like Dragapult, Volcanion, and Garchomp, also gain a lot from these foes being crippled. Buzzwole is a nice defensive option that takes some of the onus off of Melmetal for checking Weavile while also switching into Earthquake from Landorus-T and Saharaja. Pivoting support from defensive stalwarts like Landorus-T and Slowbro help Melmetal get onto the field; Slowbro also offers Future Sight support, augmenting Melmetal's already threatening offensive presence.

Earthquake hits Heatran, Toxapex, and Astrolotl super effectively; be careful, however, as Astrolotl commonly runs Will-O-Wisp. Ice Punch nails Landorus-T and Zapdos for super effective damage. Thunder Punch is a decent midground option that hits Slowbro and Corviknight hard. The given investment in special bulk, in conjunction with Assault Vest, allows Melmetal to avoid an OHKO from Modest Heatran's Eruption while avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Flamethrower. 12 Speed EVs allow Melmetal to outpace Toxapex.</p> <p>Assault Vest Melmetal can be easily chipped, so it greatly appreciates pivoting support from Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Colossoil.

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Defense can be used over U-turn to patch up a team's weakness to setup sweepers like Garchomp, Kartana, and Scizor, but this is usually accomplished better by Skarmory. Bulk Up similarly helps Corviknight check physical setup sweepers while also giving it a stronger offensive presence; however, Corviknight sorely misses its ability to pivot. Iron Head can be run over U-turn to hit Fairy-types like Clefable harder. However, it is noticeably weaker than Brave Bird in most scenarios, and again, Corviknight sorely misses the ability to pivot. Taunt is an option that shuts down Ferrothorn and Melmetal seeking to use Leech Seed and Thunder Wave, respectively. 200 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Modest Magnezone to avoid being trapped; however, the loss of bulk is quite noticeable. Shed Shell is an option on stall teams that prevents Corviknight from being trapped by Magnezone.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Tapu Koko and Zapdos can freely switch into Corviknight and force it out with their strong Electric-type STAB moves. Zapdos in particular is an excellent check, as Corviknight cannot safely U-turn on it due to Static. Krilowatt and Zeraora are excellent checks but may find themselves worn down after repeatedly switching in. Arctozolt is highly effective against most teams relying on Corviknight as their bulky Steel-type; however, its weakness to Body Press means it can't safely switch in more than once. Magnezone, on the other hand, stands above all other options for its ability to trap Corviknight with Magnet Pull and either KO or significantly weaken it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran, Blacephalon, Volcanion, Victini, and Astrolotl all threaten Corviknight out. The former four Pokemon offensively pressure Corviknight, while Astrolotl can use a combination of Fire Lash and Regenerator to quickly chip Corviknight's health and is one of the few entry hazard setters that Corviknight does not beat. Heatran must be wary of switching into multiple Body Presses, however.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Corviknight relies on being mostly healthy in order to operate as a defensive pivot; therefore, chip damage in the form of Knock Off or Stealth Rock from Rillaboom or Landorus-T can lead to Corviknight being overwhelmed by strong attackers like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Kartana.</p>",

Body Press deters Heatran from switching in, hits Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Equilibra super effectively, and importantly OHKOes Weavile. U-turn is the preferred move for the third slot, as Corviknight can leverage its impressive bulk and low Speed to safely pivot in a more frail teammate. Brave Bird is an option to hit Rillaboom, Revenankh, Volcarona, Arghonaut, and Urshifu-R. Corviknight's access to Pressure lets it permanently keep entry hazards off the field against Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Clefable in the long run, as well as stall powerful attackers such as Revenankh and Melmetal. Leftovers allows Corviknight to withstand Stealth Rock chip damage and switch into wallbreakers like Tapu Lele more easily; however, Rocky Helmet can be run in order to punish Weavile, Urshifu-R, and U-turn users like Landorus-T and Dragapult. The listed EV spread allows Corviknight to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Psychic after Stealth Rock and the 2HKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball from full HP. A Relaxed nature can be run in order to underspeed Scizor and opposing Corviknight in order to pivot slower.</p> <p>Corviknight has great flexibility when it comes to teammates. Defensive teams appreciate its bulk and access to Pressure, while offensive teams can take advantage of its access to U-turn. Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Colossoil are excellent choices for teammates, as they can switch into Electric-types and Heatran. In return, Corviknight deals with Weavile. Toxapex, Slowking, and Heatran are valuable teammates as well, as they can switch into the Fire-types that threaten Corviknight. Heatran in particular enjoys Corviknight keeping entry hazards off the field. Blissey, Scizor, and Clefable can help Corviknight deal with stronger special attackers like Dragapult. Strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Urshifu-R all appreciate Corviknight's ability to safely pivot them in and sponge attacks that force them out.</p>"

Dragon Dance sets are usable on dual screens teams and let Dragapult make use of its higher Attack stat, but they struggle to break Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Fini. An EV spread of 28 HP / 68 Def / 252 SpA / 160 Spe can be run to take a Bullet Punch from Cawmodore after Stealth Rock damage while outrunning Tapu Koko and maximizing overall bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Clefable and Tapu Fini can avoid a 2HKO from Dragapult's Shadow Ball and defeat it with Moonblast. Choice Scarf Jumbao has the bulk to take any one hit from Dragapult, outspeeds it, and OHKOes it with Moonblast. Other Fairy-types like Tapu Koko can switch into Draco Meteor but must be more mindful of Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Offensive Dark-types like Weavile, Hydreigon, and Bisharp take advantage of Dragapult locking into Shadow Ball and easily OHKO it in return. Bulkier Dark-types like Tyranitar and Colossoil are even better Shadow Ball switch-ins, but Colossoil faces heavy pressure from Draco Meteor and neither enjoy taking repeated U-turns.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Toxapex, Heatran, Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Venomicon, and Tyranitar are effective at taking multiple attacks from Dragapult and threatening it in return. Blissey is the closest thing to a hard counter to Dragapult but is generally a large momentum sap.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Dragapult's poor bulk and typing leaves it vulnerable to priority from the likes of Weavile and Revenankh as well as faster attackers such as Zeraora and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Fini, Tapu Lele, and Kartana.</p>",

Furthermore, its combination of U-turn and great overall coverage can make it difficult to safely play reactively against. Hydro Pump targets Heatran and bulky Ground-types like Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Equilibra, whereas Flamethrower helps immensely versus other Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn.

Dark-types like Weavile, Colossoil, and Tyranitar can take advantage of Dragapult locking into Shadow Ball and easily revenge kill it, so Steel- and Fairy-types like Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Clefable are great partners.

However, the power difference isn't very noticeable, since Syclant will usually resort to spamming Ice Beam when trying to deal damage, and the recoil taken from Life Orb reduces Syclant's longevity quite a bit. A Choice Band set with Triple Axel / Ice Shard / U-turn / Earthquake can be used to run Syclant as a physical wallbreaker, but this set isn't recommended because it fails to capitalize on Syclant's strength as a Spikes setter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Tapu Fini and Arghonaut are some of the strongest answers to Syclant, as they take little damage from any of its attacks thanks to their typings. The former can force Syclant out with Moonblast or use it to set up Calm Mind, while the latter can use Recover to heal off any damage it took and set up Spikes. Toxapex serves as a decent check, as it can switch in on Ice Beam, but Earth Power 2HKOes it after damage from Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn and Equilibra avoid a 2HKO from any of Syclant's attacks and can OHKO Syclant with Gyro Ball and Flash Cannon, respectively. Melmetal can switch in on Ice Beam or Spikes and OHKO Syclant with Double Iron Bash. However, non-Assault Vest Melmetal get 2HKOed by Earth Power, so they must be careful when switching in.

Blissey takes minimal damage from Syclant's attacks apart from U-turn, and in return it can set up Stealth Rock or use Teleport to generate momentum. Assault Vest Tornadus-T can survive an Ice Beam and revenge kill Syclant with Hurricane or Heat Wave, but it takes significant damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Because of Syclant's poor bulk and abysmal defensive typing, faster Pokemon such as Dragapult, Choice Scarf Kartana, and Choice Specs Tapu Koko can revenge kill Syclant with ease.

U-turn is Syclant's best tool for generating momentum, switching it out for another teammate and dealing solid damage in the process. Spikes is the preferred option for the last moveslot, as Syclant is a peak offensive Spikes setter, threatening common entry hazard removers such as Landorus-T and Tornadus-T.

Ground-types themselves work well with Syclant, since despite having Earth Power, Syclant is still threatened by Steel-types, so it appreciates having teammates that can reliably pressure them. Meanwhile, Ground-types benefit from Syclant's ability to take out Flying-types such as Venomicon-E and Galarian Zapdos. Syclant struggles to find opportunities to switch in thanks to its poor bulk and horrible defensive typing, so it appreciates being brought in with a pivot like Dragapult. Defensive pivots like Slowbro and Corviknight deserve special mention, as they can switch into extremely fast offensive threats that force Syclant out. Finally, physical wallbreakers like Urshifu-R, Melmetal, and Kartana appreciate Syclant's ability to pivot them in and set Spikes to wear down their checks, while they can break through special walls that can stomach Syclant's attacks.</p>"

Dragon Pulse can be used over Giga Drain to lure foes like Dragonite, Dragapult, and Pajantom, while Leech Seed improves Pyroak's overall longevity but usually isn't worth missing out on the immediate damage and ability to beat Air Balloon Heatran that Giga Drain offers.

    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Fidgit is most threatened by strong wallbreakers like Choice Specs Tapu Lele, Choice Band Urshifu-R, and Life Orb Garchomp when outside of Trick Room. Fidgit will not be able to set up Trick Room before being OHKOed, and if it tries to switch, its teammates might not be able to tank two consecutive attacks. This situation not only jeopardizes Fidgit itself but also its entire team. At best, the Trick Room team could lose a couple team members; at worst, the Trick Room team simply won't get Trick Room up again and loses.</p> <p><strong>Trapping Moves</strong>: Trapping Moves from Heatran, Tapu Fini, and Pajantom force Self-Destruct Fidgit to use the move early, or else Fidgit will waste its own Trick Room turns. This stops Fidgit from setting up Persistent-lengthened Trick Room more than once.</p>",

      "Trick Room Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fidgit's signature ability Persistent extends Trick Room by two turns, which makes Trick Room teams much more consistent. Fidgit is even bulky enough to set it twice sometimes if its HP is managed well! Having both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin is great role compression for Trick Room teams, even if Fidgit won't be able to use them in every battle. Self-Destruct provides one of Fidgit's teammates a free switch in while also chipping down the foe appreciably, giving its teammate an excellent platform to start sweeping. It also blocks opposing Rapid Spin and Defog from clearing entry hazards and conserves Trick Room turns against trappers like Pajantom, Whirlpool Tapu Fini, and Heatran. U-turn is an option over Self-Destruct, as Fidgit can pivot into one of its teammates and escape trapping without sacrificing itself. However, U-turn can either leave Fidgit with so little HP that it's useless late game or force a sweeper to take heavy damage on the switch, which means U-turn is sometimes hard to use.</p> <p>252 HP EVs and 72 Defense EVs allow Fidgit to survive a Triple Axel from unboosted Weavile, Psyshock from Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and unboosted Earthquake from Garchomp or Landorus-T. The remaining EVs in Special Defense give Fidgit the best chance to tank two of Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteors and guarantee surviving its Hydro Pump. Mental Herb is the preferred item to set Trick Room against Taunt users such as Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Tapu Fini. On the other hand, Air Balloon allows Fidgit to set up Trick Room against Ground-types, which typically have a good matchup against most Trick Room sweepers.</p> <p>Generally, Fidgit operates best alongside two other Trick Room setters. Hatterene's access to Magic Bounce, Healing Wish, and Misty Explosion make it an excellent choice, preventing entry hazards from being set up in the first place. Cresselia's immense bulk allows it to set up Trick Room against Choice Band Urshifu-R and Choice Specs Tapu Lele, which can both OHKO Fidgit. Cresselia also provides a Ground-type immunity and Lunar Dance utility. Porygon2 has a much better matchup against Ghost-types like Dragapult and Pajantom, which otherwise give Trick Room teams problems when Trick Room expires, and can safely pivot into a sweeper with Teleport. The remaining three teamslots should be dedicated to Trick Room sweepers. Venomicon is an excellent choice with Nasty Plot and Life Orb, as it's one of the few special-attacking Trick Room sweepers and also matches up extremely well against Ground-types. Melmetal runs a brutal all-out attacker set with Life Orb or Choice Band that few Pokemon can stomach, and it provides excellent defensive utility with its bulk and typing. Tapu Bulu has great synergy with Melmetal, wearing down or eliminating Zapdos, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Venomicon, providing passive recovery, and reducing damage from opposing Earthquakes. Alolan Marowak and Pyroak greatly enjoy Fidgit's extended Trick Room and appreciate Fidgit clearing Stealth Rock for them. Dhelmise is an alternative to Alolan Marowak that fares much better against Slowbro and Arghonaut and isn't nearly as crippled by Ferrothorn's Knock Off, but it is slightly less powerful and must use the more unreliable Power Whip. Slowking is an alternative bulky Nasty Plot Trick Room sweeper to Venomicon that can set up against Heatran, which commonly harasses Trick Room teams. Finally, Crawdaunt and Glastrier are decent options for Trick Room teams, but they are walled by Arghonaut, which can use them to halt the team's momentum.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball can be used over Earth Power to hit some bulky Water- and Ground-types for more damage; however, it's usually not worth worsening your matchup against Toxapex and Galarian Slowking. Stratagem can also drop Earth Power for Stealth Rock and be a dedicated lead on offensive teams, but its value as a fast cleaner and mid-game breaker is difficult to pass up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey, Slowking, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon can easily switch into Stratagem and force it out due to its lack of recovery, regardless of whether Stratagem has boosted its Special Attack or not. Galarian Slowking can switch into any move and do significant damage with Scald, but cannot beat Stratagem without prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Zeraora can switch in safely on any move except Meteor Beam, outspeed, and threaten to OHKO with Close Combat. Dragapult can threaten to OHKO with a Choice Specs Draco Meteor or Hydro Pump. Choice Scarfers such as Tapu Fini, Jumbao, Kartana, or Tapu Lele cannot switch in safely, but consistently threaten Stratagem, forcing it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Rillaboom prominently threatens to OHKO Stratagem with its strong STAB priority move, while Scizor, Syclant, and Weavile can pick-off a weakened Stratagem, but they must all be wary when switching in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Meteor Beam": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Stratagem plays the role of a fast, frail wallbreaker, with a STAB Meteor Beam. The move's Special Attack boost is much appreciated, as Stratagem often falls short of getting crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs without it. Once Meteor Beam is used, you must try to get as much mileage out of Stratagem as possible, as it loses significant wallbreaking power if it's forced to switch out and lose its boost. Paleo Wave is the STAB move of choice after Meteor Beam is used. Fire Blast hits Steel-types like Equilibra and Ferrothorn that want to switch in on a predicted Rock-type move. Earth Power is a more accurate but weaker way to handle certain Steel-types like Melmetal and importantly hits Toxapex and Galarian Slowking super effectively.</p> <p>Because Stratagem can only boost once in most games, it works best on offensive teams punching holes for its teammates or as a late-game cleaner. Teammates like Volcarona and Zeraora are great at overwhelming opposing bulky Ground-types in tandem with Stratagem. Nihilego and Necrozma form powerul Meteor Beam cores with Stratagem and enjoy its ability to weaken Steel-types and special walls, while Dragonite, Revenankh, Rillaboom, and Kartana benefit from Stratagem's good matchup into Flying-types like Zapdos. Rillaboom and Kartana also provide Knock Off utility to remove Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from the opponent's Pokemon, both of which Stratagem greatly appreciates. On less offensive teams, Stratagem relies much more on pivots to enter safely due to its low defensive stats and weakness to common types. Pivots such as Landorus-T and Dragapult can get Stratagem in on advantageous matchups so it can pave the way for them to clean up later. Finally, Spikes setters like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn dissuade the opponent from switching around Stratagem and also help it break down walls more easily.</p>"

Tornadus-T and Corviknight can each remove Arghonaut's Spikes, and will deal great damage with their Flying-type STAB; however, Tornadus-T does not enjoy losing its item. Corviknight is additionally capable of stalling out the PP of Arghonaut's Spikes and even Circle Throw. Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres are two strong Flying-type wallbreakers that can easily force Arghonaut out, though they don't want to switch into Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Future Sight</strong>: The prevalence of Slowbro and Galarian Slowking means that Future Sight is very common, which can threaten Arghonaut when it would switch in to sponge a physical hit, but they do not appreciate getting their item Knocked Off.</p> <p><strong>Strong Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Zapdos, Tapu Koko, Krilowatt, Zeraora, and Rotom-W can threaten Arghonaut with their strong STAB moves with little to no fear, especially if they are running Volt Switch, but most of them do not appreciate a well-timed Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Kartana, Jumbao, Rillaboom, and Tapu Bulu can all scare out Arghonaut, even if their item gets removed by Knock Off. Ferrothorn takes very little from Circle Throw and it can set up its own hazards, use Leech Seed, or deal great amounts of damage with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Tapu Lele can OHKO Arghonaut with any of its STAB options.

Unfortunately, Arghonaut's secondary typing makes it susceptible to Future Sight and leaves it taken advantage of by Venomicon and Venomicon-E incredibly easily, often forcing its teammates to pick up extra slack in those matchups. Moreover, Arghonaut's Water typing puts it into competition with other bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Toxapex, which have superior defensive typings and more broadly useful abilities. Arghonaut also provides a team Spikes support and can use Circle Throw to both force Spikes damage and disrupt opponents. Knock Off severely inconveniences almost any Pokemon it hits, removing the common Heavy-Duty Boots, further enhancing Spikes's damage output, while at the same time making Ghost- and Flying-types think twice before they come in to take a Circle Throw. A physically defensive EV spread is preferred to reliably answer powerful set-up sweepers such as Garchomp and Cawmodore and wallbreakers like Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Arghonaut enjoys being paired with Steel-types such as Corviknight and Melmetal, since they resist Flying-, Fairy-, and Psychic-type attacks that it is weak to, while Arghonaut takes on the various Fire-types that threaten them. In addition to these Steel-types, others like Magnezone and Ferrothorn can shore up Arghonaut's vulnerability to Venomicon-E. Heatran is a great partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock and use Toxic on Slowbro, which Arghonaut appreciates. Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Equilibra, and Garchomp dissuade Electric-types in exchange for Arghonaut checking Weavile. Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos also pair nicely, being able to deal with Kartana and other Grass-types, while Arghonaut handles Ice-type moves. VoltTurn users such as Dragapult and Tapu Koko appreciate the extra residual damage Spikes provides, and Arghonaut can remove the Heavy-Duty Boots of various walls with Knock Off.</p>"

Unfortunately, it can be very hard to justify using Cyclohm over a different Electric-type like Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W. Volt Switch is great at helping Cyclohm capitalize on its ability to force switches and lets it keep up momentum against foes like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran that it struggles to threaten, but Discharge helps it more directly deal with Water-types like Slowking and Toxapex, which can easily take a Volt Switch and heal back up with Slack Off and Recover, respectively, as well as Venomicon and Venomicon-E. Ice Beam can be run over Draco Meteor to hit Zapdos, Landorus-T, and opposing Dragon-types in one slot, though the drop in power is noticeable.

Landorus-T is also effective, but Knock Off and Toxic are annoying because it lacks reliable recovery.

Because even uninvested Earthquake is so strong, Flying-type Pokemon like Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Corviknight and other physical walls like Arghonaut, Clefable, and Equilibra tend to switch into Colossoil, which means Colossoil can rather easily use Knock Off or Toxic against them.

For example, Zapdos can freely run three attacks and Roost or defensive sets with Toxic, Tornadus-T can run Taunt or Assault Vest, and Astrolotl can run Spikes.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tomohawk's role compression, excellent bulk, and Intimidate allow it to check a myriad of physical attackers such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Revenankh. Despite these attributes, Tomohawk struggles due to how common Flying-types are in the tier and its inability to switch into some of the metagame's most common physical attackers, such as Zeraora, Venomicon-E, and Weavile. It has excellent neutral coverage with Hurricane and Aura Sphere, and these moves hit the aforementioned physical attackers it checks, along with others like Urshifu-R and Melmetal, super effectively. Tomohawk is an adequate Stealth Rock setter, though common Defoggers like Zapdos and Tornadus-T force it out. Similarly, it can utilize Rapid Spin, though entry hazard setters like Clefable and Astrolotl fear little from it, and others like Landorus-T and Heatran can cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p>While Tomohawk is a passable wall, it is incapable of checking some of the more prevalent physical attackers in the tier, such as Zeraora, Weavile, and Venomicon-E. Therefore, alternative defensive options like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos are must-haves alongside it. Equilibra and Heatran are intriguing partners that can switch into the strong Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks that plague Tomohawk; they also form nice defensive entry hazard setting and removing cores. Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Colossoil are helpful as checks to Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Zapdos, with Garchomp and Landorus-T taking some of the burden off of Tomohawk to check physical threats and Colossoil taking on special attackers like Dragapult and Heatran that pressure it. Tomohawk must be paired with a check to Flying-types, as it often invites in Zapdos and Tornadus-T; accordingly, Zapdos, Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Weavile all make for good partners.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set makes use of a unique trait that Tomohawk possesses: Prankster Haze. This lets Tomohawk act as a backstop against setup sweepers like Kartana, Garchomp, and Cawmodore. Prankster also gives Roost priority, allowing Tomohawk to check Urshifu-R by racking up Rocky Helmet chip damage and lessen the damage it takes from Zeraora's Electric-type moves. However, due to it lacking Intimidate, this set performs much worse in the face of strong physical wallbreakers like Melmetal. Haze also leaves Tomohawk with only one available moveslot to choose between Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and Aura Sphere, leaving it deficient in either its coverage or utility. Tomohawk can set and remove entry hazards on physical attackers like Kartana and Rillaboom; however, it is forced out by common Defoggers like Zapdos and Tornadus-T and Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Heatran. Alternatively, Aura Sphere can be run to not be useless against Steel-types like Heatran and Melmetal; however, this takes away from the role compression that justifies Tomohawk's use in the first place.</p> <p>HazeHawk is best used on teams that are weak to a particular setup sweeper. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Equilibra can switch into Electric-types like Zeraora and Tapu Koko for Tomohawk and appreciate it checking Cawmodore. Additionally, Landorus-T and Equilibra provide Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively, freeing Tomohawk to run Aura Sphere. Tapu Fini enjoys Tomohawk's ability to check Swords Dance Kartana and Ferrothorn, and in return it deals with Weavile. Specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Slowking, and Toxapex are excellent teammates, as they can deal with the many special attackers that threaten Tomohawk like Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T. Furthermore, this Tomohawk set is walled by Heatran if it's not running Aura Sphere, making consistent switch-ins to it like Astrolotl and Colossoil mandatory.</p>"

Weavile and Bisharp can pick off a weakened Necturna with their STAB priority moves in Ice Shard and Sucker Punch, and they can both take a boosted Giga Drain to fire off a stronger physical attack if needed.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Corviknight can take any hit from Necturna and OHKO with Brave Bird, while special attackers such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Tomohawk can take an attack and hit it back, but all are within 2HKO range. Tomohawk also has the option of running Prankster Haze to remove Necturna's boosts.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Bulky Fire-types like Astrolotl and Heatran have enough bulk to take Necturna's hits and deal heavy damage or status it, with Heatran also having Roar. Moltres can tank a hit and lower Necturna's Special Attack with Mystical Fire.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Phazing</strong>: Since Power Herb makes Geomancy pretty much single-use, Haze Toxapex and Tomohawk can effectively neuter Necturna, and both can take any boosted hit.

Geomancy opportunities aren't abundant due to Necturna's low Speed, but its good bulk lets it set up on weak non-super effective attacks and against common Choice item users like Landorus-T and Jumbao locked into their STAB moves. Giga Drain lets Necturna stay healthy thanks in part to its low base HP, making it harder to revenge kill through chip damage. Substitute is a good way to block Toxic or Thunder Wave from walls such as Blissey and Ferrothorn and safely set up if the opponent switches into something that threatens it. A Modest nature is used to maximize Necturna's otherwise weak damage output while still outspeeding Zeraora after boosting, but this leaves it slower than Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Colossoil. Psychic is an option over Substitute to OHKO Tomohawk at +2 and break past Haze Toxapex; however, this compromise leaves Necturna far easier to dispatch of in the majority of situations.</p> <p>Necturna needs to be part of a very offensive team to function best. Dual screens support from Regieleki or Tapu Koko ensures it can get an opportunity to set up. Necturna is also heavily threatened by Fire-types like Heatran and Astrolotl, so Ground-types like Garchomp are a perfect match, being able to deal with them and Toxapex alike, while Necturna can overwhelm common physical walls like Tomohawk and Clefable. Volcarona and Necturna form a good core, overwhelming their common checks in Heatran and Tyranitar with very powerful attacks, and Volcarona also appreciates Necturna using Blissey as setup fodder. Choice Scarf Aurumoth can sacrifice itself with Final Gambit to remove one of the special walls it invites in, which conveniently also block Necturna's path.</p>"

This gives Mollux a reason to be used, but it still struggles to differentiate itself from other bulky Calm Mind sweepers like Clefable and Tapu Fini and requires much more team support. Thunder Wave can be run over Thunder to more reliably punish foes like Dragapult and Galarian Slowking, but having Lava Plume as its only remaining attack is often undesirable. Mollux also has a niche on rain teams due to Dry Skin, and can run a Calm Mind or three attacks set with Black Sludge to boost both its power and longevity; still, this set can be difficult to justify over more consistent wallbreakers or defensive options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Any relevant Ground-type in the metagame can OHKO Mollux with its STAB Ground-type attack. However, the only Ground-type that can switch in safely is Colossoil, using Guts to get around Lava Plume's burn chance.</p> <p><strong>Heatran and Astrolotl</strong>: Mollux can only damage Heatran with its unreliable Thunder and gets easily forced out by Earth Power. Mollux can do decent damage to Astrolotl with Sluge Bomb and potentially poison it, but it still gets forced out by Stomping Tantrum or locked into an undesirable move with Encore.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Mollux wants to switch into foes like Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Weavile throughout a match, but it often gets its Heavy-Duty Boots removed in the process and is rendered incapable of checking them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Both Slowking and Galarian Slowking can set Future Sight on Mollux and don't fear any of its attacks. Specially defensive variants of Toxapex can switch into Mollux freely and remove its item. Blissey stonewalls Mollux and can paralyze it or use the opportunity to steal momentum with Teleport.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Tapu Lele, Pajantom, and Galarian Zapdos can force Mollux out with their STAB attacks or Stomping Tantrum in the case of Galarian Zapdos. Pajantom is especially effective because it can safely switch in on any of Mollux's attacks without fear of status due to Comatose. Rock-type wallbreakers like Tyranitar, Stratagem, and Nihilego can do much the same.</p> <p><strong>Future Sight</strong>: Pokemon that Mollux normally answers like Urshifu-R and Tapu Fini can easily break past it when backed by a Future Sight from Slowbro, Slowking, or Galarian Slowking.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mollux can be valuable for its role compression on specific teams due to its good matchup against defensive Steel-types, ability to set Stealth Rock, immunity to Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, and its unique status as a Fire-type that checks Tapu Fini and Urshifu-R. However, the upsides end there; Mollux is outclassed by and loses to other common Fire-type utility Pokemon like Astrolotl and Heatran because of its passivity and vulnerability to Knock Off. If Stealth Rock is covered elsewhere on Mollux's team, Sludge Bomb can be run instead, as it greatly appreciates the expanded coverage. However, this also decreases the range of roles Mollux can compress into a single team slot, thereby defeating much of the reason to use it in the first place. Thunder is Mollux's preferred coverage to meaningfully pressure Heatran, 2HKO Toxapex, and threaten Water-types like Slowbro and Urshifu-R that Dry Skin lets it beat, but Sludge Bomb can be run to spread poison and for a better matchup against foes like Clefable and Astrolotl. The EVs let Mollux live two Close Combats from Urshifu-R after it pivots with U-turn once, and the rest are invested in Special Attack to reduce its passivity.</p> <p>Sturdy Ground-type answers are crucial on any team with Mollux. Physical walls like Buzzwole and Slowbro are effective in this role, also taking pressure off of Mollux to answer Urshifu-R; additionally, Corviknight, Equilibra, and Landorus-T all simultaneously provide a Ground-type immunity and reliable entry hazard removal with Defog and Rapid Spin, as Mollux is highly ineffective if it loses its item and Stealth Rock is up. Teammates such as Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Colbur Berry Slowbro can absorb Knock Off, preserving Mollux's Heavy-Duty Boots. If Mollux is lucky, it can burn a greedy Ground-type foe switching in with Lava Plume; Electric-type teammates like Zeraora and Tapu Koko greatly appreciate this, also benefiting from Mollux's good matchup into Ferrothorn. Mollux is often unreliable due to having a large number of hard matchups, so make sure to pair it with consistent, versatile win conditions like Weavile or Calm Mind Clefable that can always pull their weight.</p>"

      "Final Gambit": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This Aurumoth set is exclusively seen on hyper offense builds for removing one of the opponent's walls so that its teammates can set up and sweep more reliably. Final Gambit allows Aurumoth to sacrifice itself to deal damage equal to its HP value, and very few Pokemon in the metagame can stomach it without getting OHKOed. Trick is useful in potentially crippling one of the opponent's walls if Aurumoth's HP is not enough to net a KO. Healing Wish allows Aurumoth to completely heal a teammate at low HP so that it can attempt to sweep once more. Blizzard is the sole attack, 2HKOing the two most relevant Ghost-types in Dragapult and Pajantom. Choice Scarf is necessary to outspeed as much of the metagame as possible. Maximizing HP is also important, as it allows Aurumoth to KO Arghonaut, Buzzwole, and do the most damage to Melmetal with Final Gambit.</p> <p>Strong setup sweepers such as Cawmodore, Weavile, and Volcarona are good partners, with Aurumoth paving the way for them to sweep after using Final Gambit. Victini can also run a Choice Scarf Final Gambit set to double down on the self-sacrifice route, with Swords Dance Explosion Landorus-T playing a very similar role. Dual screens setters such as Regieleki and Tapu Koko are also good teammates for the teams that Aurumoth slots into, while Alolan Ninetales does much the same as well.

When backed up by Weakness Policy and Weak Armor, Aurumoth can use its multiple weaknesses to common physical moves such as Knock Off and U-turn to instantly become a terrifying sweeper. Psyshock allows Aurumoth to hit Blissey and Galarian Slowking harder than Psychic would. Thunder OHKOes Tornadus-T and Corviknight after a boost while also dealing with bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Slowbro. Focus Blast is necessary for breaking past Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Equilibra, and Melmetal. A Timid nature is chosen over Modest so that unboosted Aurumoth can outspeed standard Colossoil as well as Modest Tapu Lele.

Dual screens or Aurora Veil support from Tapu Koko or Alolan Ninetales, respectively, gives it more opportunities to set up without being afraid of being OHKOed. With Aurumoth inviting in various Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, Bulk Up Zeraora can easily threaten or dispose of them. Mew can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock to weaken Aurumoth's checks, putting Galarian Slowking in OHKO range after taking damage from both entry hazards.

Drain Punch is the preferred coverage option, as it allows Cawmodore to beat Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran and increases its overall longevity. However, Knock Off is an option that allows Cawmodore to beat some of its potential checks like Rotom-W and offensive Zapdos. 4 EVs in HP allow Cawmodore to activate Sitrus Berry after a Belly Drum, while 24 EVs in SpD allow Cawmodore to always live an univested Heat Wave from Zapdos at full health, letting Cawmodore have a better chance at beating it using the HP recovery from Drain Punch and Acrobatics.</p> <p>Cawmodore heavily dislikes taking damage on the switch and wants to be as healthy as possible before using Belly Drum, so Pokemon that can set dual screens or Aurora Veil for it like Tapu Koko or Alolan Ninetales, respectively, are good teammates.

Furthermore, Taunt Tapu Koko can shut down and beat some of the major Defoggers in the metagame like Corviknight and Tornadus-T. Setup sweepers like Garchomp and Weavile are solid teammates for Cawmodore on hyper offense teams, as they can punch holes in opposing walls and make it easier for it to clean late-game and vice versa.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Crucibelle has a difficult time finding a place in the metagame. Its STAB combination is walled by the tier's multiple defensive Steel-types and it often lacks the power to make significant progress against a team. However, it has a niche as a Trick + Choice Scarf user that can bait in bulky Steel-types like Corviknight and Equilibra and cripple them, as well as being able to revenge kill Volcarona at +1 Speed. Stone Edge takes up the first moveslot, allowing Crucibelle to act as a solid check to Volcarona and Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Venomicon-E, and Zapdos. Trick is the main attraction of this set, used to bait in and cripple Toxapex and Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Equilibra, and Corviknight. U-turn is used to keep momentum and regain health through Regenerator. Gunk Shot hits the multitude of Fairy-types in the tier, reaching OHKOs on Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, offensive Tapu Fini, forcing out Calm Mind Clefable, and spreading Poison to foes like Landorus-T. If checking Fairy-types is not needed, Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes can be run depending on the team's needs.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Kartana and Melmetal that appreciate Crucibelle checking Volcarona and Flying-types make great partners. Crucibelle's ability to cripple Toxapex and Ferrothorn with Trick makes Dragonite, Tapu Fini, and Urshifu-R solid teammates. Crucibelle makes for a solid addition to most pivot cores, so Pokemon like Zeraora, Krilowatt, Zapdos, and Slowbro all make for excellent choices. Slowbro deserves special mention for getting Crucibelle in safely via Teleport while also providing Future Sight support. Pokemon such as Dragapult and Weavile appreciate Crucibelle pivoting them in and forcing out Fairy-types.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Venomicon are three of the most reliable counters to Kerfluffle. They are able to freely come in on resisted Fairy- and Fighting-type moves, threaten to cripple or outright KO Kerfluffle, and the former two can heal off any damage as they switch out. Venomicon-E does much the same, though it suffers from issues of frailty and vulernability to Stealth Rock. While less viable, other bulky Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Mollux are good checks as well.</p> <p><strong>Other Pokemon with Regenerator</strong>: Assault Vest Tornadus-T in particular is a great switch-in, taking little from any of Kerfluffle's moves and threatening to outspeed and KO. Slowking also doesn't fear any of Kerfluffle's moves, able to easily switch in and get a valuable opportunity to use Future Sight or Teleport. Astrolotl can switch in and scout Choice Specs Kerfluffle and then pivot to an appropriate answer, but it must be at high health to do so.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Corviknight and Scizor can both reliably switch into Kerfluffle due to their great special bulk, Fighting-type neutrality, and access to reliable recovery. Aegislash fears little from any of Kerfluffle's moves, though it's still prone to getting worn down over time. Other Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn are excellent sponges for Kerfluffle's Moonblast after it has been scouted by another teammate.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Choice Scarf users that are and capable of KOing Kerfluffle such as Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, Jumbao, and Kartana are all potent offensive checks. Even Pokemon like Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora can threaten to KO Kerfluffle with prior chip damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Kerfluffle's strong STAB combination of Fairy and Fighting along with its great offensive stats and access to Parting Shot is a compelling combination on paper; however, Kerfluffle's lacking Speed and poor perfomance against many of the tier's top walls make it an inconsistent option in practice. Moonblast is Kerfluffle's most reliable and spammable STAB move, and when paired with Focus Blast and Aura Sphere, Kerfluffle can easily bypass opposing bulky Steel-types like Equilibra and Heatran and pose a huge threat to teams that rely on these Pokemon to check Fairy-types. Despite its low-Base Power, Aura Sphere is often convenient in situations where you don't want to risk missing a Focus Blast, though Sludge Bomb can still be useful against certain Fairy-types like Clefable, Jumbao, and Tapu Fini. Parting Shot is great at grabbing momentum and safely bringing in teammates, and it also lowers the power of Future Sight from an incoming Galarian Slowking.</p> <p>Despite Kerfluffle's strengths, it ultimately struggles to break past many common Poison-types and finds itself easily revenge killed due its relative lack of OHKO power and being Choice locked into moves. Ground-types like Landorus-T, Colossoil, Equilibra, and Garchomp are generally effective partners for these reasons, as they can threaten many of the Pokemon that wall Kerfluffle's STABs. All three of these Pokemon can also remove hazards to keep Kerfluffle healthy, while Equilibra can set Doom Desire to deny Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Clefable from safely switching into Kerfluffle's Fighting-type moves. Slowbro and Slowking offer similar support with FuturePort, a strategy that has incredible synergy with Kerfluffle and is the only consistent way it can break past Toxapex and Venomicon. Another great Future Sight setter is Galarian Slowking, though it unfortunately can't use Teleport to safely bring Kerfluffle in. Spikes support from teammates like Astrolotl and Ferrothorn is great for Kerfluffle, as it can struggle to OHKO opposing Pokemon but is still good at repeatedly forcing switches; Spikes additionally help Kerfluffle break past its checks in the long run by forcing damage on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, which would otherwise be able to recover their HP through Regenerator. Slower wallbreakers that appreciate being brought in for free with Parting Shot such as Melmetal also tend to have great synergy with Kerfluffle.</p>"

Other physically bulky Pokemon such as Clefable, Corviknight, Toxapex, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn can switch into Pajantom and threaten it out if they're at full health, but they may find themselves easily worn down into 2HKO range of Choice Band Spirit Shackle. Skarmory can freely switch into Pajantom and use the opportunity to set Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Pokemon like Zeraora, Tornadus-T, Rillaboom, and Toxapex are all good users of Knock Off, with even the weakest among them still being able to deal significant damage. Pajantom isn't strong enough to reliably trap and eliminate opposing targets if it loses its item, so any Knock Off user is capable of effectively neutering it for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Anything that's capable of taking a hit from Pajantom and OHKOing in return can easily force it out.

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Pajantom's greatest strength comes from trapping and eliminating common defensive roadblocks like Clefable and Tapu Fini for teammates with Spirit Shackle, which can also punish mispredictions. Additionally, it can switch into foes like Slowking, Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Zapdos to find chances to safely wallbreak and trap foes, which makes its awkward Speed tier and need to use Choice Band less significant. Pajantom can also leverage its powerful Spirit Shackle, immunity to status, and great coverage to become a dangerously self-sufficient wallbreaker. Outrage powers through many common Ghost-type checks like Mandibuzz and Hydreigon, although locking into it leaves Pajantom extremely vulnerable to Fairy-types like Clefable and Jumbao. Earthquake is vital coverage for Pajantom, as it can score a 2HKO on certain switch-ins like Toxapex and Melmetal. Toxic can enable Pajantom to beat certain checks like Tomohawk and Buzzwole in the long run, but Ice Punch is still a good option to hit foes such as Landorus-T and Hydreigon without having to lock into Outrage. Jolly is generally the preferred nature to outspeed Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Jumbao, Hydreigon, and Landorus-T, although one might opt for Adamant to 2HKO physically defensive Clefable far more consistently.</p> <p>Pajantom is most appreciated on teams where it can significantly weaken or outright remove opposing Pokemon like Tomohawk, Landorus-T, and Clefable that would otherwise be in the way of its teammates. Zeraora and Landorus-T pair excellently with Pajantom, as they both struggle against all three of the aforementioned Pokemon, while other options like Melmetal and Tapu Koko also appreciate Pajantom's ability to weaken or eliminate their checks. If Pajantom isn't running Toxic itself, then teammates with the move such as Heatran, Hippowdon, and Toxapex are greatly appreciated for their ability to cripple Pajantom's checks. Equilibra is a great partner because it's walled by Pokemon like Slowking and Zapdos, which Pajantom easily takes advantage of; in return, Equilibra can remove entry hazards to keep Pajantom healthy and set Doom Desires to help it muscle past checks like Tomohawk, Buzzwole, and Clefable. Future Sight support from Slowking or Galarian Slowking is also useful to let Pajantom break past Buzzwole and Toxapex, with these teammates additionally being able to switch into many of Pajantom's checks if it's ever forced out by them. Lastly, Pajantom loves having Spikes and Stealth Rock on the field, as it's highly effective at forcing switches, and the repeated chip damage on foes like Heatran and Ferrothorn helps it remove them more reliably, so teammates that can keep up entry hazards like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Ferrothorn are great partners.</p>"

It also has a good matchup against most weather teams thanks to Trace, letting it copy Speed-boosting abilities from the likes of Barraskewda, Excadrill, and Arctozolt and potentially revenge kill these foes, in addition to copying Regenerator from foes like Slowking and Slowbro. Jumbao can run Drought with Solar Beam to support teammates like Heatran, but the opportunity cost of not copying useful abilities like Slowbro's Regenerator and Heatran's Flash Fire is usually not worth it.</p> <p>Jumbao is straight walled by Galarian Slowking, so Ground-types like Colossoil, Landorus-T, and Garchomp help to deal with it. Garchomp in particular is fantastic because Healing Wish lets it break down its checks early-game so it can sweep late-game more easily. Similarly, Flying-types like Assault Vest Tornadus, Venomicon, and Venomicon-E are problematic, so Electric-type answers such as Zapdos and Zeraora are helpful to have. Fire-types like Heatran and Astrolotl can cause issues as well, so Water-types such as Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini are strong teammates. Slowbro can also safely bring Jumbao in against Fighting-types like Urshifu-R with Teleport and provide it Future Sight support, making it harder to defensively answer.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb Jumbao is an incredibly powerful special attacker, using metagame staples like Slowbro and Zeraora as entry points to fire off its strong STAB attacks and coverage. Trace allows Jumbao to copy Slowbro’s Regenerator so it can stay healthy and constantly threaten Slowbro throughout a game. Trace also allows Jumbao to absorb Zeraora's STAB attacks and switch into most Heatran sets, both of which are useful to balance teams. Leaf Storm and Moonblast pair excellently, as the sheer power of Leaf Storm dissuades Moonblast switch-ins like Toxapex and Equilibra from coming in. Focus Blast is important coverage for Steel-types such as Corviknight, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal. Shore Up helps Jumbao stay healthy, as it is otherwise prone to entry hazard and Life Orb chip damage. A Modest nature allows Leaf Storm to guarantee a 2HKO on physically defensive Toxapex as it switches in, as well as letting Focus Blast 2HKO Corviknight after Stealth Rock. Timid may occasionally be preferred to outspeed the likes of Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Jumbao pairs well with Steel- and Water-types, which cover its weaknesses to the likes of Melmetal, Venomicon-E, and Volcarona. It pairs incredibly well with Heatran, each resisting every type the other is weak to. Additionally, Heatran can pressure Jumbao's Steel-type checks like Corviknight and Scizor and use Magma Storm to trap and remove some of Jumbao's checks such as Toxapex and Galarian-Slowking. Jumbao also pairs well with Slowbro, which has similar type synergy and can pivot Jumbao in safely with Teleport while additionally setting Future Sight, which makes Pokemon like Toxapex and Tornadus-T unable to switch into Jumbao’s attacks. Toxapex covers Jumbao’s weaknesses to Scizor, Astrolotl, and Weavile and benefits from Jumbao taking advantage of Slowbro and Zeraora. Tornadus-T greatly appreciates Jumbao's ability to stave off Zeraora and Heatran, and in return Tornadus-T can often weaken Jumbao's answers like Blissey and Galarian Slowking with Knock Off.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Much of Equilibra's strength as a team support option in the CAP metagame comes from its powerful Doom Desire and ability to compress multiple crucial roles into a single team slot, such as being a sturdy Ground immunity, Volt Switch blocker, and reliable form of hazard control. Doom Desire can force predictable and exploitable choices upon an opponent, and when used in tandem with wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom, it can often mean getting a guaranteed KO. Equilibra is also a stellar hazard remover with Rapid Spin due to its winning matchup against common Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Clefable. Flash Cannon is preferred for Equilibra's final moveslot as a means to beat Calm Mind Clefable, force out strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, and immediately pressure Flying-types like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Pain Split lets it recover against common switch-ins such as Slowking and Blissey to better check strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Tapu Lele in the long term. Aura Sphere is also an option for beating opposing Equilibra, forcing Corviknight and Skarmory to use Roost more often, and avoiding being trapped by Magnet Rise Magnezone as easily. Equilibra's EV spread is designed to outspeed Tyranitar, survive three Heat Waves from defensive Zapdos, and tank one Fire Fang from +2 Life Orb Garchomp, with the remaining EVs invested into Special Attack for stronger Doom Desires.</p> <p>Equilibra's plethora of valuable resistances and immunities combined with its ability to consistently remove entry hazards makes it very easy to find partners that appreciate its presence; Tomohawk in particular has exceptional defensive synergy as a physical wall that benefits from having Electric- and Fairy-types checked, while Equilibra enjoys Tomohawk's ability to deal with Fighting-types and strong physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom. Clefable is also relevant because it can soak up common Fighting-type coverage moves that bother Equilibra, while Equilibra in turn deals with the Poison- and Steel-types that threaten it such as Melmetal and Nidoking. Strong wallbreakers like Dragapult and Rillaboom as well as other offensive Pokemon like Zeraora appreciate Doom Desire's ability to invalidate many of their respective defensive answers. Pokemon weak to hazards such as Choice Band Weavile also enjoy Equilibra's consistency in spinning away Stealth Rock. Teams that rely on hazard stacking benefit from Equilibra's Rapid Spin not resetting their progress. Finally, it's advisable to have a reliable answer to many of the bulky Water-types that hold Equilibra back, especially Slowking; Rillaboom, Zapdos, and Jumbao are a few options that can keep the pressure up against many of these Pokemon.</p>"

  "Astrolotl": {
    "comments": "<h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro can either punish Astrolotl with Rocky Helmet or ignore its Spikes with Heavy Duty Boots and ultimately use it as bait to use Future Sight. Toxapex and Arghonaut are capable of removing Astrolotl's item and are only bothered by Stomping Tantrum after multiple Defense drops or somewhat by Will-O-Wisp in the latter's case. Tapu Fini has worse longevity overall but is still notable for preventing Astrolotl from burning it, being able to remove its Spikes with Defog and potentially crippling utility sets with Trick. Rotom-W and Swampert are also nice answers, being able to stay healthy with Pain Split and Rest, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Pajantom and Dragapult, as well as the rarer Cyclohm and Hydreigon, are all unbothered by Astrolotl's utility options. The most Astrolotl can do is hope to overwhelm them with chip damage in the long run, but it will still be forced out in any normal situation. However, Choice Scarf Astrolotl turns the tables and can revenge kill the above Dragon-types, though it can still be taken advantage of if locked into an undesirable move.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Toxic</strong>: Because Astrolotl often wants to stay in for multiple turns at once, Toxic damage can quickly add up and prevent it from accomplishing what it wants to do. Knock Off is also helpful in either mitigating the effectiveness of Regenerator on utility sets, or in the case of Choice Scarf sets, removing its ability to revenge kill a faster teammate. Though effective individually, Toxic and Knock Off combined can easily suffocate Astrolotl and prevent it from making any meaningful progress. Heatran and Magnezone are two Pokemon that can inflict Astrolotl with Toxic as it switches in, while Clefable, Toxapex, and Arghonaut can typically remove its item.</p> <p><strong>Tomohawk</strong>: While a much more niche pick, Tomohawk remains a sturdy check to any Astrolotl set. Bolstered by Intimidate, Tomohawk's physical bulk prevents Astrolotl from easily breaking through it, punishing Astrolotl's hits with Rocky Helmet in the process. Moreover, Tomohawk can remove Astrolotl's Spikes with Rapid Spin.</p>",

Regenerator not only enables Astrolotl to be a great scout against Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Magnezone, but it also lets it stay in and accrue chip damage on foes like Tapu Fini and Krilowatt before switching out scot-free, trivially healing off whatever health it lost. The combination of Fire Lash, Will-O-Wisp, and Spikes is perfect for the job; Astrolotl can repeatedly force foes out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp or after enough Defense drops from Fire Lash, further capitalizing on any forced switches with Spikes. Stomping Tantrum is required for Heatran and bulky Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, while Will-O-Wisp is useful for denying would-be checks like Landorus-T and Garchomp from freely staying or switching in. Alternatively, Encore can be used over Will-O-Wisp to disrupt setup sweepers like Tapu Fini and Venomicon. Astrolotl is a great Spikes setter for its positive matchup against common Defog users like Corviknight, simultaneously denying entry to Defog Landorus-T due to Will-O-Wisp. However, Astrolotl is just as good at using Defog itself; it can easily switch into Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Clefable and remove their hazards, while Ground-type Stealth Rock users can never switch in without being prepared to accept a burn. The given Speed investment allows Astrolotl to outspeed Kartana and Alolan Ninetales, with the remaining EVs maximizing special bulk to withstand weak special hits like Tapu Fini's Moonblast or Heatran's Earth Power.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Urshifu-R, Venomicon-E, and Weavile greatly appreciate Astrolotl's Spikes wearing down opposing bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Steel-types like Ferrothorn. Additionally, Astrolotl is a nice soft check to faster Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora that bother these Pokemon. Electric-types of your own are great partners as well, as Astrolotl can often burn the opponent's Ground-type and pave the way for a teammate like Bulk Up Zeraora or Calm Mind Tapu Koko to win. These teammates can also keep pressure up against opposing bulky Water-types for Astrolotl in return. Bulkier, slower Pokemon like Venomicon and Calm Mind Tapu Fini are massive benefactors of Astrolotl's Spikes support and its ability to often draw out longer games. Landorus-T is a particularly good partner, providing a Ground immunity, inflicting Toxic on some of Astrolotl's checks like Slowbro and Arghonaut, giving complementary support with either Stealth Rock or Defog, and being able to easily pivot Astrolotl into foes like Corviknight. Lastly, other Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory can enable Astrolotl to more comfortably run Defog or even Encore or Thunder Wave in its last moveslot.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the added Speed from Choice Scarf, Astrolotl can utilize its strong STAB combination to become a formidable fast option and offensive check to the likes of Weavile, Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Cawmodore. Flare Blitz is preferred over Fire Lash for more immediate pressure against foes like Landorus-T and the ability to always revenge kill Cawmodore from full health. Regenerator additionally mitigates recoil damage, making it a strong low-risk attacking option. Draco Meteor is crucial for OHKOing Dragapult, with additional use against Garchomp and opposing Astrolotl; alternatively, Outrage with a Jolly nature offers slightly increased damage with the tradeoff of being much easier to take advantage of. Stomping Tantrum denies Heatran from free entry and is useful as a recoil-free option against Electric-types, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking. Finally, a fast Healing Wish is a major draw of this set, letting Astrolotl give setup sweepers like Revenankh or wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Venomicon-E a second chance at finishing off a game. If Healing Wish is not needed, though, other utility moves like Defog can be run. The given EVs let Astrolotl survive one Earth Power from Heatran after Stealth Rock damage while maximizing its Speed.</p> <p>Due to Astrolotl often getting its item removed or sacrificing itself with Healing Wish, supplementary fast options like Tapu Koko and Weavile are good teammates. Astrolotl can even help weaken their defensive checks, such as opposing Landorus-T and Tapu Fini, respectively. Setup sweepers like Revenankh, Weavile, Garchomp, and Kartana that are prone to getting worn down or inflicted with status are good partners; Healing Wish allows you to play more aggressively with these sweepers early-game and attempt to clean again late-game. Strong wallbreakers that tend to get worn down by chip damage like Melmetal, Urshifu-R, and Galarian Zapdos are effective teammates for the same reason. While Regenerator helps prevent Stealth Rock damage from overwhelming Astrolotl, good entry hazard removal options like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Corviknight, and Colossoil are nonetheless helpful partners, with Astrolotl being particularly strong on teams with double hazard removal.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Miasmaw's niche in CAP lies in its access to Neutralizing Gas and its monstrous Attack stat, allowing it to deny Pokemon such as Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Slowking their Regenerator recovery while breaking open other pivots such as Tomohawk and Landorus-T. First Impression also lets it act as a good revenge killer, especially against Pokemon susceptible to chip damage such as non-Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult, Jumbao, Garchomp, and Rillaboom. Poison Jab is used to pressure opposing Fairy-types, and it can secure 2HKOs on Clefable and Tapu Fini while OHKOing Jumbao. Furthermore, Neutralizing Gas shuts down Magic Guard and Misty Surge, which would typically make Clefable and Tapu Fini immune to a potential poison. Close Combat is generally preferred to Earthquake, as it hits Corviknight neutrally while still hitting Equilibra and Ferrothorn super effectively. Earthquake can be run if hitting Toxapex and Aegislash harder is desired, though.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is usually used to outspeed Jolly Landorus-T and force it out with Dragon Hammer, though a case can be made to use Adamant to hit even harder with First Impression and Earthquake. Most notably, Adamant gives Miasmaw a chance to OHKO Slowbro and applies significantly more pressure to Tangrowth and Toxapex. Adamant Miasmaw does, however, fail to outspeed some Pokemon that would otherwise not force Miasmaw out, such as Excadrill and Nidoking.</p> <p>Due to Miasmaw's physical frailty, it appreciates being brought in by a pivot. Kerfluffle, Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Krilowatt are all good options in this regard. Kerfluffle deserves special mention, as it greatly appreciates Slowking and Galarian Slowking being denied Regenerator recovery. Steel-types such as Equilibra and Melmetal make for great teammates, as they can take on the Fairy- and Flying- types that Miasmaw struggles against. Finally, because of Miasmaw's Stealth Rock weakness, entry hazard removal from the likes of Equilibra, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos can be quite helpful in order to keep it healthy.</p>"

      "Taunt Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This set aims to take advantage of passive defensive pivots that would otherwise be solid answers to it. Taunt in conjunction with Neutralizing Gas prevents Pokemon such as Tomohawk, Slowbro, and Toxapex from recovering. Earthquake is used as coverage for Equilibra, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex. Finally, First Impression gives Miasmaw the ability to pressure faster, more frail Pokemon like Zeraora and Hydreigon while also hitting Slowbro and Slowking super effectively.</p> <p>Pokemon like Rillaboom and Kartana that appreciate recovery being denied on common physically defensive Pokemon make great teammates for Miasmaw. Miasmaw hates having its item removed, so Pokemon such as Tomohawk and Clefable that can switch into common Knock Off users work well on Miasmaw teams. Special wallbreakers and sweepers such as Kerfluffle, Volkraken, and Tapu Fini that appreciate Slowking and Galarian Slowking being denied Regenerator recovery make good teammates as well. Steel-types such as Equilibra, Melmetal, and Heatran help Miasmaw by taking on the multitude of Fairy-types in the tier. Finally, Miasmaw appreciates being brought in by a slow pivot due to its low bulk. Swampert, Slowking, and Mandibuzz all fulfill this role quite well.</p>"

    "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>A faster EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe notably lets Chromera outrun Urshifu-R and either KO it or use Color Change to avoid a 2HKO from Surging Strikes while switching into it; however, the loss in bulk leaves Chomera more easily forced out. The combination of Thunderbolt and Blizzard lets Chromera threaten to OHKO several of the tier's Ground-types, notably Garchomp and Landorus-T; however, this combination is significantly less reliable against Heatran and Ferrothorn. A defensive EV spread with Taunt, Calm Mind, Scald, and Recover excels against more defensive teams lacking Arghonaut, but its lack of offensive presence can often leave Chromera at the mercy of Color Change. Final Gambit can be run on a Choice Scarf set to get a KO against an unsuspecting opponent and/or provide general revenge killing utility.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Pajantom and Dragapult are two of Chromera's worst matchups. Dragon is super effective against itself, as is Ghost, so any STAB attack from either check makes Chromera weak to said STAB attack via Color Change. Pajantom is an especially potent check due to its high Special Defense. Dragonite can generally take any one hit Chromera can use, barring Blizzard, and force it out with Earthquake or Ice Punch. However, all of these Pokemon have to fear Blizzard or Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T, Colossoil, and Garchomp threaten to nail Chromera's sole initial weakness, have the bulk to take most of its attacks, and, in Landorus-T's case, can threaten to force it into the poor Bug typing with U-turn. However, all of them do have to fear either Blizzard or Scald.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran all take low damage from Chromera's main attacking moves, and they threaten it out using Toxic, super effective damage, or just overall power.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: As Chromera typically needs to spend several turns setting up, and foes can switch out its Poison typing via Color Change, it is vulnerable to Toxic cutting its sweeping attempt short.</p> <p><strong>Color Change Manipulation</strong>: It is relatively easy to force Chromera into a disadvantageous typing and then threaten a KO against it, for example a Slowking using Scald and then bringing Kartana in with Teleport.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Color Change is without a doubt Chromera's biggest drawback; it can make Chromera vulnerable to Toxic, often leads to Chromera being forced out, and makes Chromera a Dark-type that can't resist Ghost-type attacks for its team. Foes will often try to change Chromera's typing to their benefit using weak attacks; taking advantage of these turns by playing offensively, such as by using Calm Mind, attacking, or aggressively double switching, is key to using Chromera. Boomburst and Dark Pulse are generally Chromera's best attacks, as Boomburst boasts excellent power regardless of Chromera's typing, and Dark Pulse hits the Ghost-types that may try to take Boomburst. Do be wary, though, that Zeraora can use Plasma Fists to become immune to Boomburst. Alternatively, Scald can be run over Dark Pulse to hit Heatran and Landorus-T for super effective damage; however, this leaves Chromera walled by Dragapult and Pajantom. Throat Spray is useful to attack and boost simultaneously, especially as opponents bring in a Ground-type Chromera answer; not only do these answers threaten Chromera before Color Change activates, but they're often quite vulnerable to a +1 Boomburst or Scald. However, Leftovers can be used for significantly more defensive utility. The given EV spread ensures that Chromera can take a single super effective Earthquake from offensive Garchomp after Stealth Rock damage, as well as outrunning Heatran. Playing to keep Chromera's Dark typing is necessary to maximize its damage output. Chromera can preserve it by switching into predicted Dark-type moves or status moves from foes such as Heatran.</p> <p>Pivoting support from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W can help to get Chromera on the field, as well as preserving its initial typing, with both also providing a valuable ground immunity. As Color Change prevents Chromera from resisting Ghost more than once, Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Assault Vest Tornadus, and Assault Vest Melmetal are excellent teammates to take on Dragapult. Ferrothorn and Astrolotl both can help against opposing Ferrothorn by denying Leech Seed recovery or forcing it out, respectively, and both can set Spikes to wear down Chromera's checks, with Ferrothorn also potentially setting Stealth Rock. Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Fini both help to wear down, and they appreciate Chromera wearing down Landorus-T and Ferrothorn.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set with maximum Special Attack and HP can put in some work on Trick Room teams, but Trick Room as a whole is somewhat gimmicky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Rotom-W completely wall Venomicon and force it out with their Electric STAB moves. Venomicon can easily tank Volt Switch from both, so make sure to run Discharge or Thunderbolt. Tapu Koko can KO Venomicon after some minor chip damage, but it cannot take it out from full and is OHKOed by Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Offensive Psychic types like Necrozma and Tapu Lele can consistently force Venomicon out; however, Timid Choice Scarf Tapu Lele does not OHKO Venomicon with Psychic. Slowking and Galarian Slowking possess the special bulk and longevity necessary to switch into Venomicon repeatedly; Slowking can setup Future Sight on it and safely pivot in a wallbreaker with Teleport, while Galarian Slowking can either setup Future Sight or force Venomicon out with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Meteor Beam Sweepers</strong>: Nihilego, Stratagem, and Celesteela all force Venomicon out with Meteor Beam. Stratagem and Celesteela are not bothered by any of Venomicon's attacks, and Celesteela can further use Venomicon as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Encore Astrolotl</strong>: Though it is not a totally consistent check, Astrolotl can make Venomicon less threatening by locking it into Hurricane or Nasty Plot with Encore.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Venomicon relies on Heavy-Duty Boots to repeatedly switch onto the field, especially since it is often tasked with checking Pokemon like Landorus-T and Tapu Fini. Accordingly, Knock Off from Pokemon that can bait it in like the aforementioned Landorus-T and Tapu Fini, as well as Kartana and Clefable, hurts Venomicon's longevity and reduces its chances of sweeping with Nasty Plot.</p>",

Roost, in conjunction with Stamina, allows Venomicon to beat most physical attackers, including ones that can hit it super effectively like Zeraora and Thunder Punch Melmetal.</p> <p>Venomicon fits best on balance teams that enjoy its great defensive value and ability to reliably set up and sweep. Venomicon often forces Tapu Lele in, so Steel-types like Ferrothorn, specially defensive Heatran, and Equilibra are good partners. Because Venomicon struggles to break through Zapdos and Rotom-W, Landorus-T and Colossoil are absolutely amazing partners to bait in and cripple them with Toxic and Knock Off. Venomicon forces many switches over the course of a match; accordingly, entry hazards from Astrolotl and Garchomp help Venomicon capitalize on its threatening presence, notably wearing down Tapu Lele. Venomicon can falter against Meteor Beam offense teams, so partners like Assault Vest Melmetal and Zeraora are appreciated. Venomicon provides quite a bit of defensive potential alongside its sweeping ability; a common strategy is to pair it with other bulky setup sweepers that provide complementary defensive qualities like Tapu Fini, Dragonite, and bulky Volcarona. Tapu Fini, in particular, enjoys Venomicon's ability to check Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana, as do other Water-types like Slowbro and Arghonaut. Venomicon's special bulk enables teams to run less-consistent answers to special wallbreakers like Dragapult such as Melmetal and Corviknight.</p>"

Melmetal can switch into Venomicon-E situationally and force it out with Double Iron Bash; however, doing so multiple times can result in it getting overwhelmed. Ferrothorn can decently check Venomicon-E through the combination of Iron Barbs, Gyro Ball, and Leech Seed, but it struggles against Substitute variants.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Due to Venomicon-E's Rock weakness and tendency to take massive chip damage from Brave Bird recoil, Stealth Rock is a great way to keep its wallbreaking in check.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Venomicon-E is not running Substitute, it is quite vulnerable to status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Astrolotl and Thunder Wave from Clefable or Ferrothorn.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Venomicon-E is an incredibly potent wallbreaker thanks to its high Speed tier and Tinted Lens-boosted Brave Bird. Due to its typing and inability to lose its item, it can set up with Coil and Substitute on common defensive foes like Clefable and Landorus-T. Beyond easing setup, Substitute blocks status from Astrolotl and Clefable and Ferrothorn's Leech Seed. Alternatively, Venomicon-E can run Knock Off to weaken checks like Zapdos and Magnezone, Gunk Shot for a powerful, recoilless hit that comes with a chance to poison foes like Zapdos, or U-turn to generate momentum while doing notable chip damage due to Tinted Lens.</p> <p>Due to Venomicon-E's outstanding ability to force damage onto foes, it fits best on offensive teams. Pokemon like Dragapult, Weavile, Urshifu-R, Tapu Lele, Air Balloon Heatran, and Kartana appreciate it punching holes in the opposition. Magnezone is a notable partner, as it pressures the slow pivots that are tasked with switching into Venomicon-E repeatedly, like Corviknight and Slowbro, while trapping and KOing or chipping Ferrothorn and Melmetal; it can even situationally switch into Weavile. In return, Venomicon-E safely switches into the Ground-types that often attempt to revenge kill Magnezone. Melmetal is another outstanding partner for its ability to take on Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Due to Venomicon-E's weakness to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removal from teammates like Landorus-T, Equilibra, and Astrolotl is imperative. Similarly, entry hazard support, particularly Spikes from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, opens up Venomicon-E greatly, as it forces many switches. Venomicon-E is pressured by faster threats like Weavile and Dragapult, so Pokemon that can pressure them, like Zeraora and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, and switch into them, like Toxapex, are great partners.</p>"
