Choice Scarf allows Charmander to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and common Choice Scarf users like Mudbray, Porygon, and Magnemite. Charmander requires sun support from Vulpix. It can break down shared checks for other Fire-types and benefit from other sun sweepers like Ponyta weakening Water-types like Frillish and Mareanie, which are challenging Pokemon to chip down.

It can also use Flame Charge to turn the tables on sun teams and hit them with its boosted Flare Blitz. Ponyta must beware Hypnosis, though.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Staryu outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Vulpix, while Frillish and Mareanie have the bulk to switch in and use Recover to stall out sun turns. Staryu and Frillish must beware Energy Ball, though, and Staryu and Mareanie can be picked off by Eject Pack Overheat sets paired with Diglett.</p> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: Most variants of Diglett can trap and remove non-Choice Scarf Vulpix, although they cannot comfortably switch in.

Although less reliable, Trapinch has the bulk to take a hit from Vulpix and KO it back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Onix</strong>: Onix takes Vulpix's STAB moves well, OHKOes it with Earthquake, and can force uncomfortable turns against non-Choice Scarf Vulpix by Speed tying it. Onix is OHKOed by Energy Ball, though, and can be beaten if it loses the Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock limits Vulpix's longevity and makes it especially vulnerable to priority moves from foes like Mienfoo, Grookey, and Trapinch.</p>",

Rock Slide hits Natu and Larvesta, while Sucker Punch can KO Grookey and Choice Scarf users like Porygon and Vulpix at low health.

It can also check frail fast threats like Abra and Grookey. It also has a great matchup against hyper offense teams like sun, Spikes-stack, and dual screens due to its ability to waste turns and cripple frail sweepers. Meowth can threaten bulkier Pokemon such as Koffing and Staryu with Fake Out into Double-Edge, if these have been chipped or hit with Knock Off beforehand, allowing it to threaten bulky offense teams. However, Meowth is extremely frail and vulnerable to fainting if it cannot KO the foe, and priority users like Grookey can easily revenge kill it if they survive Feint. Pokemon with Regenerator such as Mareanie and Foongus, as well as Steel-types like Pawniard and Ferroseed, can play around Meowth to negate progress. Most importantly, however, Meowth is almost entirely outclassed as a revenge killer by Grookey, which has much stronger priority in Grassy Glide and can opt to run Fake Out if necessary.</p>",

However, Meowth already has a good matchup against 19 and 18 Speed Pokemon with Fake Out and Feint, and it misses out on the power of an Attack-boosting nature.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Since Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Magnemite resist Meowth's STAB moves and aren't weak to Water Pulse, they use it as a free turn for entry hazards, setup, or Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Priority Users</strong>: Pokemon like Pawniard and Trapinch can tank Fake Out + Feint and retaliate with their own priority, so Meowth cannot use Double-Edge. Because Meowth often gets worn down quickly, even weak priority like Mienfoo's Fake Out can threaten it late-game.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Timburr and Mienfoo can survive or prevent Fake Out + Double-Edge and OHKO or hit it with Mach Punch. Less common Fighting-types such as Croagunk can also force it out. Fighting-types must be wary of Aerial Ace, however.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Mienfoo, Porygon, and Vulpix can threaten Meowth out after it has used Fake Out.</p>",

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out helps to soften up Pokemon and revenge kill most weakened foes without Protect. If it is not enough to KO these, Feint can finish the job. Fake Out also breaks Sturdy and Focus Sash reliably, as well as helping against opposing priority users, such as weakened Timburr. Double-Edge is Meowth's strongest move; combined with Fake Out, it turns Meowth into a powerful wallbreaker, but it should be used sparingly due to the large amounts of recoil it can rack up. Water Pulse hits Onix, Dwebble, and Archen. With Fake Out, Meowth can beat SturdyJuice Onix and Dwebble as well. U-turn can be run over Water Pulse to escape bad matchups against Pokemon like Pawniard and Ferroseed. Additionally, not many Pokemon can tank Fake Out into Double-Edge, so Meowth can force many switches. It can take advantage of this to maintain momentum with U-turn. Knock Off can be run to weaken its checks, as Meowth can lure in Fighting- and Steel-types like Timburr and Ferroseed, which don't appreciate losing their Eviolite. Knock Off also prevents Regenerator cores from blocking Meowth.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Technician increases the power of Meowth's low BP moves, and Life Orb is used to boost its otherwise lacking power. 36 SpA EVs allow Meowth to KO Archen after Fake Out chip damage, and 19 HP IVs are used to limit Life Orb recoil. A Naughty nature strengthens Meowth's STAB moves and doesn't weaken Water Pulse, but U-turn variants should run an Adamant nature and an EV spread of 236 Atk / 76 Def / 196 Spe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Meowth is extremely frail, so it shouldn't switch into attacks. Instead, aim to get it into the field through slow U-turns, double switches, or revenge killing opportunities. Faster Pokemon like Abra can run Protect—try to scout their sets to use Meowth's priority effectively. Feint can break through Protect, leaving them vulnerable to another Feint. Meowth can take the most advantage of its toolkit mid- or late-game when the opposing team is sufficiently weakened, so take care to preserve it until then. Always try to scout Onix and Dwebble to ensure you don't hit Weak Armor sets with Fake Out or Sturdy sets with Water Pulse. Making the right choice can potentially mean eliminating an entry hazard lead. U-turn variants should try to predict when Steel- and Fighting-types that wall Meowth, such as Pawniard and Timburr, might come in to maintain momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters like Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Onix synergize well with Meowth chipping the opponent's team, especially if it carries U-turn. Knock Off users like Pawniard and Mienfoo allow Meowth to threaten even bulky teams, as few itemless Pokemon can take Fake Out into Double-Edge after entry hazards. Meowth appreciates having pivots such as Mienfoo and Grookey to guarantee a safe switch-in, chip foes, and maintain offensive momentum. If running Water Pulse, try pairing it with Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Rock-types like Ponyta to form wallbreaking cores. Meowth is entirely walled by Steel-types such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Magnemite, so partners like Mienfoo, Timburr, and Trapinch can take care of these.</p>"

High Horsepower hits Rock-types such as Onix and Tyrunt, as well as opposing Fire-types. Berry Juice is used to increase Ponyta's longevity, as it is worn down quickly by Stealth Rock and recoil from its attacks. Flame Body punishes priority from foes such as Mienfoo and Grookey and lets Ponyta avoid being walled by Trace Porygon. Flash Fire is a viable alternative that provides Ponyta with a useful Fire immunity that boosts the power of its STAB moves and gives Ponyta an excellent matchup against sun teams.</p> <p>This Ponyta set can be used to wallbreak mid-game or clean late-game, with the latter role mitigating its vulnerability to chip damage. Grookey makes a good partner, as it can check Water- and Ground-types for Ponyta and weaken Diglett's and Trapinch's Earthquakes; it also appreciates Ponyta's breaking through common defensive cores such as Ferroseed + Mareanie. Fast Water-types have good offensive synergy with Ponyta, which handles Grookey for them; Carvanha can lure in exploitable foes such as Ferroseed and safely bring Ponyta in with Flip Turn, while Staryu can threaten foes like Mareanie and Onix and provide Rapid Spin support. Knock Off support from teammates like Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Ferroseed softens checks like Mareanie to help Ponyta sweep late-game. Ponyta is often seen on sun teams together with Vulpix and Charmander, where Ponyta helps to break through the three Fire-types' shared counters with its power and strong coverage. A teammate capable of counter-trapping opposing Diglett, such as Trapinch, Air Balloon Diglett, or Trace Porygon, gives Ponyta much more flexibility against teams using Diglett; an ally Diglett can also trap Staryu and Mareanie. Finally, Natu is a good teammate for its ability to deny Stealth Rock.</p>"

Grookey in particular makes an excellent partner for Koffing; it handles opposing Ground-types and Frillish while providing passive recovery, while Koffing can check opposing Poison-types and wallbreak. Steel-types like Ferroseed and Pawniard are important teammates for switching into opposing Psychic-types and Porygon. Natu can switch into opposing Natu and Mudbray and serve as a secondary Grookey check. Pokemon that can check Ground- and Rock-types, such as Staryu, also make great teammates. Onix has good defensive synergy with Koffing and can sweep teams when opposing Mienfoo are weakened.</p>"

Scald is an option on the entry hazard set to potentially burn switch-ins such as Staryu and Ferroseed, although it is inconsistent and significantly weaker than Hydro Pump.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash makes Omanyte threatening, doubling both its Special Attack and Speed. Hydro Pump KOes most non-Water-resistant targets and has a high chance to KO foes like Mienfoo after Shell Smash. Surf is an alternative that's more accurate but requires notably more prior damage to get KOs. Ice Beam hits Grass-types like Foongus and Grookey, and it's the best move to hit Ferroseed, as well as being a safer option to hit Natu and Ground-types. Earth Power allows Omanyte to OHKO Mareanie and hit Staryu.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is preferred for damage output, as Omanyte does not need a Timid nature to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Mienfoo after Shell Smash. Eviolite and Shell Armor give it more opportunities to set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Omanyte should be used as a late-game sweeper that sets up after its checks and counters are damaged or removed. In particular, Ferroseed, Grookey, and Timburr should be removed, as they can survive a hit and revenge kill Omanyte after Shell Smash. Omanyte's typing doesn't allow it to set up in front of many common Pokemon, but the best ones are Choice-locked Vulpix and Choice-locked Porygon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Trapinch is the best partner on balance teams because it traps and removes Omanyte's strongest counters in Grookey and Ferroseed, as well ass being able to deal with Pawniard. Ponyta is another option to remove these counters. Fighting-resistant foes like Koffing and Foongus, or the more niche Spritzee, help against Mienfoo and especially Timburr with its threatening Mach Punch. Ferroseed is a good counter to Focus Sash Abra and SturdyJuice Magnemite and can cripple them with Knock Off, which is a good move to have on various team members to weaken Staryu and opposing Ferroseed. Omanyte can also fit on dual screens hyper offense teams, usually using Natu as a dual screens setter; common partners on this team structure are Swords Dance Grookey and Pawniard.</p>"

      "Entry Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Omanyte's best offensive move, being able to threaten any neutral target after a Speed boost. Knock Off weakens switch-ins that might come in to stop the Shell Smash set, especially bulky ones like Mareanie, Staryu, and Ferroseed. Spikes in combination with Stealth Rock can be very effective at forcing passive damage on the opposing team, especially if Omanyte's partners can prevent or punish entry hazard removal. Blizzard hits Grass-types like Grookey and Foongus on the switch, while Ice Beam is a safer but considerably weaker option. Toxic Spikes helps against hyper offense teams, which rarely use Poison-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Defense investment with Eviolite allows Omanyte to more easily switch in multiple times, avoiding the OHKO from strong super effective attacks like Earthquake from Life Orb Diglett and High Jump Kick from Eviolite Mienfoo. 13 Speed is enough to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a Weak Armor boost, as well as most common Choice Scarf users. The Speed boost provided by Weak Armor allows it to generate offensive pressure or set multiple layers of entry hazards. Another possible EV spread alongside Grookey is 156 HP / 196 SpA / 156 Spe with a Timid nature; it allows Omanyte to survive all the needed hits, like Earthquake from Diglett and Mudbray, under Grassy Terrain while also getting an extra point in Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Omanyte is a common pick on entry hazard-stacking hyper offense teams as a dedicated lead, setting at least Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes against most opposing leads. It is best utilized early- and mid-game by safely switching into common Pokemon like Choice-locked Vulpix and Porygon to set entry hazards. Omanyte should always get on the field through a pivot move or by switching into a resisted hit, preferably physical attacks to get the Weak Armor boost. If the matchup is not favorable and the opponent can KO Omanyte before it can do anything, the main goal is to try and set one or two layers of Spikes before it's removed from the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>On hyper offense teams, good sweepers and wallbreakers like Grookey, Choice Scarf Mudbray, and Life Orb Abra appreciate Omanyte's ability to set entry hazards and weaken their targets. On balance teams, it needs teammates that can switch into Grookey, so Foongus, Koffing, and Ponyta are good picks. Omanyte also benefits from pivot moves that allow it to come on the field safely, like U-turn from Mienfoo and Volt Switch from Magnemite. Pawniard punishes Defog attempts, while Magnemite, Tyrunt, and Grookey pressure common entry hazard control measures like Natu and Staryu; also, Diglett can trap the latter.</p>"

Crunch hits a majority of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Psychic Fangs is important coverage against Mienfoo and Poison-types like Foongus and Koffing, allowing Carvanha to OHKO them after Knock Off or prior chip damage.

Koffing is a fantastic partner, as it switches very well into Mienfoo's and Grookey's attacks, and its Neutralizing Gas negates Mienfoo's Regenerator, helping Carvanha wear it down.

Trapinch traps and revenge kills non-Protect Grookey with First Impression, and it can take out Pawniard or a weakened Ferroseed with Superpower. Natu checks Ferroseed, Foongus, and Mareanie, forcing them out and pivoting Carvanha in safely. Knock Off support from Mienfoo, Ferroseed, and Pawniard can remove Eviolite from Mienfoo and Poison-types to let Carvanha OHKO those threats.

It can sometimes even go for the win with Calm Mind or Cosmic Power, which Trapinch can do little to stop. The niche Crunch and Rock Slide are options to hit it.</p> <p><strong>Foongus</strong>: Foongus is difficult to trap and can punish Trapinch by putting one of its teammates to sleep with Spore.

Staryu can sometimes be picked off at low health with First Impression, though this is rare because Staryu can recover.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: As Trapinch is slow, it relies on its bulk to trap key foes, and not staying healthy can prevent it from performing its role. Trapinch must be selectively deployed, as trapping Pawniard or Diglett will prevent it from later trapping Ponyta or Tyrunt and vice versa.

Alternatively, Psychic can be run to hit Poison-types, such as Koffing and Foongus, on the switch. 12 Speed EVs allow Spritzee to outspeed Foongus. Ferroseed partners well with Spritzee, as Spritzee checks Fighting-types and Natu for Ferroseed and offers Wish. In exchange, Ferroseed deals with certain Poison-type checks such as Foongus and can set entry hazards, punishing Pokemon that try to switch into Spritzee and force it out, such as Koffing and Ponyta. Psychic-types, such as Natu, and Pokemon with strong Psychic-type coverage, such as Porygon, are also good choices for dealing with Poison-types.

Steel-types, such as Pawniard outside of Trick Room and Ferroseed, present issues for this set, so Spritzee benefits from teammates that can deal with them, such as Ponyta and Mienfoo. Mienfoo can also serve as a pivot to bring Spritzee into play through U-turn. Fire-types such as Ponyta also beat this set, so trappers such as Diglett and Trapinch make for good teammates.

Close Combat KOes Pawniard and Porygon after a boost, and it hits Ferroseed and Onix hard.

Memento Diglett also helps Tyrunt set up safely. Pawniard can lure in a Trapinch, sacrificing itself to weaken Trapinch with Knock Off, preventing it from beating Tyrunt later in the game. Grassy Terrain from Grookey weakens Earthquake from Diglett and Trapinch. Pokemon that deal with Timburr, like Koffing and Mareanie, are necessary to switch into Mach Punch for Tyrunt.

Iron Defense can turn Mareanie into a wincon and makes it harder for Diglett to trap it. Toxic Spikes can cripple much of the metagame, but it is rarely useful because most teams have a Poison-type to absorb it. When using Toxic Spikes, it is optimal to set only one layer, as LC's low HP values and frequent switches cause regular poison to do more damage than Toxic poison.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Diglett</strong>: Mareanie's Ground weakness makes it very vulnerable to being trapped by Diglett. Mareanie is bulky enough to survive an Earthquake or Earth Power from non-Life Orb sets though, so Diglett requires prior damage or Knock Off support to ensure the OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Psychic-types force Mareanie out with their super effective attacks. Abra can OHKO Mareanie outright, Natu grabs momentum with U-turn, and Galarian Ponyta can set up on it. Psychic-type coverage from foes such as Staryu and Porygon can also threaten Mareanie. However, none of these foes appreciate switching into Knock Off or Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Mudbray</strong>: Mudbray outspeeds Mareanie and OHKOes it with its Ground attacks. However, Mudbray must be careful not to take a Scald, which hits it hard and can cripple it with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Koffing</strong>: Koffing denies Mareanie Regenerator recovery and hits it hard with Thunderbolt. However, it does not appreciate switching into Scald or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Ferroseed resists Mareanie's STAB combination and can make progress through Knock Off, Thunder Wave, or Stealth Rock. Foongus heals off any damage and threatens it with Spore. Mareanie can make progress against these foes with Knock Off or Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Magnemite OHKOes Mareanie, while coverage from foes such as Porygon, Staryu, and Ponyta severely dents it.
