  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro is the most versatile physical wall in the tier, checking most of the tier with its great defensive typing, access to Regenerator, and deep movepool. Its typing alone lets it check some of NU's best physical wallbreakers and sweepers like Lycanroc-D, Mienshao, and Cloyster, using them as an opportunity to set up with Calm Mind or Future Sight. Slowbro is also a fantastic user of Tera, luring in Dark-types like Alolan Muk and Brute Bonnet before it uses Tera Poison or Fairy, which make them useless against it. Slowbro has a lot of move versatility, too: Future Sight enables Fighting-type teammates to break each other's checks; Psychic Noise cripples opposing walls and bulky setup sweepers; Thunder Wave punishes switch-ins; and Calm Mind pairs well with Slowbro's high physical bulk, making it hard to KO both physically and specially and boosting its own damage output in the process. Regenerator keeps Slowbro alive longer, letting it switch in to any physical move whenever it wants without worrying too much about residual damage. Slowbro also has a wide range of items it can use; Covert Cloak to ignore Scald's burn and Psychic Noise's heal blocking, Rocky Helmet to further punish physical wallbreakers and pivots, and Leftovers to keep it healthy. Pressuring Slowbro isn't easy, but some strong special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Thundurus, and Choice Specs Noivern are able to force it out, even after a boost or two. Entry hazards are also a thorn in Slowbro's side, detracting from the HP restored by Regenerator. Slowbro also doesn't enjoy status, as it is a common target of Toxic, which sometimes forces it to Terastallize, while being burned forces it to use Slack Off more often.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowbro can take on a more standard defensive set, swapping out Calm Mind for Thunder Wave to punish anything that tries to stay in against it. Defensive Slowbro can also use Foul Play to punish setup sweepers like Flygon, Feraligatr, and Gallade, which it otherwise struggles to KO. Future Sight enables wallbreakers like Mienshao, Lycanroc-D, and Gallade to get an early- or mid-game KO on Dark- and Steel-types trying to absorb Future Sight or the Poison- and Ground-types switching into those wallbreakers, often creating a lot of progress. Flamethrower can be used instead of a Psychic-type attack to hit Steel- and Grass-types like Registeel, Klefki, and Tsareena, but it lacks power when unboosted, and Slowbro generally doesn't like facing Grass-types. Nasty Plot pairs well with Future Sight, boosting Slowbro's Special Attack more than Calm Mind does, but it isn't reliable because Slowbro enjoys the boost to its Special Defense that Calm Mind gives. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Slowbro doesn't take any entry hazard damage while switching in and gives it an immunity to Toxic Spikes, letting it switch in more often and support its team with Scald. Colbur Berry lets Slowbro take any Dark-type attack, such as Lycanroc-D's Crunch, Incineroar's Knock Off, and Krookodile's Knock Off, giving it the opportunity to retaliate with Scald. Assault Vest lets Slowbro tank more hits from special wallbreakers like Noivern, Mew, and Venusaur, but it makes Slowbro lose out on Slack Off's recovery and rely too heavily on Regenerator. Eject Button turns Slowbro into a one-time pivot, safely letting frail teammates like Lycanroc-D, Mienshao, and Thundurus in for free. Lastly, Slowbro can opt for Tera Water to retain part of its original typing while getting rid of its weakness to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks and boosting Scald's damage, but it isn't often used due to the defensive merits of Tera Poison and Fairy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Brute Bonnet, and Calm Mind Sylveon are able to keep up with Slowbro's pace to beat it in a matchup, often forcing it to Terastallize. Alolan Muk, especially, matches up well into Slowbro, removing its item with Knock Off and threatening it with poison if it has not used Tera Poison.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong special wallbreakers such as Chandelure and Choice Specs variants of Noivern and Sylveon can all force Slowbro out due to their unboosted power, but if it has already set up with Calm Mind, then they aren't guaranteed to KO. Other sweepers like Nasty Plot Lucario and Scope Lens Kingdra can bait in Slowbro, but they can be exploited by Slowbro's teammates as well.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Alolan Muk, Krookodile, and Incineroar all pressure Slowbro with their powerful Dark-type attacks. However, they risk getting hit by Scald, and the former two don't want to get burned. Users of Tera Dark like Feraligatr and Lycanroc-D are able to KO Slowbro after a boost with super effective coverage, while Tera Dark Vaporeon is able to wall it thanks to Water Absorb and its new Psychic-type immunity.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Thundurus, Oricorio-E, and Raikou can all set up against Slowbro due to their threatening Electric-type attacks; Oricorio-E is also able to use Taunt to stop Slowbro's setup attempts, but it fears Psychic Noise stopping it from using Roost. Choice Specs users like Magnezone and Toxtricity also threaten an OHKO, but they can lose if Slowbro has set up and Terastallized.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Calm Mind pairs well with Slowbro's great physical bulk, making it hard to KO after a boost. Psychic Noise is the STAB move of choice thanks to its matchup against bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus, Mew, and especially opposing Slowbro without Covert Cloak, letting it win the matchup every time. Psychic Noise also helps against Unaware Quagsire, which can stall out Slowbro. Psyshock is a stronger option that lets Slowbro sweep easier, making it more of a threat early- and mid-game; Psyshock is also able to beat Tera Poison Slowbro reliably, even if the opposing Slowbro has Psychic Noise. Covert Cloak is Slowbro's go-to item because it gives it a winning matchup against opposing Slowbro, ignoring Scald's burn and Psychic Noise's heal blocking. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers and pivots such as Mienshao, Lycanroc-D, and Talonflame, forcing damage on them as Slowbro switches in. Leftovers lessens the need to use Slack Off. Tera Poison retains Slowbro's Fighting-type resistance, removes its weakness to Knock Off, and gives it an immunity to Toxic while simultaneously helping it in the matchup against Alolan Muk, letting Slowbro use it as setup fodder; however, Tera Poison comes with the downside of losing the matchup to other Psychic-types such as Mew, Reuniclus, and most notably other Slowbro. Tera Fairy also retains Slowbro's Fighting-type resistance and allows it to resist Dark-type attacks, but it opens up space to be KOed by Alolan Muk, Gunk Shot Krookodile, and Meteor Mash Lucario.</p> <p>Thanks to its great defensive typing paired with its physical bulk, Slowbro pairs well with Alolan Muk. Slowbro switches into strong physical wallbreakers that target Alolan Muk such as Krookodile, Mienshao, and Flygon while Alolan Muk can switch into special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Thundurus, and Calm Mind Reuniclus. Slowbro also enjoys having Mienshao as a partner to form a Regenerator core, as Slowbro helps deal with revenge killers like Choice Scarf Infernape and Talonflame as well as Poison-types like Vileplume that punish Mienshao. In return, Mienshao can KO Dark-type Pokemon like Incineroar, Brute Bonnet, and Krookodile that try to KO Slowbro. Variants of Slowbro not running Heavy-Duty Boots appreciate entry hazard removal from the likes of Tsareena, Brambleghast, and Talonflame or a grounded Poison-type like Alolan Muk or Vileplume. Ground-types that can switch into Electric-type attacks like Krookodile, Flygon, and Rhyperior aid Slowbro, giving it the opportunity to set up later in battle. Other physical wallbreakers like Lycanroc-D, Gallade, and Incineroar help beat bulky setup sweepers like Mew, Reuniclus, and opposing Slowbro, which Slowbro has a hard time fighting. Slowbro is able to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Talonflame, Klefki, and Registeel, making it easier for Pokemon like Mienshao, Choice Specs Dragalge, and Porygon-Z to sweep.</p>"

Poison Touch and Poison Jab let Muk effortlessly spread poison, even on Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes such as Drifblim and Eelektross. Drain Punch hits Steel-types such as Copperajah and Terastallized Appletun that would otherwise wall Muk. Haze stops setup sweepers such as Vivillon and Calm Mind Vaporeon from setting up. Toxic Spikes lets Muk take advantage of free turns and cripple the opposing team with poison. Tera Dark allows Muk to beat threats like Bruxish and Zoroark after baiting them into their powerful Dark- and Psychic-type attacks and retaliate back while also being able to use Haze against boosted Stored Power users like Veluza and Farigiraf. Alternatively, Tera Water provides an overall better defensive typing, more specifically easing the matchup against offensive Water-types like Calm Mind Vaporeon and Choice Specs Clawitzer. Muk struggles with Pokemon such as Sandaconda, which does not fear its poison due to Shed Skin and can threaten it back with Earthquake. As a result, Muk appreciates teammates such as Rotom, Eelektross, and Cacturne, which can switch into Sandaconda and force it out.

Shadow Sneak provides Muk with a form of priority, allowing it to revenge kill Ghost-types like Haunter and Rotom or faster threats like Bruxish and Veluza. Poison Touch in combination with Poison Jab gives Muk a 51% chance to poison foes, wearing them down in the process. Sticky Hold prevents Muk from being crippled by Trick from Rotom or Knock Off from Passimian. Tera Water serves as a strong defensive typing, while Tera Dark can be used to help Muk combat Pokemon like Bruxish and Farigiraf. Lurantis pairs well with this particular Muk set, removing Pokemon like Sandaconda, Haze Vaporeon, and Taunt Qwilfish. Zoroark and Passimian can scare away Psychic-types like Bruxish, Indeedee-F, and Medicham that hinder Muk's ability to set up and sweep.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Alolan Muk's useful defensive typing and high Special Defense allow it to be one of the top threats in the metagame. Common special attackers like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Reuniclus are stopped in their tracks and forced out by it. On top of this, Alolan Muk isn't useless against bulkier Pokemon either; thanks to its access to Knock Off in combination with Poison Touch, it can slowly beat Sylveon, Talonflame, and Gastrodon. Poison Touch along with Poison Jab allow it to spread poison nearly uninhibited, letting it chip away at opposing teams quite easily. However, Alolan Muk is quite frail physically, often being forced out by pivots like Mienshao and Flygon and losing momentum. It is also weak to fairly common Ground-types like Flygon, Krookodile, and Rhyperior, which then get free turns to set entry hazards or boost their offensive stats. Also, its reliance on unreliable and passive forms of recovery can let it be overwhelmed and taken advantage of.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more offensive Alolan Muk with an Assault Vest and a moveset of Knock Off / Poison Jab / Drain Punch / and one of Ice Punch, Rock Slide, Giga Drain, or Shadow Sneak can be used to take special hits while also pressuring foes, but, in doing so, it sacrifices a lot of longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon like Krookodile, Flygon, and Rhyperior easily OHKO Alolan Muk with a super effective Earthquake, and they can capitalize on a forced switch by setting Stealth Rock or boosting.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Mienshao, Gallade, and Lucario, while not having a way to hit Alolan Muk super effectively, overwhelm it, taking advantage of its low Defense with their powerful Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Vileplume and Tera Poison Slowbro can wall Alolan Muk due to their immunity to poison. On top of that, Vileplume is able to set up Leech Seed or use Growth, while Slowbro freely sets up with Calm Mind and threatens it with a burn.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Physical wallbreakers like Lycanroc-D and Feraligatr easily overwhelm Alolan Muk with their Choice Band- and Life Orb-boosted attacks due to its low Defense.</p> <p><strong>Setup Pokemon</strong>: With how passive Alolan Muk can be, especially with Rest, it can be setup fodder for Pokemon like Cloyster, Gallade, and Flygon.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Poison Jab is preferred for damage, but Poison Fang can be used to spread poison more easily. Rest + Sleep Talk offers recovery but is sometimes unreliable; alternatively, Drain Punch + Protect allows Alolan Muk to regain health while threatening Steel-types like Magnezone and Lucario. Tera Water can be used to better take Fire-type attacks from Hisuian Typhlosion and Chandelure, and it gifts Alolan Muk a strong defensive Tera type that can take on tons of Pokemon well. However, Tera Dragon improves the sun matchup, retains a good rain matchup, and helps Alolan Muk check other special attackers like Thundurus and Rotom-H better than Tera Water does. Both Tera Water and Dragon help Alolan Muk when facing Ground-types, but they tend to leave it more susceptible to other physical wallbreakers like Tsareena and Brambleghast.</p> <p>Alolan Muk fails against physical attackers, especially Ground- and Fighting-types such as Krookodile, Flygon, Lucario, and Mienshao. So, Pokemon like Slowbro, Swampert, and Talonflame help to form a strong defensive core for the team. After using Knock Off, Alolan Muk is almost helpless against Steel-types like Registeel and Klefki as they set entry hazards or boost; its Drain Punch is just too weak. To counter this, teammates that can handle these foes such as Infernape, Krookodile, and Flygon pair well with Alolan Muk. Since it can deal with Psychic- and Ghost-types easily, Pokemon such as Mienshao, Mew, and Munkidori greatly appreciate Alolan Muk's presence. Because of how easily Alolan Muk can remove items, hazard setters like Klefki, Rhyperior, and Quagsire have great synergy with it. On the flip side, with how many times Alolan Muk is forced to switch into an attack, hazards become an issue for it, jeopardizing its ability to take on Chandelure and Munkidori. To clear these hazards, Pokemon like Talonflame, Noivern, and Tsareena pair perfectly.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster is one of the most powerful late-game sweepers in the tier. Its high Defense stat allows it to take a hit before boosting with Shell Smash, and once boosted, it is incredibly difficult to wall or outspeed. Physical attackers, particularly Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Basculegion, provide ample opportunity for Cloyster to set up. Skill Link only increases Cloyster's offensive capability, making Icicle Spear and Rock Blast more consistent and dangerous. Cloyster also has a wide variety of natural coverage options with Icicle Spear, Rock Blast, and Drill Run and often carries Tera Blast to effectively choose its counters. Heavy-Duty Boots, Focus Sash, and entry hazard control can all help give it clear opportunities to boost. However, its low Special Defense, relatively low Speed, and weakness to Stealth Rock can make setting up difficult. Revenge killing Cloyster can be difficult after a Shell Smash boost, as +2 Jolly Cloyster outspeeds all common Choice Scarf users, but priority moves, such as Vacuum Wave or Sucker Punch, can take it out. Checks to Cloyster depend largely on the coverage and Tera type it uses. Bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro, Vaporeon, and Unaware Quagsire, tend to do well but can be blown up by Tera Blast Electric and Grass. Steel-types like Registeel or Magnezone can resist many of Cloyster's attacks but struggle with Drill Run and Tera Ground.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cloyster can choose to run Liquidation as an alternate STAB move option, and it can also choose to run Ice Shard, primarily on Adamant sets, to hit the few Pokemon that outspeed and threaten it. Hydro Pump is niche but lets Cloyster always beat Avalugg after a Shell Smash boost. Tera Ghost is another option, particularly on slower Adamant sets, to gain an immunity against Fighting-type moves like Close Combat from revenge killers like Choice Scarf Mienshao. Tera Steel is potentially useful to resist Accelerock and give Cloyster additional resistances as it sets up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types can be extremely difficult for Cloyster to break without the use of Tera Blast Grass or Electric. Slowbro and Vaporeon both comfortably take hits from Cloyster, while Unaware Quagsire counters its gameplan entirely. Vileplume also baits Icicle Spear and can use Tera Water to resist it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Without Drill Run or Tera Blast Ground, Cloyster struggles to break through Steel-types. Registeel and Magnezone, particularly if they have the opportunity to use Iron Defense, are serious checks to a potential sweep. Klefki also threatens to cripple Cloyster with priority Thunder Wave. Thundurus and Tsareena both have the potential to bait Icicle Spear, use Tera Steel to survive a hit, and KO Cloyster in return.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: +2 Jolly Cloyster outspeeds every Choice Scarf user in the tier, so priority moves are the main source of revenge killing against it. Lycanroc-D's Accelerock, Brute Bonnet's Sucker Punch, and Mew and Lucario's Vacuum Wave can threaten to end a Cloyster sweep. Boosted Adamant Cloyster can be outsped by several Choice Scarf users, notably Munkidori, Mienshao, and Flygon. Chlorophyll Venusaur can also revenge kill a boosted Cloyster, but it requires a Timid nature to outspeed Jolly Cloyster.</p>",

Tera Blast gives Cloyster the coverage to break through the Water-types that would otherwise counter it entirely. At +2, Tera Blast Grass and Electric can OHKO Vaporeon and 2HKO Slowbro. Tera Blast Grass also notably has a chance to OHKO Unaware Quagsire. Drill Run provides super effective damage against the Steel-types that would otherwise wall Cloyster, and at +2, it OHKOes Magnezone and 2HKOes Registeel. Tera Electric and Ground also provide an immunity to the threat of Prankster Thunder Wave. Focus Sash guarantees an opportunity to use Shell Smash but requires support to keep entry hazards off the field. White Herb restores Cloyster's defenses after a Shell Smash, bolstering it against revenge kills. Heavy-Duty Boots protects Cloyster from its Stealth Rock weakness and preserves health to let it take a hit before boosting. Cloyster requires a Jolly nature to outspeed common Choice Scarf users, notably outspeeding Mienshao and Munkidori. An Adamant nature can hit a few additional breakpoints, giving Cloyster a chance to OHKO Registeel with +2 Tera Ground-boosted Drill Run and guaranteeing it an OHKO on specially bulky Diancie with +2 Tera Blast Grass.</p> <p>Cloyster works best on hyper offense teams that provide opportunities to sweep and wear down its checks. It benefits heavily from teammates that can chip or seriously damage the Water- and Steel-types that can wall it.

Ground- and Fighting-types like Krookodile, Mienshao, and Gallade can put a serious dent in Steel-types, and Gallade and Krookodile in particular threaten Slowbro with Leaf Blade and Knock Off, respectively. Hazard setters like Klefki, Flygon, and Mew can also support Cloyster's sweeping, wearing down foes that it cannot OHKO. Galvantula serves a similar role, setting up Sticky Web to allow Cloyster to run an Adamant nature and outrun Choice Scarf Infernape, Mienshao, and Munkidori after a boost. Other late-game cleaners like Mienshao or a Shell Smash Torterra benefit from Cloyster's damage output and can storm through teams whose physical walls have already taken multiple hits.</p>"

To help solve this issue, Pokemon such as your own Sandaconda, Hattrem, and Drifblim can pivot into their attacks and threaten them with paralysis or burn. Hisuian Qwilfish is hindered by losing its Eviolite via Knock Off or Trick; pair it with Pokemon that can afford to lose their item such as Sandaconda, Sableye, and Sticky Hold Muk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hisuian Qwilfish is a potent rain sweeper. It has neutral coverage for every foe in NU bar Toxicroak and outspeeds every relevant revenge killer under rain. Even outside of rain, it's still a good option for late-game sweeping because its coverage and Eviolite-boosted bulk give it good leverage against most countermeasures the opponent could have. The major selling point to this set is Liquidation, as it always OHKOes Sandaconda after Hisuian Qwilfish uses Swords Dance and Terastallizes.</p> <p>If you're using Hisuian Qwilfish on a rain team, pairing it with rain setters like Sableye, Electrode, and Whiscash is a must. Additionally, you'll want Floatzel, which is great at weakening potential checks like Tera Water Sandaconda, Qwilfish, and Avalugg. Golduck is also a staple of NU rain teams and benefits from Hisuian Qwilfish weakening Toxicroak. If you're not using a rain team, simply pair Hisuian Qwilfish with wallbreakers like Medicham, Hisuian Sneasel, and Bruxish.

    "overview": "<p>Flygon's great set versatility makes it an elite Pokemon and one of the best Ground-types in NU. Choice Scarf Flygon fits on many teams, outspeeding and limiting many wallbreakers such as non-Choice Scarf Mienshao and Lycanroc-D. Choice Band gives Flygon an incredibly spammable Earthquake and makes it a lot harder to switch into. Flygon can also pivot out with U-turn, allowing it to maintain offensive pressure and momentum. Dragon Dance Flygon can use Loaded Dice, which makes it a great late-game sweeper, and it also threatens lead entry hazard setters like Lycanroc-D, Galvantula, and Smeargle; it also resists Lycanroc-D's Accelerock, so it's hard to revenge kill. However, as a Choice Scarf user, it faces competition from Mienshao and Infernape, both of which are faster than it and can revenge kill it with Close Combat. Additionally, Flygon's average Attack stat leaves it struggling when facing physical walls like Slowbro, Vileplume, and Avalugg, as they can still take its attacks even after a Dragon Dance boost. Choice Scarf Flygon can be very easy to play around due to both of its STAB options having common immunities and resistances.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flygon can run a mixed set with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast, allowing it to hit physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg, Slowbro, and Vileplume. It can also run a Choice Specs set with Tera Normal, which gives it a powerful Boomburst. However, both of these sets are not common due to Flygon's low Special Attack. Flygon can also run a utility set with Stealth Rock / Earthquake / Dragon Tail / U-turn with a bulkier EV spread. This set allows it to set entry hazards for its teammates and check foes like Copperajah, Lycanroc-D, and Infernape. Sadly, Flygon lacks any recovery, making it very easy for it to get worn down by chip damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Sylveon and Florges are able to tank hits from Choice Scarf Flygon and KO it back with their STAB Fairy-type attacks; however, neither of them can handle Choice Band sets, and they are complete setup fodder against Tera Steel Dragon Dance Flygon.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Avalugg, Slowbro, and Vileplume have enough bulk to win against any of Flygon's sets, but Vileplume has to be careful directly switching into +1 Flygon if entry hazards are present. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Quagsire are bulky enough to tank a boosted attack and threaten Flygon back with status and Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users and Faster Attackers</strong>: Infernape, Lucario, Brute Bonnet, and Feraligatr can revenge kill Flygon after it has been weakened a bit. Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Infernape can outspeed even Choice Scarf Flygon and destroy it with Close Combat.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Outrage is one of Flygon's strongest STAB attacks for late-game cleaning, and it can 2HKO foes like Tsareena and Mew on a switch. Dragon Claw is a safer option to avoid getting locked into Outrage, but it's significantly weaker and is harder to revenge kill foes with. U-turn allows Flygon to maintain momentum and provide free switches to teammates. Flygon's last move is commonly Stone Edge, which allows it to hit Flying-types like Talonflame, Noivern, and Thundurus. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows it to set entry hazards for its teammates. Flygon can run Dragon Claw alongside Outrage so that it can still revenge kill foes like Thundurus and Tsareena without getting immediately destroyed by Fairy-types. First Impression can be used over Stone Edge, allowing Flygon to revenge kill weakened boosted and faster threats like Cloyster and Choice Scarf Munkidori. Tera Steel gives Flygon a resistance to Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon like Sylveon, Florges, and Noivern. This also allows it to check some special wallbreakers like Mew, Dragalge, and Porygon-Z.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Magnezone, Mienshao, and Lycanroc-D appreciate Choice Scarf Flygon for giving them free entry with U-turn. Flygon can form a VoltTurn core with special attackers like Magnezone, Thundurus, and Toxtricity. They can threaten physical walls like Slowbro, Avalugg, and Vileplume; in return, Flygon can pressure special walls like Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Gallade. Choice Scarf Flygon struggles to break past bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Swampert, and Quagsire, which tank its attacks and punish it with Scald, Toxic, Knock Off, and slow Flip Turn. Grass-types like Brambleghast, Brute Bonnet, and Vileplume similarly appreciate Flygon's U-turn giving them free entry to handle the aforementioned bulky Water-types. Steel-types like Copperajah, Registeel, and Magnezone appreciate Flygon for checking Fire-types like Chandelure, Infernape, and Incineroar; in return, they can check Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Tera Fairy Slowbro. Choice Scarf Flygon appreciates entry hazard support from Copperajah, Diancie, and Swampert, as it can wear down foes to help with Choice Scarf Flygon's low damage output.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band gives Flygon more immediate power, allowing it to always 2HKO Vileplume and Quagsire after Spikes damage with Earthquake. Outrage is still an option to allow Flygon to 2HKO Calm Mind Reuniclus and Quagsire, but Dragon Claw is preferred so Flygon isn't easily revenge killed by Fairy-types. First Impression revenge kills weakened foes like Porygon-Z, Feraligatr, and Torterra. Tera Bug gives First Impression a power boost, allowing Flygon to KO Mew and do major damage to defensive Reuniclus. Tera Steel can sometimes be preferred over Tera Bug, since it's better defensively and allows Flygon to pivot without getting chipped heavily by Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Choice Band Flygon likes having entry hazard support from teammates like Klefki, Copperajah, and Diancie to wear down foes that can repeatedly switch into it. Many Pokemon that tend to struggle against bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Milotic, such as Registeel, Infernape, and Basculegion, appreciate Choice Band Flygon's ability to 2HKO them on the switch. However, while it can 2HKO most bulky Water-types, it can't always beat them one-on-one, so it pairs well with Grass-types like Tsareena, Brambleghast, and Vileplume. Physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg, Reuniclus, and Slowbro can take Flygon's attacks with ease, so it pairs best with Pokemon like Magnezone, Alolan Muk, and Slowbro that can handle these physical walls. Future Sight Slowbro and Reuniclus can be great partners for Choice Band Flygon, allowing it to weaken physical walls like Milotic, Avalugg, and Vileplume.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Dragon Dance with a Scale Shot boost allows Flygon to outspeed the entire tier, including common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Infernape. An Adamant nature is preferred over a Jolly nature for the extra power boost, but the latter is still useful to avoid always being outsped by opposing Choice Scarf Flygon at +1. Outrage can be used over Scale Shot to allow Flygon to be a late-game cleaner. Alternatively, Dragon Claw can be used to avoid getting locked into Outrage, which would otherwise make it easily revenge killed by Fairy-types. Fire Punch allows Flygon to hit Grass-types like Tsareena, Vileplume, and Brute Bonnet as well as opposing Tera Steel Flygon. Thunder Punch is able to hit Water- and Flying-types like Vaporeon, Talonflame, and Milotic; lastly, U-turn allows Flygon to pivot out from a bad matchup, and it's also pretty common to see on non-Scale Shot Dragon Dance Flygon sets. Tera Steel allows it to be immune to Umbreon and Quagsire's Toxic. Tera Fire gives Fire Punch a much-needed power boost and retains the resistance to Fairy-type attacks that Tera Steel gives. Leftovers can be used over Loaded Dice, giving Flygon needed recovery. Alternately, Soft Sand gives it a boost to Earthquake, which allows it to 2HKO Vileplume and Vaporeon after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Flygon appreciates entry hazard support from Klefki and Rhyperior to guarantee a 2HKO on Pokemon like Vileplume and Rhyperior. Toxic Spikes in particular is helpful, since it makes it a lot easier to break through physical walls like Slowbro, Swampert, and Rhyperior that would usually tank many hits from a Dragon Dance boost. Flygon is a perfect pick for hyper offense teams due to its Sticky Web immunity and because it can sweep opposing hyper offense teams. It can also punish lead hazard setters like Galvantula, Smeargle, and Lycanroc-D by setting up a Dragon Dance and breaking their Focus Sashes with Scale Shot. Other sweepers like Lucario, Cloyster, and Lycanroc-D appreciate Dragon Dance Flygon's ability to weaken teams so they can win late-game. Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Infernape can force Flygon to switch out even if it's at +1 because they can still outspeed it. Thus, slow pivots like Magnezone, Swampert, and Eject Button Slowbro can help by bringing Flygon in safely.</p>"

Braviary is an excellent teammate for Cacturne, since it dissuades Defog attempts with Defiant and reliably pressures special walls. In return, Cacturne offers Braviary safety from Bruxish, offensively checks Ghost-types, and can facilitate late-game cleaning with Spikes.

    "overview": "<p>Despite its middle-of-the-road Speed tier, Lucario is one of the most dangerous late-game sweepers thanks to its access to strong priority moves like Extreme Speed, Vacuum Wave, and Bullet Punch. Its set versatility makes it hard to play around; for example, Slowbro can be brought in predicting Swords Dance, only to be forced back out after discovering Lucario is running Nasty Plot. Its nearly unresisted STAB combination is often hard to switch into, especially when factoring in Extreme Speed to pick off Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Talonflame and Thundurus. With coverage like Crunch, Earthquake, and Shadow Ball, Lucario is able to beat down should-be checks like Basculegion, Chandelure, and Slowbro, which all resist its STAB combination. Terastallization further enhances Lucario's sweeping potential, giving boosted Extreme Speed the potential to OHKO Talonflame, bulky Noivern, and Choice Scarf Rotom-H as well as unboosted Shadow Ball achieving an OHKO on Slowbro after Stealth Rock. While fragile, Lucario has a great typing with a useful immunity to Poison-type attacks and resistance to common Dark-, Dragon-, and Grass-type moves, which gives it an opportunity to set up against Vileplume, Dragalge, and Brute Bonnet. Unfortunately, however, those moves are still dealing a significant amount of damage to Lucario. Lucario is too reliant on priority due to its Speed tier, as it is outsped by common threats like Flygon, Mienshao, and Krookodile. It is also very susceptible to Talonflame's burn as well as Rocky Helmet users like Slowbro and Vileplume due to its use of contact moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lucario has several other options to help its Speed. Bullet Punch can be used over Meteor Mash as an additional priority move, but it's weak even after a boost and only targets Lycanroc-D and faster, weakened Ghost-types. Trailblaze can be used to boost Lucario's Speed while dealing damage; it also hits Quagsire and Swampert for the most damage, but it still remains a rather weak and niche alternative. Agility can be used in place of Swords Dance and Nasty Plot while running Adamant and Modest, respectively, but without access to moves that boost its offenses further, Lucario has a harder time breaking walls, although it can have an easier time cleaning. Stone Edge can be used to hit Talonflame on the switch, but it doesn't offer much outside of that. While not optimal, Lucario can use Choice Band and Choice Specs to take on a wallbreaker role and have more immediate power; however, it can be easily exploited due to the number of foes that resist Lucario's STAB attacks. Swords Dance Lucario can use Tera Ghost to become immune to Close Combat from common revenge killers like Mienshao, Lycanroc-D, and Infernape, using them as an opportunity to set up, but the damage drop off with Extreme Speed becomes very noticeable. Lucario tends to have issues finding time to set up, so Leftovers can be used to take full advantage of its great defensive typing, giving it some longevity in battle. Lum Berry allows Lucario to play more aggressively against Talonflame without worrying about being burned.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Swampert, Quagsire, and Tera Poison Avalugg all feast on Lucario, being able to switch in on Swords Dance Lucario and either force it out or simply KO it. Slowbro uses Lucario as setup fodder thanks to its great defensive profile, though it can be caught off guard by Nasty Plot variants.</p> <p><strong>Adverse Contact and Status Effects</strong>: Status-inducing abilities like Talonflame's Flame Body, Vileplume's Effect Spore, and Bellibolt's Static all punish Lucario because of its use of contact moves. Lucario also has to be cautious of status moves like Will-O-Wisp from Talonflame and Hisuian Typlosion, Thunder Wave from Slowbro and Klefki, and Stun Spore from Vileplume and Wo-Chien. If Lucario has Terastallized, then it needs to worry about Toxic from Alolan Muk, Vileplume, Umbreon, and Bellibolt. Physical sets rely solely on contact moves, making some matchups against Rocky Helmet users like Slowbro and Vileplume less ideal than they already are.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Basculegion are all immune to Lucario's Close Combat and Extreme Speed while simultaneously resisting Meteor Mash; the former two have to be cautious of Earthquake, while all three should be wary of Crunch. Hisuian Typhlosion will always be faster than Lucario, while Chandelure and Basculegion have to use Choice Scarf to outspeed it, but all of them can easily OHKO Lucario. Users of Tera Ghost like Talonflame, Porygon-Z, and Galvantula hinder Lucario's ability to sweep due to their immunity to most of its moves.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Extreme Speed is Lucario's best friend, enabling it to revenge kill faster, weakened Pokemon like Mienshao, Thundurus, and Munkidori. Crunch gives Lucario super effective coverage to hit Ghost-type Pokemon, which are immune to Close Combat and Extreme Speed, such as Chandelure and Basculegion while simultaneously targeting Slowbro, which is 2HKOed after a Swords Dance boost. Meteor Mash aids Lucario against slower Fighting resistant Pokemon like Sylveon, Dragalge, and Vileplume. Earthquake hits the previously mentioned Dragalge and Chandelure for super effective damage as well as other physical walls such as Bellibolt and Tera Poison Slowbro. Air Balloon can be used over Life Orb to allow Lucario to switch into Choice-locked Earthquake from users like Krookodile and Flygon, giving it a safe opportunity to set up; however, Lucario misses out on Life Orb's extra damage, often forcing it to Terastallize more often than not. Inner Focus lets it ignore Intimidate from Krookodile and Incineroar as well as Ambipom's and Mienshao's Fake Out flinch. Jolly lets Lucario Speed tie with Porygon-Z and Brambleghast, but Adamant gives it a strong damage boost; however, it becomes noticeably slower, getting outpaced by Gallade, Chandelure, and Rotom-H. Tera Normal gives Lucario a much-needed boost to Extreme Speed's power, having the chance to OHKO Talonflame and Flygon. Becoming a Normal-type is great for Lucario offensively, but it isn't great defensively; it no longer walls RestTalk Alolan Muk and Vileplume and loses useful resistances to Dragon-, Dark-, and Grass-type moves, giving the upper hand to Dragalge, Brute Bonnet, Tsareena, and Vileplume; Choice Band Flygon becomes an effective revenge killer due to Lucario no longer resisting First Impression. Defensive Tera from foes like Tera Ghost Talonflame, Tera Poison Wo-Chien and Incineroar, and Tera Steel Noivern are commonly used as counterplay against this set.</p> <p>Sticky Web support from Galvantula greatly benefits Lucario, allowing it to outspeed Lycanroc-D and non-Choice Scarf variants of Krookodile and Mienshao. Lucario also enjoys entry hazards from other dedicated leads on hyper offense teams such as Lycanroc-D and Smeargle. Some other notable partners on those teams include non-lead Lycanroc-D, Thundurus, and Toxtricity, all of which punish some of Lucario's checks like Chandelure, Slowbro, and Swampert; in return, Lucario can KO Mienshao, Alolan Muk, and Sylveon that give them trouble. On bulky offense or balance builds, Lucario appreciates help from slow pivots like Dragalge and Magnezone, which handle the likes of Hisuian Typhlosion, Talonflame, and Vileplume. Knock Off support from Krookodile, Alolan Muk, and Wo-Chien helps wear down Ghost-types like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Basculegion; Wo-Chien is especially noteworthy alongside Vileplume, Umbreon, and Registeel for spreading paralysis, allowing Lucario to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Flygon. Pokemon that can wall Fighting- and Ground-type moves like Slowbro and Talonflame pair nicely with Lucario, giving it more opportunities to switch in and sweep.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Nasty Plot takes advantage of Lucario's higher Special Attack stat and surprises common switch-ins like Slowbro and Chandelure. Lucario is often reliant on priority, so Vacuum Wave is the preferred Fighting-type move, OHKOing faster Pokemon like Shell Smash Cloyster as well as dealing massive damage to other threats like Lycanroc-D and Tera Steel Noivern, both of which can be used to stop Swords Dance Lucario. Aura Sphere, however, is much stronger, letting Lucario more reliably break through walls like Registeel and Copperajah; though without the priority, Lucario becomes much less of a threat. Flash Cannon helps against special walls like Sylveon, Florges, and Dragalge that aren't taking much damage from its other moves. Shadow Ball has great synergy with Lucario's Fighting-type attacks, hitting Fighting-resistant foes like Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Chandelure with super effective damage. Tera Ghost boosts Shadow Ball's damage, giving it a favorable roll to OHKO Slowbro while adding an immunity to Close Combat from revenge killers such as Mienshao, Lycanroc-D, and Infernape. It adds a weakness to Knock Off, however, making Lucario noticeably weaker against Alolan Muk and Tsareena. On the other hand, Tera Fighting helps a lot with the power of Vacuum Wave and Aura Sphere; the former can now OHKO Lycanroc-D as well as Krookodile after Spikes, and the latter can 2HKO specially defensive Swampert while unboosted.</p> <p>While Swords Dance Lucario can hit Fighting-resistant foes with Extreme Speed, Nasty Plot variants suffer due to its only priority being Vacuum Wave; because of this, it appreciates help from Thundurus, Lycanroc-D, and Magnezone to take down faster Fighting-resistant foes like Talonflame, Noivern, and Oricorio-E. Lucario appreciates Sticky Web support from Galvantula to help with its poor Speed, and in return, it can act as an emergency spinblocker with Tera Ghost. It often faces problems breaking past Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Dragalge, so Ground-types like Flygon, Krookodile, and Rhyperior help to knock them out; all three of them can also set Stealth Rock, which punishes Lucario's switch-ins even more. Some physical wallbreakers such as Lycanroc-D, Feraligatr, and Flygon appreciate Lucario's potential to break through Quagsire, Vileplume, and Slowbro; in return, they provide offensive pressure and can break through Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Tera Water Diancie. Slow pivots like Dragalge, Bellibolt, and Incineroar can safely bring in Lucario while providing other utility such as Toxic Spikes, Toxic, and Knock Off, respectively.</p>"

Giga Drain is used for longevity, but Leaf Storm in tandem with Eject Pack works well to pivot and bring in a setup sweeper that can take advantage of its Aurora Veil. Earth Power takes care of Steel-types that can easily switch into Abomasnow safely like Magneton and Tera Steel Appletun. Ice Shard can be used to finish off Pokemon like Scyther and Mesprit, but it can be a wasted moveslot at times because you give up coverage or Aurora Veil. Leech Seed can be used to trade hits more easily with Blissey, which walls Abomasnow otherwise. A Timid nature is key to outspeed Modest Magneton and neutral-nature Samurott. A Choice Specs set can be run, but being locked into one move can be somewhat detrimental due to its Stealth Rock weakness and loss of bulk. Tera Ground helps with boosting Earth Power damage output and gives Abomasnow an Electric immunity for Magneton and Rotom, which use it to gain momentum otherwise.</p> <p>Great partners for Abomasnow are ones that can take care of its Fighting- and Flying-type weaknesses like Scyther, Qwilfish, and Rotom. Hattrem and Drifblim are also exceptional partners that, along with tanking Fighting-type attacks, deny entry hazards for non-Heavy-Duty Boots Abomasnow's longevity. Swords Dance Bruxish and Nasty Plot Mesprit are two good offensive partners that can take advantage of Abomasnow's Aurora Veil once Abomasnow takes care of their checks in Cacturne and Magneton. Tauros and Alolan Raichu also appreciate Abomasnow taking care of their checks like Lurantis and Sandaconda and, in turn, can help with breaking through Steel-types.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its decent Attack stat in combination with Swords Dance and priority Ice Shard, Abomasnow can be a dangerous setup sweeper that takes advantage of the surprise factor that comes with the set, as it usually uses Swords Dance as a special wall like Blissey, Cryogonal, and Eelektross switches in. While Wood Hammer is more powerful, Seed Bomb can be used over it to still threaten Blissey without recoil. Ice Shard picks off weakened, faster threats like Scyther, Hisuian Sneasel, and Lilligant. Earthquake hits the Steel-types that resist Abomasnow’s STAB moves like Magneton and Tera Steel Appletun. Tera Fire allows Abomasnow to resist hits from Scyther, Pyroar, Magneton, and opposing Abomasnow, giving it a free turn to setup or attack while also granting an immunity to Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Drifblim and Rotom. Tera Ground can be used instead to boost the power of Earthquake, give Abomasnow a Stealth Rock resistance, and surprise Electric-types using Volt Switch.</p> <p>Ice Shard allows Abomasnow to take out offensive checks like Hisuian Sneasel and Scyther after a Swords Dance boost with minimal chip. To get this chip, Rocky Helmet Pokemon like Qwilfish and Sandaconda work well with Abomasnow, enabling it to facilitate a sweep. Flying- and Fighting-types like Scyther and Toxicroak threaten Abomasnow out, so checks like Rotom, Sableye, and Sandaconda pair well alongside it. Choice Scarf Mesprit pairs well with Abomasnow, threatening Fighting-types out and giving Abomasnow a second chance to sweep with the aid of Healing Wish. Articuno acts as a hard wall for Abomasnow, as it gets a Defense boost in snow and access to Haze. Pokemon like Magneton and Rotom can take advantage of Articuno by threatening it with Volt Switch to obtain momentum and crippling it with Trick, respectively. Pyroar also deals with Articuno quite well with Taunt, blocking Articuno’s Roost, in combination with Will-O Wisp, which lets Pyroar chip away at it.</p>"

Pollen Puff allows Lilligant to hit Grass-types like Appletun and Lurantis without having to rely on Tera Blast. It also doubles as nice coverage for Pokemon such as Umbreon and Mesprit, which pack the bulk and utility options to hinder a Lilligant sweep. Because Lilligant has Pollen Puff for Grass-types, it uses a Tera Blast type capable of threatening Flying-types, commonly Rock or Electric. Tera Rock has the added benefit of resisting Poison, letting Lilligant more easily deal with Muk or take a Poison-type attack from Hisuian Sneasel or Toxicroak in a pinch. Lilligant can opt to run Encore last in tandem with Tera Electric to take advantage of careless Thunder Wave users like Blissey and Umbreon, locking them into the move and granting Lilligant free setup opportunities. Sleep Powder can be used to grant even more setup opportunities, but without the added coverage, these setup opportunities are often moot.

  "Krookodile": {
    "overview": "<p>Krookodile's Attack, useful utility movepool, and ability to cater to its team's needs by either checking fast threats or punishing and taking advantage of fatter walls solidify its position as one of the top threats of NU. With Intimidate, Krookodile excels at being an entry hazard setter thanks to its ability to maintain pressure while also having access to moves like Knock Off and Taunt to cripple bulkier Pokemon like Talonflame and Vaporeon that could come in freely and take advantage of it. Krookodile's great coverage in Gunk Shot and Stone Edge helps it target Grass-, Fairy-, and Flying-types like Tsareena, Brute Bonnet, Sylveon, and Noivern, which could switch in more easily otherwise. Krookodile puts this coverage to use exceptionally well with its Choice Scarf set, letting it outspeed would-be threats like Inteleon, Basculegion, and Lycanroc-D. The Speed Krookodile gains from Choice Scarf, along with the Attack boosts from Moxie, helps it sweep unprepared teams that can't offensively check it. However, its fairly middling Speed tier means common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Flygon easily outspeed it, and, if Krookodile manages to get a KO, a healthy defensive wall is still usually enough to force it out. Even against resisted attacks, Krookodile tends to take a lot of damage, and it can be overly reliant on Intimidate, meaning taking special attacks is quite difficult. Krookodile also tends to fail to do much to Pokemon like Slowbro and Vileplume after a Knock Off, forcing it to switch out afterward.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Band set on Krookodile can be used, but it tends to get easily revenge killed due to its middling Speed. Rocky Helmet can be run on utility or bulkier sets, but most of the moves Krookodile would want to switch into to take advantage of the item's chip damage would be super effective. With either a Loaded Dice or a Lum Berry, Krookodile can be a dangerous setup sweeper with Moxie and a moveset of Knock Off / Earthquake / Scale Shot / Bulk Up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Mienshao and Infernape both outspeed Krookodile and can finish it with a Close Combat. Lucario can use Choice Scarf Krookodile as set-up fodder, and Gallade can take any hit from it, letting Gallade either setup as well or just KO it. Scrafty also takes advantage of Krookodile by using it as setup fodder as Krookodile fails to do any meaningful damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Tsareena, Brute Bonnet, and Vileplume can take an Earthquake from Krookodile and threaten it with super effective STAB moves; however, the former two should be cautious of Gunk Shot. Torterra outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Krookodile after a Shell Smash and can OHKO it with Bullet Seed.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type physical walls like Swampert, Quagsire, and Slowbro can easily take attacks from Krookodile. Swampert lacks recovery, though, leaving it open to being whittled down over the course of a battle. Slowbro can be forced to Terastallize, however, leaving it open to be hit super effectively by Krookodile's other moves. More offensive Water-types, like Inteleon, Feraligatr, and Cloyster, can threaten to KO Krookodile after either taking a hit or easily outspeeding it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to Krookodile's somewhat middling Speed, it's easily outsped by faster Choice Scarf users even when using one itself. Choice Scarf Mienshao, Infernape, Inteleon, and Flygon all outspeed Krookodile and can threaten to KO with minimal chip damage, if not outright OHKOing it.</p>",

Intimidate provides it extra utility throughout the battle, letting it check physical attackers more easily, while Moxie, in conjunction with Choice Scarf, allows Krookodile to be a deadly wincon that can easily snowball. Tera Poison boosts Gunk Shot and provides Krookodile with defensive utility, letting it survive one Fighting- or Fairy-type attack while helping it take on a common Choice Scarf user in Mienshao.

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With Knock Off Krookodile is a threatening entry hazard setter, as it's able to beat every hazard removal Pokemon in the metagame with the chip damage it racks up. Gunk Shot helps Krookodile deal with Grass-types like Tsareena and Brute Bonnet, but Stone Edge allows Krookodile to hit Flying-type switch-ins such as Noivern and Talonflame. Alternatively, Taunt lets Krookodile stop bulkier Pokemon like Swampert, Diancie, and Vileplume from setting up their hazards or recovering. Unlike Knock Off, Crunch alongside Black Glasses can 2HKO Slowbro after it consumes its Colbur Berry; the trade-off of this combination is that Krookodile then can't cripple item-reliant Pokemon like Talonflame and Swampert. Black Glasses simultaneously boosts Krookodile's Knock Off while also not revealing an item, allowing Krookodile to bluff having a Choice Scarf. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used instead for some recovery. With Tera Poison, Krookodile can check Mienshao and Tsareena in a pinch while boosting Gunk Shot; however, Tera Ghost allows it to be immune to both Fighting-type attacks and Rapid Spin while giving it multiple neutralities. Leading with Stealth Rock Krookodile tends to be detrimental, as common leads carry super effective attacks or U-turn like Mienshao and Flygon.</p> <p>Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Infernape easily outspeed Krookodile and threaten it with Close Combat, so pairing it with teammates like Dragalge, Slowbro, and Talonflame helps to alleviate this weakness. Bulky Grass- and Water-types like Tsareena, Vileplume, and Swampert are difficult for Krookodile to deal with, meaning it enjoys the support of Pokemon like Chandelure, Noivern, and Rotom-C. Special attackers like Inteleon, Venusaur, and Florges easily scare out Krookodile, so special walls like Copperajah, Magnezone, and Assault Vest Slowbro help take on these threats. With how easily Krookodile removes items, Spikes setters like Klefki and Brambleghast pair well with it, helping to weaken the opposing team. Pokemon such as Mienshao, Munkidori, and Gallade that take advantage of Krookodile's ability to take on Psychic- and Ghost-type attackers work well with it.

Its staying power is further bolstered by a combination of Regenerator, Magic Guard, and Recover. Psyshock and Focus Blast hit most of the tier for at least neutral damage, and Knock Off and Future Sight are useful utility. Psychic Noise allows Reuniclus to beat bulkier foes that would otherwise out-heal its damage. Energy Ball can also be a useful option, hitting several Psychic-resistant foes in the tier, including Slowbro and Krookodile. Dark-types like Alolan Muk and Krookodile can be problematic, however, due to their ability to hit Reuniclus hard with Knock Off. Psychic types like Slowbro and Mew can also be difficult, as they resist both of Reuniclus's main attacking options. Ghost-types, particularly strong attackers like Chandelure and Brambleghast seriously threaten Reuniclus as well.

Future Sight can hit potential threats to Reuniclus after it has already switched out, which can be particularly overwhelming when combined with powerful physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Krookodile and Lycanroc-Dusk. Focus Blast 2HKOes the Steel- and Dark-types like Magnezone and Krookodile that might otherwise try to switch into Reuniclus's Psychic-type attacks,and it can nearly OHKO the latter. Energy Ball hits several bulky Pokemon that might switch into Reuniclus — most notably Slowbro, which is almost always 2HKOed — but outside of hitting Krookodile, makes Reuniclus's matchups against Dark and Steel-types like Incineroar and Registeel much worse. Knock Off provides excellent utility in removing the items of potential switch-ins like Incineroar and Mew. The given EV spread helps Reuniclus outspeed Quagsire and Slowbro, so it can beat them one-on-one with Psychic Noise. The rest is poured into Special Defense to maximize bulk. Tera Dark and Tera Fairy both allow Reuniclus to resist types normally super effective against it, such as Ghost and Dark. Tera Steel and Tera Dragon both work to resist strong neutral attacks from common special attackers, including Boomburst from Toxtricity as well as Grass- and Fire-type attacks from sun sweepers like Venusaur, Scovillain, and Typhlosion.</p> <p>Reuniclus benefits from teammates that can switch into dangerous Dark-types like Alolan Muk and Krookodile. Vileplume does well into both, threatening Effect Spore activations on Knock Off while not fearing poison from Alolan Muk. Offensively, Reuniclus benefits from Fighting-types like Mienshao and Gallade that can eliminate Steel- and Dark-types that would switch into Future Sight, like Copperajah, Magnezone, Krookodile, and Brute Bonnet. Gallade also seriously threatens Slowbro with Leaf Blade, which can try to pivot through Reuniclus's attacks as well. Pivots like Thundurus that can bait in foes like Alolan Muk and Krookodile and chip them down can also make Reuniclus's life much easier.

Colbur Berry can help Reuniclus take a Knock Off from Krookodile and Incineroar and respond with a free Focus Blast.

Its great Speed paired with Choice Scarf lets it outspeed unboosted Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Talonflame as well as boosted sweepers like Shell Smash Torterra and Dragon Dance Feraligatr. Knock Off punishes Mienshao's switch-ins like Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Talonflame as well as Ghost-types that are immune to Close Combat like Chandelure and Brambleghast, while other coverage options like Stone Edge, Ice Spinner, and Poison Jab hit Flying- and Fairy-type switch-ins with super effective damage. On top of that, Regenerator pushes Mienshao above the competition, effectively letting it ignore entry hazards on the switch. Mienshao often plays into high-risk, high-reward scenarios; the threat of using Close Combat is high, as Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Talonflame, Slowbro, and Vileplume can all switch in and punish it with Flame Body, Rocky Helmet, and Effect Spore, respectively. Even with the risk of Rocky Helmet, Mienshao can still pivot with U-turn on predicted switches, giving it the upper hand.

Fake Out is an option for Life Orb Mienshao to revenge kill faster, weaker threats like Thundurus, Agility Gallade, and Chlorophyll Venusaur, but it loses out on the power of Swords Dance and momentum of U-turn. Lastly, Triple Axel can be used over Ice Spinner for a stronger Ice-type move, but it is less reliable. Assault Vest is another option on the wallbreaker set, giving Mienshao more longevity against special wallbreakers and revenge killers like Noivern and Infernape.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon like Talonflame and Noivern outspeed non-Choice Scarf Mienshao, can switch into Close Combat, and threaten an OHKO with Brave Bird and Hurricane, respectively. Talonflame is also able to punish Mienshao thanks to Flame Body having a chance to burn. Oricorio-E is freely able to set up against a Choice-locked Mienshao, but it is 2HKOed by Tera Fighting Close Combat unless it runs a very bulky EV spread.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Chandelure, Basculegion, and Brambleghast can safely switch in against Choice Scarf Mienshao that is locked into Close Combat and threaten it with an OHKO, but they all have to take caution against Knock Off and the possibility of Mienshao not running Choice Scarf, except Choice Scarf Chandelure and Basculegion.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Vileplume walls Mienshao thanks to adverse damage over time through Rocky Helmet, Toxic, and Leech Seed; it can also restore all of its HP while simultaneously making Mienshao weaker with Strength Sap. Munkidori resists Close Combat and is naturally faster than Mienshao, often forcing it out by bluffing Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Slowbro, Reuniclus, and bulky Mew resist Mienshao's Close Combat and can force awkward predictions even while they are not on the field. They are all weak to Knock Off but can take the hit with Tera Fairy or Tera Poison and then use Mienshao as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Blanket physical walls such as Slowbro, Avalugg, and Quagsire can make it hard for Mienshao to break through bulkier teams, as they can recover their HP easily and Terastallize if needed. Bulky Fairy-types like Sylveon and Florges resist most of Mienshao's moves, being able to exploit non-Poison Jab variants.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Tera Normal Lucario and Arcanine as well as Aqua Jet Feraligatr and Basculegion all possess strong priority to revenge kill Mienshao, often forcing it to switch out or Terastallize in situations it wouldn't want to. If Mienshao loses its Fighting typing because of Tera, it can become susceptible to Lycanroc-D's Accelerock, too.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf Mienshao doesn't have this issue as much as the wallbreaker set, but Choice Scarf users like Munkidori and Infernape as well as Venusaur under sun will always outspeed Mienshao, giving them the opportunity to revenge kill it. Life Orb Mienshao is also outsped by Espeon, Lycanroc-D, Thundurus, and Noivern, all of which threaten it with a KO.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf boosts Mienshao's Speed to become a premier revenge killer, outspeeding the faster threats in the tier like Lycanroc-D, Noivern, and Thundurus. With passable bulk paired with Regenerator, Choice Scarf Mienshao is a great lead, achieving an OHKO or 2HKO against most entry hazard setters and Choice Scarf leads like Flygon and Krookodile. Knock Off punishes Ghost- and Psychic-types like Basculegion, Chandelure, Slowbro, and Mew that try to switch in on Close Combat, while U-turn gives Mienshao momentum through pivoting and hits Mew and Slowbro with super effective damage. Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Talonflame and bulky Noivern that want to punish Mienshao using Close Combat. Ice Spinner hits the previously mentioned Noivern as well as Grass- and Dragon-types like Brambleghast, Tsareena, and Dragalge, but it's usually best to use U-turn against them to bring in a better check or generally keep up momentum and weaken them at the same time. Poison Jab can be used for Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Tera Fairy Slowbro; this is not preferred because it isn't strong and can be exploited by Steel-types like Registeel, Lucario, and Magnezone as well as other Poison-resistant Pokemon like Rhyperior, Krookodile, and Dragalge. Regenerator gives Mienshao a lot of longevity that it normally wouldn't have with its other abilities, letting it switch in on weaker attacks and hazards without worrying about losing HP. Tera Fighting gives Mienshao's Close Combat a lot of extra power, allowing it to 2HKO Quagsire, Noivern, and Rhyperior, as well as having a roll to 2HKO Swampert. Tera Dark boosts Knock Off's damage and defensively helps Mienshao against Psychic-types like Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Mew while gaining an immunity to Klefki's Thunder Wave; however, it loses its resistance to Lycanroc-D's Accelerock.</p> <p>Mienshao appreciates being able to pivot into Pokemon that can take strong hits from Ghost-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types like Incineroar, Swampert, Dragalge, and Munkidori, all of which can pivot back into Mienshao if needed. Munkidori is most noteworthy because of its Toxic Chain ability, spreading Toxic on its U-turns to cripple Mienshao's Fairy- and Psychic-type checks like Sylveon, Slowbro, and bulky Mew. This interaction can weaken the Close Combat switch-ins enough to enable Mienshao to freely click Close Combat later in the battle. Offensive threats that lure in Fairy-types like Choice Specs Noivern, Mew, Tera Poison Krookodile, and Tera Steel Flygon help at eliminating Mienshao's checks without weakening it or wasting Close Combat's PP. Choice Scarf variants of Munkidori and Infernape are often what will be used to revenge kill Mienshao; as such Slowbro is a good partner, resisting Munkidori's Psychic and both of Infernape's STAB attacks. Slowbro and Reuniclus have natural synergy with Mienshao thanks to Regenerator; they can use Future Sight and pivot into Mienshao to threaten Poison-type switch-ins like Vileplume and Dragalge, while Mienshao threatens the Dark-types that try to absorb Future Sight, like Krookodile and Alolan Muk. Mienshao isn't weak to entry hazards thanks to Regenerator, but it is weak to teams that take advantage of it being Choice locked. With that in mind, having a grounded Poison-type like Vileplume or Alolan Muk and a Defog user like Talonflame or Noivern really helps Mienshao stick around for longer, not having to rely so heavily on Regenerator. Pokemon that can take hits from Mienshao's hard switch-ins like Slowbro, Talonflame, and Vileplume are needed for its longevity, so Pokemon like Alolan Muk, Mew, Swampert, and Magnezone all pair nicely with it. Due to Mienshao's main role as a pivot, it pairs well with fast wallbreakers like Lycanroc-D, Munkidori, and Thundurus, which threaten Mienshao's checks. Mienshao can't do much to physical walls like Slowbro, Vileplume, and Tera Poison Avalugg, so it enjoys partnering with strong special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Mew, and Toxtricity. These wallbreakers aren't known for their speed and appreciate Mienshao KOing fast Pokemon like Lycanroc-D, Thundurus, and Noivern. Chandelure and Mew can also switch into Choice Scarf Infernape's Close Combat, preserving some momentum.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb boosts Mienshao's power a lot with little drawback thanks to Regenerator, giving it the opportunity to 2HKO Quagsire as well as OHKO Mew and Tsareena after some prior damage. Close Combat and Knock Off make a nearly unresisted combination; the latter enables Mienshao to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types that switch in on Close Combat like Chandelure, Brambleghast, Slowbro, and Mew. Close Combat and Knock Off synergize better with Life Orb than Choice Scarf thanks to Mienshao not being locked into one move, giving it a better fighting chance against Psychic- and Ghost-type switch-ins. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types like Sylveon and Florges as well as Tera Fairy users like Slowbro and Rhyperior. Swords Dance boosts Mienshao's already high Attack, giving it more of a chance to break past physical walls like Slowbro, Swampert, and Vileplume. U-turn retains Mienshao's strong pivoting capability without forcing it to lock into a single move, but it causes Mienshao to lose out on the power of Swords Dance. Regenerator gives Mienshao more opportunities to wallbreak while not caring too much about damage from entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, and Life Orb. Tera Poison boosts Poison Jab's damage, allowing it to OHKO Tsareena and Tera Fairy Slowbro after a Swords Dance boost. Tera Ghost gives Mienshao many immunities to moves to revenge killers like Close Combat from Lycanroc-D and Infernape, Vacuum Wave from Lucario and Mew, and Extreme Speed from Lucario; however, it becomes weak to Brute Bonnet's Sucker Punch and no longer resists Lycanroc-D's Accelerock.</p> <p>Swords Dance Mienshao appreciates entry hazard support from Swampert, Rhyperior, Klefki, and Dragalge to guarantee some KOs it otherwise would not obtain. Toxic Spikes in particular help to break through physical walls like Swampert, Rhyperior, and Sylveon, which cannot afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots. Future Sight support from Slowbro and Reuniclus can punish Poison-types and Tera Poison users that try to wall Mienshao like Vileplume, Quagsire, and Avalugg, while Mienshao punishes Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Krookodile that try to absorb Future Sight. Faster Pokemon like Talonflame, Noivern, and Raikou can revenge kill Mienshao, which opens up room for various different walls like Diancie, Slowbro, Registeel, and Alolan Muk to be paired alongside it. Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, Flygon, and Basculegion can all work to KO Pokemon that try to use their higher Speed to force Mienshao to switch. Slow pivots like Dragalge, Swampert, and Eject Button Slowbro can all safely bring in Mienshao. If running U-turn, Dark-types like Krookodile, Alolan Muk, and Incineroar can all be brought in safely on a predicted Psychic-type move from Slowbro, Reuniclus, or Mew. A status absorber, especially one that can absorb burns, is very useful to keep Mienshao healthy enough to wallbreak at any time; thus, it naturally pairs well with Milotic, Rest Alolan Muk, and Magic Guard Reuniclus.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus is a fantastic option on offensive teams thanks to its great mixed offensive stats, excellent Speed tier, amazing offensive movepool, and valuable Ground immunity. It can tweak its moveset to have coverage for just about any defensive check to it, and it's able to set up on some of the most common Choice Scarf users in Krookodile and Flygon. Sadly, though, this defensive utility is a bit hard to make use of, as Thundurus is quite frail and vulnerable to super effective coverage like Krookodile's and Flygon's Stone Edge. In fact, this fragility is such an issue that Mienshao's Tera Fighting Close Combat almost always 2HKOes Thundurus. Additionally, it's very vulnerable to Lycanroc-D's Accelerock as well as other fast attackers like Noivern and Choice Scarf Hisuian Typhlosion.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thundurus is not restricted to only being a special attacker and can instead use powerful physical moves to take advantage of unsuspecting foes. STAB Acrobatics allows Thundurus to break through Grass-types that typically give it trouble, like Tsareena and Wo-Chien. This can be accomplished by running an itemless pivot set or a setup sweeper set with Bulk Up + Sitrus Berry or the more gimmicky Swagger + Mirror Herb. It's worth noting, though, that this means Thundurus will take Stealth Rock damage, becoming much easier to revenge kill. Despite its weakness to Stealth Rock, Thundurus can still have a niche as a Choice Scarf user. Its particularly useful Speed tier allows it to outspeed Jolly Cloyster after a Shell Smash, as well as being faster than every other relevant Choice Scarf Pokemon in NU. This Speed can catch an opponent off guard, and with access to two different pivoting moves, it can keep them on the back foot. Thundurus is an acceptable rain setter, with its Electric-type moves threatening bulky Water-types for other attackers like Basculegion and Kingdra, and its U-turn chipping away at shared checks like Tsareena, Vileplume, and Wo-Chien. Finally, Nasty Plot sets can also be used effectively on weather teams by running Weather Ball as a coverage option. Snow gives Thundurus BoltBeam coverage, while rain and sun provide an effective 150-Base Power coverage move as well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: While Thundurus does have a great Speed tier, its poor bulk leaves it vulnerable to revenge killers like Choice Scarf Mienshao and Krookodile and powerful priority moves such as Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Lucario's Extreme Speed. These foes often force Thundurus to Terastallize, which can result in disaster if the opponent predicts correctly. Weather sweepers like Venusaur and Kingdra also pose a great threat, especially if Thundurus lacks Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong> An unboosted Thundurus can't OHKO Speed-boosting sweepers such as Dragon Dance Flygon and Shell Smash Torterra and is too frail to survive boosted hits. While Thunder Wave can be used to slow down other threats that aren't immune to paralysis, it is often not a worthwhile trade because Thundurus is likely to faint in the process.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Thundurus has many potent coverage options but is unable to cover every defensive threat with just one moveset. Grass Knot is necessary to pressure Rhyperior, Focus Blast is necessary to break through Magnezone, Psychic is needed to deal significant damage to Vileplume and Dragalge, and Flash Cannon smashes Diancie. Additionally, pivot sets may lack the coverage and raw firepower to break many of the same threats, which can lead to a loss of momentum. Also, many generic special walls like Assault Vest Reuniclus and Alolan Muk lack weaknesses to Thundurus's common special attacks and retaliate effectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Blast gives Thundurus a high-power attack that hits many foes for strong neutral damage without the commitment of Terastallizing. It also super effectively damages several targets that are immune to or resist Thunderbolt, like Krookodile, Rhyperior, Magnezone, and Brute Bonnet. Without Focus Blast, the latter two can effectively wall Thundurus and threaten to KO it in return. Grass Knot is another option to hit Ground- and Rock-types super effectively, particularly those with a 4x Grass weakness like Swampert, Rhyperior, and Quagsire. Flash Cannon takes advantage of the STAB boost from Tera Steel, providing a more accurate and decently powerful attack that hits many targets for neutral damage. Notably, this allows Thundurus to break through Diancie, which threatens to KO Thundurus with Diamond Storm or, if Thundurus has Terastallized, Body Press. Lastly, Psychic directly targets Dragalge and Vileplume, but Tera Steel Flash Cannon is often more than enough to deal with them. In addition to buffing Flash Cannon's damage, Tera Steel also affords Thundurus more setup opportunities against foes like Vileplume and Tsareena and prevents Lycanroc-D's Accelerock from revenge killing it as easily. Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred to keep Thundurus out of KO range from Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Krookodile, but Life Orb helps defeat checks like Dragalge and Assault Vest Gallade.</p> <p>The goal of using Nasty Plot Thundurus is to take advantage of free setup turns and sweep through weakened teams. For this reason, it is best used on hyper offense teams with other threatening setup sweepers such as Cloyster and Lycanroc-D. Like with any hyper offense team, a reliable entry hazard lead like Sticky Web Galvantula can give Thundurus and its teammates some protection against revenge killing from grounded Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Krookodile, and Munkidori, while a lead like Spikes Brambleghast, Stealth Rock Lycanroc, or Meteor Beam Mew can weaken foes just enough to put them within range of some moves after a boost. Finally, allies like Grimmsnarl and Choice Scarf Chandelure with stat-lowering moves like Parting Shot and Memento can weaken foes to the point where Thundurus can take a hit while setting up.</p>"
      },
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Grass Knot is excellent for hitting Ground-types like Swampert, Rhyperior, and Krookodile. U-turn is the preferred pivoting move for Thundurus, as it cannot be blocked by Ground-types and deals considerable damage to Grass-types like Tsareena, Brute Bonnet, and Wo-Chien, even without significant Attack investment. Alternatively, Volt Switch takes advantage of Thundurus's higher Special Attack and becomes a reliable way to weaken the enemy team once any Electric-immune Pokemon have been removed. Knock Off is one of Thundurus's most consistent progress-making tools, cutting down the longevity of bulky teams by removing key items like Leftovers, Assault Vest, and Heavy-Duty Boots. It also threatens to remove offensive items like Choice Scarf from foes that can't OHKO Thundurus like Flygon, leaving your own sweepers and Choice Scarf users less vulnerable to being revenge killed. In a pinch, Thundurus can use a priority Taunt or Thunder Wave with the help of Prankster, though the loss of coverage is quite detrimental. Tera Steel makes it harder for certain foes like Lycanroc-D and Noivern to revenge kill Thundurus, although it means Thundurus can no longer pivot into Choice-locked Earthquake from foes like Krookodile and Flygon. Since many Choice Scarf users barely pick up the KO against uninvested Thundurus, a slightly bulkier EV spread can be an effective choice. A spread like 116 HP / 20 Def / 120 SpA / 252 Spe survives hits from common Choice Scarf users from full HP like Chandelure's Overheat, Hisuian Typhlosion's Eruption, and Mienshao's and Krookodile's Stone Edge, at the cost of a reduced damage output.</p> <p>As an offensive pivot, Thundurus excels on teams that apply pressure through stacking entry hazards. For this reason, Klefki can be used to switch into super effective attacks aimed at Thundurus, and in return, Thundurus maximizes the effectiveness of Klefki's Spikes through forcing switches and removing durability items with Knock Off. Thundurus also pairs well with powerful physical wallbreakers such as Gallade, Lycanroc-D, and Choice Band Flygon. Thundurus can lure in walls that would typically check it while using U-turn to put its teammates in a position to deal massive damage. Similarly, Thundurus's U-turn frequently weakens foes like Alolan Muk, Tsareena, and Vileplume that expect a different attack, which benefits teammates such as Munkidori, Basculegion, and Flygon.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>In a tier with a number of powerful entry hazard setters, Talonflame soars to the top as a premier pivot with U-turn, spreading burns everywhere it goes with Will-O-Wisp while also being able to remove hazards with Defog. However, Talonflame is not only reserved as a utility option; it can act as a physical wall in a pinch thanks to its ability Flame Body and can invest in its bulk without losing out on Speed or power thanks to its high-Base Power STAB attacks like Brave Bird and Flare Blitz. Talonflame can force out Stealth Rock and Spikes setters like Registeel, Brambleghast, and Klefki by threatening them with Will-O-Wisp and using Defog to remove their hazards. Thanks to its high Speed, it can revenge kill fast threats like non-Choice Scarf variants of Mienshao, Flygon, and Infernape. However, its low offenses really stand out when trying to revenge kill bulkier wallbreakers and Pokemon that resist its STAB moves like Incineroar, Chandelure, and Oricorio-E, all of which can shrug off its attacks and don't care about being burned. Talonflame's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots is made apparent when it commonly switches into Knock Off users like Mienshao, Copperajah, and Infernape, forcing it to take hazard damage every time it wants to switch in again. Talonflame's poor typing allows most other hazard setters to set up against it for free, like Swampert, Diancie, and Lycanroc-D.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Talonflame can opt for Taunt over Will-O-Wisp, stopping any setup attempts from the likes of bulky Cresselia, Registeel, and Deoxys-D, but it makes Talonflame a little more passive, especially since it isn't dealing much damage to those Pokemon regardless. Overheat or Flamethrower can be used instead of the other two STAB attacks to hit Vileplume without worrying about Rocky Helmet and Effect Spore, but Overheat's poor accuracy paired with Talonflame's really low Special Attack stat makes it undesirable against most of the tier. Talonflame can boost its Attack with Swords Dance and Bulk Up, which allows it to use Gale Wings's priority boost; however, even after a boost, it is still weak and relies on less-than-ideal moves to sweep with.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Bellibolt, Oricorio-E, and Toxtricity have a positive matchup against Talonflame, as they can take a hit from its STAB attacks at any time and threaten to KO it or set up. Rotom-H is especially tricky for Talonflame, as it resists both of its STAB attacks, is immune to burn, and can give it a Choice Scarf with Trick, acting as a hard wall to it.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Common Knock Off users, like Copperajah, Alolan Muk, and Mienshao, and Trick users, like Porygon-Z, Rotom-H, and Florges can remove Talonflame's Heavy-Duty Boots, forcing it to take Stealth Rock damage every time it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Diancie is an entry hazard setter that beats Talonflame thanks to its Rock-type STAB attacks OHKOing it, freely letting it come in and set up hazards any time Talonflame is on the field. Lycanroc-D is also noteworthy thanks to its strong priority move Accelerock, although it has to worry about being burned.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon and Milotic can tank hits from Talonflame, heal the damage off with ease, and retaliate with Scald. Offensive Water-types like Feraligatr, Basculegion, and Inteleon can also threaten Talonflame, but the former two don't like to be burned, and the latter is quite frail.</p>",

Brave Bird additionally hits Fighting-types and Fire-resistant Pokemon like Mienshao, Chandelure, and Flygon. Flare Blitz is better against entry hazard setters; enables Talonflame to hit Steel-types and Flying-resistant Pokemon like Copperajah, Klefki, and Oricorio-E for more damage; and has a small chance to burn. Will-O-Wisp is a more reliable way of burning foes than Flame Body, letting Talonflame burn common switch-ins like Dragalge, Vaporeon, and Diancie and threaten hazard setters that often come in like Swampert, Diancie, and Dragalge. Tera Ghost gifts Talonflame an immunity to Lucario's Extreme Speed and to other priority moves like Breloom's Mach Punch, and it ensures its low Defense isn't taken advantage of by powerful Choice Scarf Fighting-types like Infernape and Mienshao. Tera Steel, on the other hand, trades Talonflame's immunity to Lucario's Extreme Speed into a resistance for an added resistance to Lycanroc-D's Accelerock while also granting a resistance to Stealth Rock should it lose its item; Talonflame can also become a pseudo-check to some special wallbreakers like Munkidori, Indeedee, and Dragalge with Tera Steel.</p> <p>Talonflame's main role is to pivot, and thanks to it drawing in Electric- and Rock-type Pokemon, it pairs well with Ground- and Grass-types like Flygon, Vileplume, and Brute Bonnet, which can all exploit its switch-ins. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal like Alolan Muk, Vileplume, and Gallade also pair well with it. Talonflame also enjoys tanking Fighting-type moves from Mienshao, Infernape, and Lucario, so teammates like Lycanroc-D, Incineroar, and Registeel appreciate its presence in battle. Due to its passivity, Talonflame draws in Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon, which leverages room for Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon like Toxtricity, Rotom-C, and Tsareena to switch in. Bulky offense teams appreciate Talonflame's ability to lure in Electric- and Rock-types due to their passivity in certain matchups, so pivoting into Torterra, Flygon, and Swampert can help create momentum. On balanced structures, Talonflame enjoys having switch-ins for Pokemon like Indeedee and Dragalge, so Steel- and Fairy-types like Registeel, Copperajah, Klefki, and Sylveon synergize well with it. Diancie, Swampert, and Gastrodon can set up hazards in front of Talonflame without trouble, so Water- and Grass-types like Feraligatr, Basculegion, Brute Bonnet, and Vileplume can help by safely switching into and threatening to KO these foes.</p>"

Sleep Powder enables Vivillon to cripple opposing Pokemon that may otherwise check it, such as Eelektross and Drifblim, and give it the free turn needed to set up a Quiver Dance. Substitute is an option to ease setup by helping Vivillon play around the uncertainty of sleep turns and dodge status. Bug Buzz targets Pokemon such as Umbreon and Hattrem, which can otherwise cut Vivillon's sweep short with Thunder Wave or Nuzzle. Finally, Tera Blast with Tera Ground does heavy damage to Muk and outright OHKOes Magneton. Vivillon's very poor overall bulk makes Focus Sash a good option, as it guarantees a Quiver Dance boost or the ability to put a foe to sleep. However, if your team lacks multiple forms of entry hazard removal, Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred. Compound Eyes boosts the otherwise shaky accuracy of Sleep Powder and Hurricane, making them far more reliable. A Timid nature is preferred over a Modest nature to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Indeedee-F, Passimian, and Medicham after a Quiver Dance and outspeed and threaten an OHKO on offensive threats like Toxicroak and Mabosstiff unboosted. Tera Ground allows Vivillon to turn the tables on Volt Switch users such as Jolteon and Rotom and also helps it survive Accelerock from Lycanroc. Alternatively, Tera Ghost along with Substitute allows Vivillon to set up against Chansey, which would normally wall it, and Tera Flying can be used to power up Vivillon's Hurricane.</p> <p>If Vivillon is running Focus Sash over Heavy-Duty Boots, strong hazard control is key, so Hattrem, which prevents opposing hazards through Magic Bounce, and other hazard removal options such as Drifblim and Lurantis are mandatory. Special walls such as Chansey and Eelektross are a serious obstacle for Vivillon to overcome, with the former's Natural Cure negating the effect of Sleep Powder, so physical wallbreakers that can take advantage of them like Toxicroak, Paldean Tauros, and Ursaring make for great partners. Trick users, such as Rotom and Zoroark, can also bait in these foes and cripple them by giving them a Choice item, with Rotom deserving special mention for inviting in Lurantis and Appletun, which gives a Vivillon relatively free setup opportunity. Spikes support from the likes of Qwilfish and Cacturne is also appreciated to help wear down answers to Vivillon over time. Strong setup sweepers like Veluza, Dudunsparce, and Lycanroc, which all appreciate foes being put to sleep, also make for powerful partners in conjunction with Vivillon.</p>"

On the other hand, Choice Specs sets provide a ton of nuking power with Adaptability, allowing Dragalge to break through former counters like Umbreon and Registeel. However, Dragalge lacks good Speed, meaning it often can't retaliate before strong attackers overwhelm it.

A moveset consisting of Substitute / Sludge Bomb / Dragon Pulse / Focus Blast or Tera Blast Ground can be used with Leftovers to significantly capitalize on forced switches and take advantage of more passive Pokemon. But this can hurt Dragalge's longevity quite a bit, and, in general, opportunities aren’t too common.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Flygon and Torterra are difficult to handle for Dragalge, as they’re always faster and can hit it with their powerful STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Registeel and Tera Steel Sylveon wall Dragalge's STAB moves, meaning they can come in and take advantage of it often and only fear Focus Blast. Also, Klefki loves to come in on any of Dragalge’s attacks and spread status or set Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Dragalge struggles against the plethora of Psychic-types like Gallade, Indeedee, and Munkidori. All of these Pokemon easily scare out Dragalge with their Psychic-type STAB moves and also tend to be able to take a hit from it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Gallade, Bronzong, and Diancie take on Dragalge’s attacks easily and can threaten it with Knock Off, super effective damage, or a physical attack. All of these Pokemon don’t have a very reliable source of healing, though, so they tend to be whittled down over the course of a battle.</p>",

Flip Turn works amazingly on Dragalge, letting it act as a bulky pivot that can bring in powerful wallbreakers. The given EV spread allows Dragalge to outspeed Vileplume while giving it some physical bulk to aid with Fighting-types like Mienshao and Infernape. Tera Steel allows Dragalge to take Psychic-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks from foes like Munkidori, Sylveon, and opposing Dragalge. On the other hand, Tera Water alleviates its weakness to Ground-type attacks while giving it an overall strong defensive typing.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes lowers switch rates when your opponent tries to play around them, so Pokemon that can scare out Poison-types and cause switches like Flygon and Future Sight Galarian Articuno can overwhelm your opponents. Partners that can bring in physically defensive Pokemon such as Mienshao and Infernape gift Dragalge with chances to set Toxic Spikes. In the face of Steel-types like Klefki and Copperajah, Dragalge fails to do much, so partners that can take advantage of its Flip Turn and deal with these pests, like Gallade, Mienshao, and Flare Blitz Talonflame, work well. Opposing Dragon- and Fairy-type Pokemon also cause issues for Dragalge, as they’re usually faster and can severely damage or KO Dragalge before it can react. Teammates that help alleviate this weakness such as Sylveon, Registeel, and Copperajah are appreciated. Dragalge’s limited HP also hinders it; to ensure its survival for longer, entry hazard removers or Wish users like Talonflame, Brambleghast, and Vaporeon can be used. Pokemon like Vileplume and Tsareena that can handle more offensive Ground-types such as Flygon and Torterra can help out Dragalge.</p>"

Tera Blast Ground can be used instead to hit these targets more accurately and powerfully along with Alolan Muk; however, this comes at the cost of Terastallizing, making it not as favored of an option overall. For the last move, a way to pivot in Flip Turn is preferred to bring a partner in on a wall it would otherwise have trouble with. The given EVs let Dragalge outpace Vaporeon and Umbreon with the rest poured into HP. An alternative and bulkier EV spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe can be run, as it gives Dragalge enough Speed to outrun uninvested Sylveon. Tera Poison grants Dragalge a resistance to Fairy while also powering Sludge Wave to preposterous levels; however, a more defensive Tera type like Tera Steel could be used to help Dragalge retaliate after surviving Psychic- and Dragon-type attacks.</p> <p>Dragalge’s low Speed tends to hinder it a lot, but this can be negated with pivot cores. Dragalge draws in Steel-types, but it can use Flip Turn to let Mienshao or Flygon handle them.

Dragalge can also whittle down Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel over time with a strong Focus Blast, so Pokemon that can take advantage of this such as Munkidori, Reuniclus, and Calm Mind Sylveon enjoy its presence. Special walls like Alolan Muk, Gastrodon, and Registeel love to come in on Dragalge, so strong physical wallbreakers like Gallade and Incineroar work well to deal with these checks.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Lycanroc-D is one of the most effective revenge killers and wallbreakers that NU has to offer. It boasts one of the best base Speed stats in the tier and carries strong STAB priority in Accelerock for faster foes. Its strong, Tough Claws-boosted attacks, often boosted further by Swords Dance, deal immense damage even to neutral targets. It also has fantastic coverage, with Close Combat to burst through physical walls like Avalugg and Registeel, Crunch to break Slowbro and Reuniclus, and Psychic Fangs to crack Vileplume or Dragalge. The sheer variety of coverage available to it, including options like Sucker Punch and Stone Edge, makes predicting and countering Lycanroc-D incredibly difficult. Lycanroc-D's poor bulk is its main weakness; it can struggle to cleanly switch in, and finding time to set up a Swords Dance can be difficult. Life Orb recoil and entry hazards can further wear it down, limiting Lycanroc-D's staying power. Lycanroc-D can also be revenge killed by several of the Choice Scarf users in the tier, notably Mienshao, Flygon, and Krookodile. Walls like Swampert and Vileplume can also take a few hits if Lycanroc-D cannot set up with Swords Dance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lycanroc-D can use Tera Ghost defensively in order to avoid Close Combat from revenge killing threats like Mienshao, but offensive Tera types are preferred to maximize damage output. A Focus Sash lead set with Stealth Rock / Accelerock / Close Combat / Taunt is a great enabler of hyper offense teams, as Lycanroc-D is still quite strong without a boosting move or item and is fast enough to reliably set its entry hazard.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Vileplume switches into most of Lycanroc-D's moves well, with the exception of Psychic Fangs. Rocky Helmet chip damage helps further wear Lycanroc-D down, and Effect Spore has the potential to activate on every one of Lycanroc-D's attacking options besides Stone Edge. Bulky Tsareena can take Close Combat, is immune to Accelerock, and can threaten Lycanroc-D with Rapid Spin or an OHKO with Power Whip. Venusaur in sun can also outspeed and threaten Lycanroc-D.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, Swampert, and Quagsire all take at least one hit from Lycanroc-D and threaten it back with super effective damage. Feraligatr and Basculegion can also threaten it offensively with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Swampert and Quagsire tank unboosted Close Combat adequately, while Flygon and Krookodile are capable of switching into anything but Close Combat while often using Choice Scarf to outspeed and potentially OHKO Lycanroc-D with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Very few threats in the tier can naturally outspeed Lycanroc-D, but for those that do, Lycanroc-D is forced to use a relatively weak priority move in Accelerock. Raikou, along with Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Flygon, can take an Accelerock and threaten Lycanroc-D back with super effective attacks.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lycanroc-D has significant power and Speed without any boosts, but Swords Dance pushes it even further. Accelerock is a strong priority STAB move that hits faster Pokemon like Talonflame, Noivern, and Thundurus for super effective damage. Close Combat is an excellent coverage move that hits large portions of the tier for neutral or super effective damage. Notably, it hits walls such as Avalugg and Registeel, almost always OHKOing Avalugg at +2. Pokemon resistant to Accelerock, such as Swampert and Rhyperior, also dislike switching into Close Combat, particularly after a Swords Dance boost. The addition of Tera Fighting allows an unboosted Lycanroc-D to 2HKO Swampert and Quagsire. Sucker Punch can replace Close Combat for an even stronger priority move on Tera Dark variants, letting Lycanroc-D OHKO Choice Scarf Mienshao. Crunch, often in combination with Tera Dark, allows Lycanroc-D to OHKO Slowbro at +2 after Stealth Rock, and always OHKOes Reuniclus. Alternatively, Psychic Fangs beats Poison-types like Vileplume, defensive Dragalge, and Tera Poison Slowbro with ease. Life Orb provides some immediate power without the boost of Swords Dance, giving it solid revenge killing potential upon entering the field.</p> <p>One of Lycanroc-D's primary weaknesses is its bulk, which makes it difficult to switch in, particularly when it also takes entry hazard damage. As a result, Lycanroc-D benefits greatly from pivoting teammates to bring it in without taking a hit. Slow pivots, such as Magnezone and Swampert, can take the hit themselves, safely bringing Lycanroc-D in, while fast, strong pivots like Noivern can scare out opposing Pokemon to bring Lycanroc-D in for free. Special attackers such as Dragalge, Magnezone, and Thundurus appreciate Lycanroc-D's ability to blow holes in special walls like Alolan Muk, and in return they can wear down common physical walls like Slowbro and Quagsire. On hyper offense teams, particularly those using Galvantula to set up Sticky Web, Lycanroc-D's threat potential is only increased, allowing it to outspeed dangerous Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Infernape. Grass-types, primarily Rapid Spin users like Tsareena and Brambleghast, also pair well with Lycanroc-D, threatening common Ground-type checks like Swampert and Quagsire and removing the hazards that would otherwise chip away at Lycanroc-D's HP. Teammates like Slowbro and Talonflame can switch in on threatening revenge killers like Mienshao and Krookodile, and Slowbro can also help check opposing Talonflame, which threatens to cripple Lycanroc-D with Flame Body burns.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Accelerock provides priority that's useful against the few threats in the tier that outspeed Lycanroc-D, dealing super effective damage to Noivern, Talonflame, and Thundurus. It also provides an option to pick off Shell Smash sweepers like Cloyster and some weakened Choice Scarf users, such as Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion. Close Combat can OHKO specially defensive Registeel, 2HKO Avalugg, and serve as a strong neutral coverage move in response to many other threats. Tera Fighting Close Combat can also guarantee 2HKOs on Swampert and Quagsire. Crunch cleanly 2HKOes Slowbro and Reuniclus, and Psychic Fangs 2HKOes Vileplume and OHKOes all but the most physically bulky Dragalge. Sucker Punch provides Lycanroc-D with a stronger priority move than Accelerock that's not resisted by the Choice Scarf Ground-types that try to revenge kill it. Stone Edge is a stronger STAB move than Accelerock, and unlike the rest of Lycanroc-D's options, it does not risk activating contact-based abilities like Effect Spore and Flame Body. With Choice Band, Stone Edge cleanly 2HKOes Vileplume. Life Orb provides less immediate power but more flexibility at the cost of some HP, while Choice Band provides maximum immediate damage at the cost of locking Lycanroc-D into a move.</p> <p>Slow pivots like Magnezone, Swampert, and Incineroar can take a hit and cleanly switch into Lycanroc-D, getting it onto the field without taking damage. Teammates like Tsareena, Brambleghast, and Feraligatr can break through bulky Water- and Ground-types that could otherwise tank multiple hits, such as Slowbro and Swampert. Strong special attackers, such as Magnezone, Thundurus, and Porygon-Z, support Lycanroc-D by breaking through the physical walls, like Slowbro and Quagsire, that can check it. Rapid Spin users like Tsareena and Brambleghast, as well as Defog users like Talonflame, pair well with Lycanroc-D, removing entry hazards that hurt its already limited longevity. Galvantula, as the premier Sticky Web setter in the tier, also pairs well with Lycanroc-D, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Infernape that would otherwise pose a threat to it. Defensively, teammates like Slowbro and Talonflame can take Close Combat and Earthquake from potential revenge killers like Mienshao and Krookodile, and Slowbro further checks Talonflame, which potentially threatens Lycanroc-D with a Flame Body burn on every attack except Stone Edge.</p>"

While offensive Tsareena profiles as a solid wallbreaker that can take over games thanks to Rapid Spin's Speed boost, defensive sets are fantastic at checking the swathes of offensive Ground-types in NU, especially Krookodile and Flygon, and its access to Synthesis is a huge factor in it outclassing Brambleghast, its primary competition. Tsareena faces some very real struggles defensively, though, as almost every Ground-type it aims to check carries super effective coverage, like Gunk Shot from Krookodile and Megahorn from Rhyperior, that threatens to KO it with minimal chip damage required. Offensive sets aren't very fast without a Speed boost and easily pressured by other wallbreakers like Chandelure and Munkidori as well as fast utility options in Noivern and Talonflame. Meanwhile, defensive sets are quite easy to exploit due to their reliance on Knock Off with Pokemon like RestTalk Alolan Muk, Vileplume, and Dragalge.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tsareena has other usable Tera types than the ones listed, but they lack consistency across teams. Tera Dark is good for teams that lack a Ghost resistance and amps up Knock Off's damage, but it offers little else. Tera Ghost is a harder answer to Fighting-types than Tera Poison, but it's just as bad into Krookodile and gives Tsareena a horrible Alolan Muk matchup. Tera Fire is similar to Tera Dragon in helping Tsareena against Fire-types, although Tsareena gains a Water weakness. Choice Scarf sets are good at revenge killing priority-reliant setup sweepers like Lycanroc-D and Lucario and don't have to worry about Klefki's Thunder Wave.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: All of Talonflame, Noivern, and Acrobatics Thundurus outspeed Tsareena and beat it with relative ease. Talonflame hates losing its item, though, and both Noivern and Thundurus are vulnerable to Triple Axel from offensive sets.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Alolan Muk is a great Tsareena answer, especially if it's RestTalk. Other Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Munkidori are good checks but less consistent. The former two cannot survive Knock Off followed by Triple Axel, while the latter is too frail to take Knock Off from either Tsareena set.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Incineroar counters Tsareena with ease, only fearing the rare High Jump Kick. Although Knock Off obliterates Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, they both can spinblock Tsareena, tank its Power Whip, and OHKO it with their Fire-type attacks barring a well-timed Terastallization.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Tsareena doubles as a source of entry hazard removal and a potent wallbreaker. Knock Off punishes switch-ins such as Talonflame and Magnezone while obliterating Chandelure, and Triple Axel deletes opposing Grass-types like Vileplume, Venusaur, and Rotom-C as well as Noivern. If you wish to tap further into Tsareena's utility movepool, U-turn is optional over Triple Axel, still giving it an out against any of its checks while enabling its stronger teammates. High Jump Kick is another coverage move you can try, as it's Tsareena's best option for hitting Steel-type hazard setters like Copperajah and Registeel and does good damage to Incineroar. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Tsareena bypass hazard damage, which increases its proficiency as a spinner, but Lum Berry helps against Talonflame's Flame Body and Slowbro's Scald. Tsareena usually shouldn't be Terastallizing, but Tera Dragon potentially lets it KO a Chandelure or Hisuian Typhlosion with Knock Off and gives Tsareena a good sun matchup, while Tera Steel blanks Munkidori's STAB moves, potentially lets Tsareena beat Cloyster, and helps it against Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Tsareena is great at luring in and beating certain Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Venusaur with Triple Axel; make sure to pair it with teammates like Mienshao, Thundurus, and Sylveon that can take advantage of this. Furthermore, Mienshao especially, as well as other physical attackers like Gallade and Infernape, appreciate Tsareena removing Talonflame's Heavy-Duty Boots and making it easier to overwhelm with Stealth Rock up. Similarly, teammates like Choice Specs Noivern, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion all appreciate Tsareena's Rapid Spin, and the latter two can beat Steel-type checks like Klefki, Registeel, and Magnezone for Tsareena. Talonflame is perhaps the most common switch-in to Tsareena, so Pokemon like Diancie and Slowbro that easily switch into it are helpful to have.</p>"

Although they possess super effective coverage moves for it, they can't OHKO it, and Synthesis keeps Tsareena healthy throughout the game so it can stay out of KO range from these threats. The biggest boon to this set, though, is destroying Klefki; it can't do enough damage with Foul Play thanks to the bulk investment, and Power Whip or Trop Kick will slowly beat it down. Trop Kick can be used over Power Whip for its accuracy, but you lose out on useful damage rolls like 2HKOing Diancie, 2HKOing Assault Vest Reuniclus after Stealth Rock, and OHKOing Krookodile. The Speed EVs ensure Tsareena outspeeds Modest Diancie before it can attack with Meteor Beam, but Tsareena can go even faster if it wants, with relevant targets including Modest Magnezone, Torterra, and Adamant Feraligatr. Tsareena will rarely want to Terastallize, but Tera Poison is nice to consistently answer Fighting-types like Mienshao and non-Meteor Mash Lucario and makes Tsareena immune to poison from Alolan Muk at the cost of becoming weak to Earthquake; Tera Dragon aids against Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion and retains several resistances to types like Water, Grass, and Electric; and Tera Steel is useful for checking Fairy- and Poison-types such as Sylveon and Munkidori as well as Cloyster.</p> <p>Tsareena creates great defensive cores with common entry hazard setters like Diancie and Rhyperior.

In return, Mabosstiff can potentially create openings for them with Destiny Bond and check nuisances like Indeedee-F and Toxicroak.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mabosstiff is an amazing wallbreaker in NU due to its great offensive typing and coverage coupled with Stakeout. Stakeout's boost means even the most reliable Dark-resistant Pokemon like Paldean Tauros and Umbreon struggle to switch in consistently. This often forces Pokemon weak to Crunch like Bruxish, Drifblim, and Farigiraf to Terastallize or give up a KO to a Stakeout boosted attack. Play Rough takes out Dark-resistant foes like Paldean Tauros, Umbreon, and Passimian. Psychic Fangs hits Qwilfish and Fighting-types, like Passimian and Toxicroak, with an added niche of breaking screens. Retaliate is difficult to switch into after a teammate has been KOed. Facade can keep a statused Mabosstiff useable. Tera Dark boosts Crunch's damage output while Tera Fairy powers up Play Rough and grants a resistance to U-Turn and Fighting moves from Passimian. Offensive checks to Mabosstiff, like Scyther and Choice Scarf Passimian, can often gain momentum by forcing it out, so teammates with a Rocky Helmet like Sandaconda and especially Poison Point Qwilfish are helpful. Fast sweepers and late-game cleaners like Choice Scarf Passimian and Quiver Dance Vivillon appreciate Mabosstiff's wallbreaking, as they may otherwise be worn down by the opposing team.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Fillet Away in conjunction with Sharpness-boosted STAB moves turns Veluza into a terrifying sweeper capable of shredding teams with only a single turn of setup. Veluza is an excellent choice for hyper offense teams, where it acts as a deadly wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Veluza can easily find setup opportunities against passive foes, such as Vaporeon, and Choice-locked foes, such as a Passimian that just used Close Combat. Although Veluza is extremely powerful after setting up, it may not always get the chance to do so due to its frailty. Veluza's defensive typing is also relatively poor; it is weak to common attacks, including pivoting moves like U-turn from Scyther and Volt Switch from Rotom. Furthermore, Veluza's speed and firepower are rather mediocre prior to setup.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tera Ground enables Veluza to turn the tables on a Jolteon or Rotom trying to grab momentum with Volt Switch. Tera Electric is another option that lets Veluza avoid paralysis from Chansey and Sandaconda while also turning its Electric weakness into a resistance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Veluza's mediocre bulk and need to sacrifice half of its health to set up means that sufficient offensive pressure can prevent it from taking over a game.</p> <p><strong>U-turn and Volt Switch</strong>: Veluza's poor defensive typing renders it weak to both U-turn and Volt Switch, which means that foes such as Jolteon and Scyther can easily gain momentum on or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Cacturne</strong>: Cacturne is immune to Psycho Cut and Aqua Cutter, enabling it to completely wall any Veluza not running Tera Fairy Tera Blast.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fillet Away is one of the best setup moves in the game, doubling Veluza's Speed and power at the cost of half its health. Aqua Cutter and Psycho Cut are both boosted by Sharpness, and after a Fillet Away will OHKO many neutral targets, such as Rotom, Mabosstiff, and Clawitzer. For Veluza's last move, Substitute can be used to ease prediction, facilitate setup, and avoid Sucker Punch. Aqua Jet can also be used to revenge kill weakened foes and, after setup, outprioritize other priority moves such as Lycanroc's Accelerock. Tera Blast is an option with Tera Fairy to blast past Cacturne, which otherwise completely walls it. Otherwise, Tera Water is good choice to further boost the power of Veluza's Aqua Cutter, giving it a guaranteed OHKO on specially defensive Umbreon after Stealth Rock. Sitrus Berry helps Veluza set up sucessfully, and 4 HP EVs ensure that it will activate after a Fillet Away. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Veluza's damage output, but a Jolly nature enables Veluza to outspeed Timid Farigiraf prior to setup and Choice Scarf Zoroark post-setup.</p> <p>Veluza's incredible Speed and power after setup make it an excellent choice for hyper offense teams. Entry hazard support from Lycanroc and Qwilfish can help chip Veluza's checks into range of its attacks. Bulk Up Paldean Tauros is a great partner for Veluza, as it can easily switch into and set up against Pokemon that give Veluza trouble, such as Cacturne. In return, Veluza can set up on Pokemon used to revenge kill or force out Paldean Tauros, like a Choice Scarf Indeedee-F locked into Psychic or Psyshock. Paldean Tauros also helps Veluza break past shared walls in Vaporeon and Tera Water Sandaconda, enabling one of them to sweep late-game. Other good offensive partners to pair with Veluza include Jolteon and Quiver Dance Vivillon. Jolteon provides an Electric immunity for the team while also giving Veluza points of entry through Volt Switch. Vivillon threatens Cacturne, and its Sleep Powder may cripple one of Veluza's checks, allowing it to sweep. Indeedee-F is another good teammate for Veluza, as Psychic Terrain shields Veluza from priority attacks, such as Sucker Punch, while boosting the power of Psycho Cut to absurd levels.</p>"
