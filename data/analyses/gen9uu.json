Notably, it can even prevent Adamant Lokix from revenge killing Hisuian Arcanine with First Impression. The perfect coverage afforded by these moves lets it fit a utility option into its last moveslot. Hisuian Arcanine is a great Stealth Rock setter thanks to its great matchup against Excadrill and Mandibuzz, the most common entry hazard removers, but it can also use Morning Sun to let its user more recklessly switch it in against foes like Tinkaton and Zapdos. Howl can be used over either choice to boost Hisuian Arcanine's Attack, letting it more easily cleave through offense with a boosted Extreme Speed. A Jolly nature with Tera Normal is chosen to let Hisuian Arcanine get the jump on Excadrill and to give Extreme Speed a much-needed power boost against offensive teams.</p> <p>Hisuian Arcanine best fits on offensive teams and is best supported by offensive teammates that can break through the few things that can take on its STAB attacks. Latios can break through Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon, and it can help with some offensive foes that Hisuian Arcanine struggles to revenge kill like Sand Rush Excadrill while also switching into Keldeo for it. Stealth Rock setters like Tinkaton let Hisuian Arcanine more freely run Morning Sun, and in return it relieves some pressure on them to switch into Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Tinkaton can also check some foes Hisuian Arcanine struggles with, like the Normal-resistant faster offensive threats Ogerpon-C. Pivot support from allies like Lokix and Tornadus-T can bring Hisuian Arcanine in on prey like Tinkaton and Zapdos. Strong Water-types like Azumarill and Greninja can help Hisuian Arcanine with bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Rhyperior that cause it problems.</p>"

Heat Wave nails the aforementioned Excadrill, Metagross, and Tera Steel Hydrapple. Volt Switch allows it to pivot out of switch-ins like Hisuian Arcanine and Tyranitar. Zapdos can also run U-turn instead of Volt Switch to paralyze faster foes such as Latios and U-turn to freely pivot out on Ground-types like Sandy Shocks and Hippowdon, and it can run Discharge instead of Heat Wave to paralyze faster foes such as Latios. However, missing out on Heat Wave leaves it much more vulnerable to Swords Dance Excadrill and Nasty Plot Thundurus-T. 96 Speed EVs lets Zapdos outspeed Adamant Mamoswine. Zapdos can alternatively run a specially defensive EV spread and a Calm nature to better check Hydrapple. Tera Steel is preferred to take on Ogerpon-C, Latios, and Ice Beam Greninja. Tera Dragon allows it to better check to Choice Specs Keldeo and opposing Zapdos, as well as taking +6 Aqua Jet from Azumarill in a pinch.</p> <p>Zapdos is able to fit on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to great bulk, pivoting, and Static punishing faster pivots and revenge killers. Excadrill is a great partner for Zapdos, since it appreciates foes such as Tornadus-T, Lokix, Mienshao, and Hydrapple being dealt with for it to easily sweep with Swords Dance. In return, Excadrill can check Latios and remove Stealth Rock for Zapdos, as it often switches into Knock Off, allowing it to retain longevity without needing to use Roost. Rhyperior and Sandy Shocks are major roadblocks for Zapdos, since they can tank Hurricane and block Volt Switch. As such, partners like Greninja and Hydrapple can break through them. Pivots such as Slowking and Lokix can bring Zapdos in on Ogerpon, Cobalion, and Mienshao while checking Latios. Cobalion can switch into Ogerpon-C as well as Knock Off users to retain Zapdos's Heavy-Duty Boots; it can also check Excadrill for non-Heat Wave variants. Tinkaton is a useful partner, as it can wear down Rhyperior and Latios with Stealth Rock, while checking Latios and Ogerpon-C.</p>"

Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to circumvent its vulnerable Speed tier, letting it hit threats like Thundurus-T, Excadrill, and Hisuian Arcanine without getting damaged by them first. Knock Off allows Azumarill to hit Slowking reliably while also hitting hard into switch-ins to its STAB moves, such as Volcanion, Sinistcha, and Pecharunt. It also lets Azumarill cripple threats like Zapdos and Toxapex by removing their items from them. Choice Band works in tandem with Huge Power to boost Azumarill's Attack stat to absurdly high levels, while Leftovers increases Azumarill's longevity. Tera Water boosts Azumarill's STAB Liquidation and Aqua Jet to even more absurd levels, notably guaranteeing an OHKO on Tornadus-T with Liquidation. Alternatively, Tera Steel can be used to resist Grass-type moves from foes like Hydrapple and Ogerpon-C, and Tera Electric can be used to resist Electric-type moves from foes like Zapdos and Thundurus-T, with the added bonus of also resisting the former's Hurricane and preventing Azumarill from being punished by Static. The second EV spread allows Azumarill to outspeed Skeledirge while giving it more bulk to better check Pokemon like Keldeo and Greninja.</p> <p>Azumarill fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to break massive holes through teams while maintaining an aggressive, fast-paced style to offset Azumarill's low Speed and lack of defensive presence overall compared to other Water-types. Azumarill can easily be worn down by entry hazards, so Excadrill makes for a great partner to remove the hazards that plague it. Azumarill's biggest counter is Toxapex, which can only be hit by Knock Off that Toxapex shrugs off anyway, so ways to pressure it with Pokemon such as the aforementioned Excadrill, Zapdos, Latios, and Okidogi are essential. Other bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Rotom-W, and Volcanion prevent Azumarill from locking into Liquidation or Aqua Jet, so Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Zarude can help handle them. Lokix makes a great partner for Azumarill, acting as a secondary revenge killer to handle threats like Scizor and Latios that Azumarill cannot. Azumarill also struggles against Grass-types like Sinistcha and Ogerpon, so Pokemon like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Scizor are helpful teammates, though the former two struggle against Ogerpon-C. All of these Pokemon also provide useful pivot support to bring Azumarill in against many foes like Hisuian Arcanine, Rhyperior, Skeledirge, and Ursaluna to wallbreak.</p>"

It is also a dangerous wallbreaker that annihilates slower counterplay. Azumarill is vital in providing natural defensive utility against certain sets of Latios and Greninja, in addition to being a countermeasure for hyper offense teams against the sand archetype. Play Rough enables it to KO Water-resistant Pokemon such as Hydrapple and Latios as well as beefier neutral targets like Mandibuzz and Slowking. Knock Off serves as an alternative damage option to hit Toxapex and Pecharunt, 2HKO Skeledirge, and be a more reliable way of taking out Slowking. Sitrus Berry is used to give Azumarill a much-needed health boost after using Belly Drum. The alternate EV spread lets Azumarill outspeed Skeledirge. Tera Water boosts damage from Aqua Jet, enabling it to OHKO Zapdos, as well as OHKOing Greninja and Latios after Stealth Rock. Tera Electric gives Azumarill the ability to set up on Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Thundurus-T. Both Tera types give Azumarill a Steel resistance, which is useful to set up on Scizor and Metagross. Alternatively, a Jolly nature could be run to outspeed threats such as Mandibuzz, Sinistcha, Metagross, and Pecharunt, but this comes at a cost, as the drop in the power of Aqua Jet is noticeable.</p> <p>Azumarill fits best on hyper offense teams as a late-game sweeper that can take down weakened teams with +6 Aqua Jet. Excadrill and Sandy Shocks provide a key role in breaking Ogerpon-C's Sturdy with entry hazards as well as getting Cobalion, Latios, and Greninja in range of +6 Aqua Jet. Thundurus-T and Ogerpon-C can pressure faster threats such as Rotom-W, Volcanion, and Tera Water Zapdos. Greninja and Bisharp are able to check Pecharunt and Sinistcha, both of which can check Azumarill. Sticky Web from Araquanid is able to slow down threats such as Sinistcha and Pecharunt, bringing them down to a speed where Adamant Azumarill can defeat them.</p>"

Thunder Wave slows down foes such as Tornadus-T and Latios. On teams where the speed control is not needed, Future Sight is a good alternative to support its teammates with extra damage. Chilly Recpetion is key for bringing teammates in safely while pairing very well with Future Sight. It can also be used to clear sand. The first EV spread allows it to take on physical attackers like Mamoswine and +2 Excadrill, while the second EV spread lets it survive Choice Specs Tera Dragon Draco Meteor from Latios. 0 Speed IVs make Slowking as slow as possible to ensure that Chilly Reception can pivot in a teammate without taking any damage. Tera Fairy flips its weakness to Dark and Bug while gaining a Dragon immunity, letting it paralyze Greninja and Ogerpon while more safely switching into Hydrapple. Tera Water is a decent alternative that retains its Water resistance so it can still check Azumarill and Keldeo while boosting Scald’s damage, OHKOing Rhyperior and Excadrill with slight chip damage.</p> <p>Slowking fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate the speed control and consistent pivoting. Hydrapple forms a fantastic Regenerator core with Slowking, as it can easily handle Ogerpon as well as shared checks in Lokix and Latios if it Terastalizes. Slowking can also use Thunder Wave to slow down Tinkaton and opposing Hydrapple. Lokix is another excellent partner for Slowking, as it can be brought in safely by Chilly Reception to revenge kill a foe like Excadrill. It is also able to threaten Dark-types, which are immune to Future Sight, such as Tyranitar, opposing Lokix, and Mandibuzz with Knock Off. Slower wallbreakers like Flame Orb Ursaluna and Mamoswine love Slowking slowing down Cobalion, Tinkaton, and Tornadus-T for them, while in return, they can both break through Zapdos. The latter also appreciates the Defense boost from snow, letting it easily take priority moves from Lokix, Scizor, and Azumarill. Zapdos and Thundurus-T are huge nuisances to Slowking, so Sandy Shocks and Rhyperior help handle them nicely. Slowking also appreciates teammates that handle Grass-types like Hydrapple and Ogerpon. Scizor and Assault Vest Tornadus-T form a good pivot core, with the latter helping on take on Latios for physically defensive variants. Skeledirge appreciates Slowking spreading status for Hex to deal more damage as well. Tinkaton can run Thunder Wave itself, opening up Slowking to use Future Sight while checking Ogerpon-C, Lokix, and Latios. Weather Ball users like Nasty Plot Tornadus-T, Thundurus-T, and Raikou also appreciate the Ice coverage from snow, allowing them to nail Hydrapple and Ogerpon-C.</p>"

Bullet Punch in tandem with Technician allows Scizor to pressure frailer, faster threats, notably OHKOing Ogerpon-C after Stealth Rock, Mamoswine after little chip damage, and Lokix and Latios at +2. Knock Off helps Scizor cripple common switch-ins like Zapdos and Mandibuzz by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots, as well as dealing super effective damage to Skeledirge and Metagross. U-turn does big damage to Pokemon like Slowking and Hydrapple, as well as allowing Scizor to escape bad matchups from Pokemon like Cobalion and Toxapex. 136 Speed EVs are used for Scizor to outspeed Adamant Azumarill, with the rest pumped into bulk. Tera Steel is used to add extra power to its already impressive Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, notably OHKOing Heavy-Duty Boots Tornadus-T at +2 and 2HKOing Azumarill. Alternatively, Tera Fire is used to flip its matchup versus Skeledirge and Hisuian Arcanine, allowing it to safely hit the former with Knock Off and hindering its ability to consistently switch in. It can also be used to absorb Will-O-Wisp from the aforementioned Skeledirge, as well as resisting Heat Wave from Tornadus-T. However, this gives up Scizor's good defensive typing, resulting in worse matchups against tier staples like Hydrapple, Rhyperior, and Excadrill, as well as taking more entry hazard damage should Scizor's Heavy-Duty Boots get removed. Scizor can also use Tera Electric to avoid getting paralyzed by Static from Zapdos, which would otherwise punish its contact moves.</p> <p>As an offensive pivot, Scizor does best on bulky offense and offense structures, able to use the fast-paced nature of such team styles to pivot around, provide item displacement, and revenge kill key threats. Rhyperior is a phenomenal teammate due to its ability to counter dangerous threats to Scizor like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Hisuian Arcanine well as provide key Stealth Rock support to put threats like Ogerpon-C and Mamoswine into range of Bullet Punch more easily. Other entry hazard setters like Sandy Shocks and Cobalion also are good teammates, both forming a VoltTurn core to bring Scizor in against threats like Hydrapple, with Cobalion also being able to offensively check Lokix and Excadrill. Scizor also works well with the Pokemon that appreciate its free switches, such as wallbreakers like Latios, Mamoswine, and Azumarill. These wallbreakers provide the raw power needed to blast past Scizor's defensive checks and counters, like Cobalion, Toxapex, and Zapdos. Once these walls are gone, Scizor can clean up after a Swords Dance. Scizor also forms a potent core with other pivots, such as Zapdos and Slowking, with the latter able to take on the Fire-type moves thrown at it. Defensive partners include Pokemon like the aforementioned Slowking, as well as Rhyperior, Skeledirge, and Tinkaton; the latter acts as a primary check to Latios and Hydrapple so that Scizor doesn't get chipped down trying to switch into their attacks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Band, excellent STAB moves, good defensive typing, and amazing ability in Technician, Scizor proves to be a threatening pivot, wallbreaker, and revenge killer. Bullet Punch is an incredibly powerful priority move capable of picking off faster attackers like Ogerpon-C and Mienshao after Spikes chip damage, as well as 2HKOing Latios and Lokix. U-turn allows Scizor to switch out of unfavorable matchups such as Zapdos and Toxapex so that it can get a more reliable teammate in to handle them. Close Combat is an excellent coverage move for Scizor, allowing it to break offensive Steel-type Pokemon such as Excadrill, Cobalion, and Magnezone. Lastly, Knock Off is used to cripple and weaken Pokemon reliant on their items, such as Zapdos, Skeledirge, and Hippowdon, making them all easier to target. Tera Steel maximizes the power of Bullet Punch, allowing Scizor to hit even harder. Tera Electric prevents Scizor from getting paralyzed by Zapdos's Static.</p> <p>Scizor fits best on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams to make the most of its offensive capabilities. Offensive teammates like Ogerpon-C, Latios, and Zapdos are  appreciated, as  they can take on threats such as Toxapex and Keldeo for Scizor, as well as being able to dismantle the opposing team for it to begin sweeping. Defensive pivots such as Tornadus-T and Slowking work amazingly with Scizor, helping take on offensive threats it dislikes such as Greninja and Latios while keeping up momentum. Rotom-W is a great teammate, as it forms a VoltTurn core with Scizor that can handle one another's checks, with Scizor taking on the likes of Hydrapple and Ogerpon for Rotom-W, while Rotom-W removes Fire-type Pokemon that can threaten Scizor such as Skeledirge and Hisuian Arcanine. Entry hazard setters like Sandy Shocks and Cobalion help Scizor to get more value out of using Bullet Punch with the help of chip damage, while Tyranitar can set up both Stealth Rock and sand, which chip away at opposing Pokemon even quicker. Excadrill is a very important teammate for Scizor to have, as it can lure in Zapdos and remove it with a +2 Rock Slide and can take pressure off of Scizor by pivoting into Latios so it can preserve its HP.</p>"

Tyranitar's ability to remove items with a strong Knock Off and pressure entry hazard removers like Mandibuzz and Excadrill from switching in safely make it an effective Stealth Rock setter. Thunder Wave allows Tyranitar to punish switch-ins like Keldeo, Tinkaton, and Cobalion. It can also be used to cripple Tera Steel Latios to help other teammates deal with them better. Earthquake can be used to do heavy damage to Tinkaton, Excadrill, and Cobalion, but without Attack investment, it does not threaten much else. Ice Punch is an option if Tyranitar is paired with Excadrill to lure in and remove a weakened Hydrapple to help it sweep more easily. Leftovers is the preferred item choice to provide Tyranitar with passive recovery. Smooth Rock can be used to provide Sand Rush Excadrill with more sand turns but is far from necessary. Heavy-Duty Boots can help offset entry hazard damage. Chople Berry is a situational item that allows Tyranitar to check Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Aura Sphere Latios. The given Speed EVs allow Tyranitar to outpace Skeledirge and hit it hard before potentially being punished by Will-O-Wisp. Tera Fairy removes Tyranitar's glaring weaknesses, particularly to Fighting, allowing it to punish Pokemon like Mienshao. It also allows Tyranitar to deal with a boosted Draco Meteor from Latios and KO it back while improving its matchup against Lokix. Tera Ghost can be used for a similar reason to remove Tyranitar's weaknesses while also potentially preventing Excadrill from being able to remove its Stealth Rock. Tera Water is another option to improve the matchup into Greninja and Choice-locked Keldeo; however, under sand, Tyranitar can take a boosted Surf from them anyway. Tera on Tyranitar should be used in emergencies, as removing its Rock typing takes away the boost to its Special Defense under sand and causes it to take damage from sand as well.</p> <p>Tyranitar fits best on offensive structures that can force progress, as it is susceptible to being worn down quickly. Excadrill is a great partner that can remove entry hazards for Tyranitar, as well as capitalize on the sand with Sand Rush to turn it into a deadly cleaner. Tinkaton pairs nicely with Tyranitar to act as a secondary check to Latios and Tornadus-T, as both are capable of chipping away at Tyranitar or potentially KOing it with Fighting-type coverage. Tinkaton also helps against other threatening wallbreakers like Ogerpon formes and Lokix; pickpocket Tinkaton variants are able to steal their Heavy-Duty Boots, causing them to slowly get whittled down by Tyranitar's Stealth Rock and sand. Other U-turn punishers like Rocky Helmet Cobalion and Zapdos can also support Tyranitar well. Slowking and Tornadus-T can help deal with Cobalion and Keldeo. Tornadus-T can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Zapdos, allowing Tyranitar to get meaningful damage on it with Stealth Rock throughout a battle. Toxapex and Hydrapple do not mind having their item removed thanks to Regenerator, so partners like Zapdos and Mamoswine can help threaten them.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Tyranitar is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the tier, with its massive Attack stat, strong spammable STAB combination that hits key threats such as Latios, Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Slowking, and coverage moves to hit its counterplay. It can also leverage its great natural bulk, especially when combined with its Special Defense boost from sand, to defensively answer special attackers like Zapdos and Latios. Earthquake pairs with Stone Edge very well for near-perfect coverage, hitting many Steel-types that would otherwise take Tyranitar's moves solidly, including Tinkaton and Cobalion. Ice Punch is solely used to OHKO Hydrapple. Tera Dark can boost the sheer strength of Tyranitar's Knock Off, 2HKOing itemless Toxapex and doing greater damage to walls like Hippowdon and Rhyperior. It also lets it avoid super effective hits, such as Greninja's Surf and Hydro Pump and Excadrill's STAB moves, and KO back. However, it leaves it vulnerable to its own sand chip and voids the Special Defense boost from sand. Tera Rock can similarly boost the power of its Stone Edge, letting it 2HKO maximum Defense Hydrapple, which is otherwise its most common switch-in. This also allows it to keep the sand Special Defense boost and avoid the chip damage so it can take on the attacks of Latios and Zapdos more easily. Tera Flying can be used to obtain a resistance and immunity to Fighting- and Ground-type moves, respectively, from offensive checks such as Excadrill, Cobalion, and Mienshao, but gaining a weakness to Stealth Rock can be costly.</p> <p>Tyranitar often appreciates slow pivots to help it enter safely, as it does not have any form of recovery and thus does not like taking many attacks. Slowking does so and offers Future Sight support to help Tyranitar break through some of its checks, such as Okidogi and Toxapex, more easily. It can also help defensively check foes like Cobalion and Keldeo and offers paralysis to let Tyranitar outspeed foes such as Tornadus-T and Latios. Another good partner for Tyranitar is Excadrill, which, even with the limited sand turns, can revenge kill fast threats that may threaten out Tyranitar with OHKOs, such as Keldeo and Cobalion. Excadrill also helps wear down their shared checks in Rhyperior and Hydrapple, and Rapid Spin can allow Tyranitar to live longer and break more due to it no longer taking entry hazard chip damage. Hazard setters can provide support to chip defensive Pokemon like Hydrapple, Hippowdon, and Rhyperior into KO range from Tyranitar's attacks, while Tyranitar can remove the Heavy-Duty Boots that these Pokemon use to avoid hazard damage. Cobalion also helps defensively check revenge killers to Tyranitar like Lokix and both Ogerpon formes while providing the ability to pivot on foes, namely Slowking. Sandy Shocks can offensively check potential Tyranitar switch-ins or revenge killers like Okidogi and Tinkaton and can act as an alternative Zapdos check while blocking Volt Switch. Zapdos can check Tornadus-T, pivot Tyranitar in, and check Ogerpon and Lokix that check Tyranitar. Static paralysis can allow Tyranitar to outspeed would-be faster threats and deal great damage. Tornadus-T can be a great partner for Tyranitar, checking many threats that it may let in and forcing switches of its own, which can let it bring in Tyranitar to wreak havoc. Its Flying typing and solid special bulk with Regenerator can allow it to check Cobalion and Greninja while assisting Tyranitar with checking Latios. Ogerpon and Hydrapple can work well alongside Tyranitar, checking Water-type threats such as Greninja and Azumarill that Tyranitar lets in. Scizor and Lokix can help revenge kill or pressure strong threats to Tyranitar such as Ogerpon, Greninja, Tinkaton, and Hydrapple. They can also remove potential Air Balloons from Tinkaton and Cobalion to make them vulnerable to Tyranitar's Earthquake.</p>"

Stealth Rock also allows Metagross to function as an entry hazard setter, while Bullet Punch gives Metagross a STAB priority move to circumvent its below average Speed, hitting foes like Ogerpon-C and Mamoswine. Knock Off can be used to cripple checks like Slowking and Zapdos by removing their items, while Earthquake can be used to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill and Cobalion. Leftovers is crucial for maintaining Metagross's longevity, since it doesn't get a recovery move. 96 Speed EVs allow Metagross to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Azumarill. Tera Dark allows Metagross to turn its weaknesses to Dark and Ghost into resistances while also boosting the power of its Knock Off, while Tera Water allows it to resist Fire-type attacks from Hisuian Arcanine and Skeledirge and tank Belly Drum Azumarill's boosted Aqua Jet.</p> <p>Metagross does best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its good mix of power and bulk. Teammates like Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Hydrapple all provide a Ground resistance that covers Metagross's weakness. In return, Metagross answers Ogerpon-C, which is scary for the former two and takes pressure off of Hydrapple. However, it is important to note that Zapdos and Tornadus-T cannot switch into Rhyperior safely, so answers to it like Slowking or the aforementioned Hydrapple are appreciated. Metagross is also weak to Fire-type moves from Pokemon like Hisuian Arcanine and Skeledirge, so Water types like Rotom-W and Slowking can help tank these attacks, both of which can use pivot moves to bring Metagross in safely. In general, Metagross benefits greatly from pivots that can bring it in safely, so U-turn users like Lokix, Tornadus-T, and Scizor also make great teammates. Metagross tends to struggle with bulky Flying-types like Zapdos and Mandibuzz, so it benefits from teammates that can handle these two, such as Rhyperior and Sandy Shocks. These two Pokemon also act as alternate Stealth Rock users, which not only synergizes well with Metagross's Knock Off but also allows it to run Bullet Punch. The latter can also act as a spiker to form a hazard-stacking core with Metagross.</p>"

      "METABOOM": {
        "description": "<p>Explosion Metagross is an offensive Pokemon with some defensive utility and a simple gameplan: set Stealth Rock then use Explosion. Explosion does a lot of damage to the tier's defensive Pokemon like Hydrapple and Slowking. Earthquake lets it hit the Steel-types that resist its Explosion and Heavy Slam, like Empoleon and Excadrill. Stealth Rock gives it excellent utility, setting entry hazards while the foe switches out. Bullet Punch is useful when running an alternative hazard setter, as it can clean up foes at low HP. Metagross can utilize its fantastic typing to defensively check Pokemon like Latios and Hydrapple. Custap Berry alleviates how low Metagross may get in the process by gaining priority on Explosion. Normal Gem can allow it to KO some important targets, such as maximum Defense Hydrapple after Tera Normal.   The given Speed investment allows Metagross to outspeed Mandibuzz, Azumarill, and Ursaluna, but 196 Speed EVs can allow it to outspeed targets like Tinkaton and Choice Band Tyranitar; however, doing so would sacrifice some of the bulk that lets it check Ogerpon-C and Latios. Tera Normal lets Metagross power up its Explosion, letting it OHKO Zapdos and favours it to KO Hydrapple with chip, but beware that most of its defensive utility comes from its typing, so only use Tera if Metagross needs Tera Normal to KO the foe.</p> <p>Metagross fits best on offensive structures, as it lures in Zapdos and Hydrapple and weakens them for the rest of the team to exploit. Excadrill is an amazing partner, especially considering how much it threatens Skeledirge and Rotom-W, Pokemon that Metagross hates. Thundurus and Sandy Shocks also are good partners, as they enjoy Metagross's ability to switch into Latios and weaken Hydrapple. Sandy Shocks can also act as an alternate Stealth Rock setter. Metagross also enjoys Sticky Web support from Araquanid, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Tyranitar and Tinkaton while keeping its bulk as well as offensive checks like non-Heavy-Duty Boots Mamoswine and most Okidogi sets. Okidogi is another good partner, as it is great at keeping Lokix in check and uses it as a setup opportunity. Ghost-type Pokemon like Sinistcha and Pecharunt can cause problems, as they block Metagross's Explosion attempts while threatening it with Shadow Ball, so it appreciates offensive Dark-types like Tyranitar and Lokix.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its high Speed and Special Attack, Choice Specs Latios is a very deadly wallbreaker in UU, able to even break past checks such as Metagross, Slowking, and Tyranitar over time with its nuclear Draco Meteor. Thunderbolt is key coverage to nail Slowking, Tornadus-T, and Mandibuzz super effectively while doing good neutral damage to checks like Tinkaton and Scizor. Flip Turn allows Latios to preserve momentum off of checks like Empoleon and Tinkaton coming in. Trick hinders Pokemon like Slowking and Tyranitar with a useless item for them but should only be used when Latios's Choice Specs is no longer needed, is not useful in the current matchup, or is more valuable to weaken said checks to open up another teammate to win. Latios can run other coverage moves too; Shadow Ball hits Metagross super effectively while retaining coverage for Slowking, while Aura Sphere slams Excadrill and Tyranitar and gets some neutral damage off on Tinkaton and Metagross as well, but both generally are difficult moves to lock into compared to more standard options. Tera Dragon boosts Latios's Draco Meteor to absurd levels, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock and Slowking after very little chip damage as well as 2HKO specially defensive walls like Tyranitar. Tera Steel is an alternative that gives Latios greater defensive utility, being able to avoid revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Greninja, Lokix, Mamoswine, and opposing Latios.</p> <p>Choice Specs Latios is a powerful asset on bulky offense and balance builds for its powerful wallbreaking capabilities. Physical attackers such as Scizor, Okidogi, Excadrill, and Cobalion excel at pressuring checks to Latios such as Metagross, Slowking, Tinkaton, and Tyranitar. Choice Scarf Okidogi also can revenge kill Greninja and swap into Lokix, while Excadrill provides entry hazard removal to keep Stealth Rock from wearing down Latios and switches into Tinkaton reliably. Tornadus-T and Lokix act as pivots that can wear down shared checks like Tyranitar and Tinkaton and enable Latios to wallbreak by bringing it in on other foes like Zapdos and Toxapex. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Tinkaton, Rhyperior, and Sandy Shocks does a great job at wearing down Metagross and Tyranitar into range of Latios's attacks; the latter two also check Zapdos due to the lower longevity Choice Specs Latios has. Defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, Slowking, and the aforementioned Tornadus-T can defensively solidify Latios's team due to its need to predict correctly or otherwise risk losing momentum, with the latter two being additional checks to threats like Keldeo. Zapdos and Slowking also provide paralysis support to mess with revenge killers like Lokix, Tornadus-T, and Greninja.</p>"

      "Calm Mind + Tera Electric": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Terastallization, Latios utilizes Calm Mind in tandem with a STAB Thunderbolt to become an extremely powerful sweeper that plays a defining role in UU. Latios's natural bulk and high Speed allow it to gain setup chances with Calm Mind to snowball against common Pokemon like Zapdos and Rotom-W as well as others like Greninja and Tornadus-T post Tera, working in tandem with Draco Meteor to offset the Special Attack drops. Dragon Pulse is a weaker alternative that offers the benefit of not dropping Latios's Special Attack. Thunderbolt complements Latios's Dragon-type STAB attack to be an unwallable combination outside of Excadrill, targeting many Pokemon such as Azumarill, Toxapex, Tinkaton, and Metagross. Recover allows Latios to maintain longevity throughout the game and gain multiple chances to sweep while simultaneously providing natural defensive utility to its team against foes like Zapdos, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T. The passive recovery of Leftovers allows Latios to set up more easily without relying on Recover, but Ability Shield is an alternative to bypass Excadrill's Mold Breaker, allowing Latios to now set up on its biggest counter. However, this item relies on surprise factor and is vulnerable to being removed via Knock Off from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Metagross. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Latios to be a fast, hard-hitting natural threat that doesn't need to rely on boosts to be effective. Alternatively, 96 Speed EVs to outspeed Hisuian Arcanine, maximum HP investment, and the remaining EVs in Defense let Latios act as a bulkier sweeper to better stand up to foes like Metagross and Lokix at the cost of immediate power. Tera Electric is the driving point of this set, boosting Thunderbolt to powerful levels to get past foes like Tinkaton and Metagross more easily while also making it safer into Lokix and Tornadus-T, not to mention giving Latios no weaknesses thanks to its synergy with Levitate. Latios also gains an immunity to Thunder Wave from foes like Slowking and Tinkaton.</p> <p>Calm Mind + Tera Electric Latios fits on a multitude of archetypes ranging from offense to semi-stall, but it finds itself most at home on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its role as a reliable sweeper. Latios's biggest obstacle is Mold Breaker Excadrill, which handles its otherwise unresisted move combination, so Slowking and Hydrapple are great teammates to keep Excadrill in line. Slowking also provides slow pivoting support with Chilly Reception to get Latios in safely as well as provide speed control with Thunder Wave or amplify wallbreaking with Future Sight. Pivots like Zapdos and Lokix can bring Latios in to set up for a sweep while wearing down shared checks like Tyranitar and Tinkaton. Zapdos checks dangerous threats to Latios like Lokix, Tornadus-T, and Ogerpon. Meanwhile, Lokix exerts offensive pressure on the likes of Excadrill and Greninja for Latios. Stealth Rock support from Tinkaton and Rhyperior wears down foes like Toxapex and Assault Vest Tornadus-T into range of being KOed more easily. Tinkaton can also wear down Excadrill and Tera Fairy Hydrapple, while Rhyperior can pressure foes like Slowking and Mandibuzz. Skeledirge is another issue for this set, so Pokemon that handle it such as Excadrill, Ogerpon-C, and Mamoswine make great teammates. Latios is quite Tera reliant to function at its very best, so offensive threats that do not use Terastallization often like the aforementioned Excadrill and Mamoswine as well as others like Azumarill and Choice Scarf Okidogi form great offensive cores that can take out checks to Latios such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Tinkaton.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Soul Dew amplifying the power of its STAB moves, key defensive utility, and longevity, Latios is a formidable wallbreaker that can use its serviceable defensive utility in tandem with Recover to be an offensive threat that has longevity and key traits to bring to a team. Thunderbolt is key coverage to nail Slowking, Empoleon, Tornadus-T, and Mandibuzz super effectively while doing good neutral damage to checks like Tinkaton and Scizor. Flip Turn allows Latios to gain momentum against and wear down threats like Excadrill, Slowking, and Tyranitar. Recover lets Latios pivot into the likes of Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Cobalion, and Zapdos while not having to worry about being worn down, as well as offsetting recoil damage from Life Orb. Soul Dew amplifies Latios's STAB moves while keeping its move flexibility, but Life Orb is an option to give extra power to Latios's coverage moves as well at the cost of wearing it down more easily. Tera Steel lets Latios avoid getting revenge killed by Pokemon like Greninja, Mamoswine, and Lokix. It also lets Latios act as a reliable switch-in against Hydrapple and Rhyperior as well as giving it a Poison immunity, although it can no longer switch into Cobalion and Zapdos after Tera Steel.</p> <p>Latios largely fits on offense and bulky offense teams as a useful wallbreaker that provides much-needed defensive utility against foes like Zapdos and Cobalion. Pivots like Lokix and Zapdos can bring Latios in safely to wallbreak while helping it overwhelm shared checks such as Tinkaton and Tyranitar. Zapdos also checks Pokemon that threaten Latios such as Lokix and Excadrill, while Lokix revenge kills faster threats like Greninja and Choice Scarf Zarude. Tornadus-T can also bring Latios in safely while being a good source of defensive utility against the likes of Greninja and can wear down Pokemon like Slowking and Metagross for it. Tinkaton and Rhyperior can provide Stealth Rock support to put threats like Slowking and Assault Vest Tornadus-T in range of KOs more easily. Sandy Shocks can set up Spikes, help wear down Tornadus-T, and bring Latios in against Hydrapple. Araquanid is a good enabler for Latios on Sticky Web teams, slowing down faster threats like Greninja, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Choice Scarf Okidogi as well as helping it avoid a Speed tie with Ogerpon-C.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Latios becomes one of the fastest revenge killers in the tier, taking out the likes of Ogerpon-C, Greninja, opposing Latios, and +1 Quaquaval as well as outpacing other Choice Scarf users like Hoopa-U and Okidogi. Flip Turn lets Latios retain momentum as a revenge killer, especially because its lower power means it can end up as a momentum sink if it locks into the wrong STAB move, not to mention it slightly chips switch-ins like Tinkaton and Excadrill for another teammate. Trick ruins defensive switch-ins like Slowking and Tyranitar but should only be used when Latios's Choice Scarf isn’t needed. Thanks to Latios's ability to still be useful with its STAB moves + Flip Turn, it can still use Trick more liberally than other Choice item users. Tera Dragon is best to get a power boost on Latios's Draco Meteor, being able to KO Assault Vest Tornadus-T in two turns after Stealth Rock as well as guaranteeing an OHKO on Ogerpon-C after Stealth Rock with a singular Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Latios best fits on offensive builds that appreciate its lightning-fast revenge killing capabilities. Physical attackers like Rhyperior and Excadrill are able to pressure Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross for Latios; the former provides Stealth Rock support and a Zapdos switch-in while the latter offers entry hazard removal to keep Latios from being worn down by Stealth Rock, and in return, they enjoy Latios's ability to revenge kill Ogerpon-C, Cobalion, and Greninja. Zapdos, Slowking, and Cobalion can swap into attacks from Pokemon that take advantage of Latios being locked into an attack such as Metagross and Tyranitar. Zapdos, Slowking, and the aforementioned Rhyperior also check Assault Vest Tornadus-T for Latios. Lokix helps act as a secondary revenge killer against threats that don’t fear Latios like Scizor and Excadrill while wearing down Tinkaton and Tornadus-T. Lokix, alongside the aforementioned Slowking and Zapdos, also form pivoting cores with Choice Scarf Latios. Wallbreakers like Hisuian Arcanine and Greninja enjoy Latios's ability to give its Choice Scarf to Slowking and Tinkaton with Trick, in turn pressuring checks like Tyranitar and Metagross.</p>"

Its superb bulk enables it to check some of the metagame’s most dangerous threats in Pawmot, Salamence, Tyranitar, and Sandy Shocks. It also provides value through Sand Stream to help combat rain teams if given momentum to get in freely, as it can't hard switch into Water-types. Stone Edge enables Hippowdon to pressure Flying-types like Iron Jugulis and Salamence, in addition to being able to beat Taunt Dragon Dance Tyranitar even after it Terastallizes. Roar is also an option, as it allows Hippowdon to phaze setup sweepers like Polteageist in a pinch and synergizes well with entry hazards. Leftovers is the preferred item, as its residual healing improves Hippowdon's overall longevity and preserves Slack Off's PP. The given spread with an Impish nature and Leftovers avoids a 2HKO from Life Orb Pawmot and prevents Hippowdon from being KOed by Hurricane into Draco Meteor from Salamence after Stealth Rock while avoiding a 2HKO from Sandy Shocks without Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet is also an option to punish physical attackers, primarily U-turn users and Maushold. A specially defensive spread is an option to handle Gengar if Pawmot is less of a concern. Tera Rock pairs well with its sand, as the Special Defense boost it receives gives it a strong matchup versus special attackers like Gengar, Salamence, and Noivern. Additionally, Tera Rock boosts Hippowdon’s Stone Edge to put more pressure on targets like Salamence. After Hippowdon has Terastallized, it is threatened by Pawmot, Sandy Shocks, and Tyranitar, so be careful when Terastallizing. Tera Ghost is an option that makes Hippowdon a strong response versus Slither Wing, Lucario, and Maushold and lets it spinblock against Donphan. Tera Fairy is an option that grants Hippowdon a generally good defensive typing, including a Fighting resistance, and makes it less vulnerable to Greninja. After becoming a Fairy- or a Ghost-type, Hippowdon is unable to check Gengar, and in the case of the latter, Tyranitar sets running Crunch as well. Tera Dragon makes Hippowdon an effective answer to rain teams through the useful Water-type resistance it provides.</p> <p>Hippowdon most commonly fits on bulky offense or balance teams for its walling capabilities. Talonflame and Noivern make for good partners, as they are capable of grabbing momentum with U-turn off of opposing Decidueye and Wo-Chien swapping in to exploit Hippowdon. Hippowdon can in return easily absorb Knock Off from the likes of Tinkaton in order to preserve the Heavy-Duty Boots they both depend on. Wo-Chien is also a solid pick for a partner as a nice fit on most balance teams, as well as an answer to bulky Water-types that may attempt to annoy Hippowdon. In particular, Wo-Chien’s RestTalk set is capable of swapping in on Quagsire easily, as it is able to shrug off Toxic. Wo-Chien can also relieve pressure from Hippowdon, as it can take on Sandy Shocks. Tinkaton also makes for a good partner, as it is able to take a lot of the pressure off of Hippowdon by taking hits from Gengar and specially offensive Flying-types such as Iron Jugulis, Noivern, and Salamence. Tinkaton is also capable of providing useful Knock Off support by removing opposing Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots to enable Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage to stick. In return, Hippowdon being able to carry Stealth Rock means that Tinkaton does not need to run it itself and can fit a more useful option. Assault Vest Cyclizar is able to check Greninja and Wo-Chien for Hippowdon and keep Spikes or Toxic Spikes off the field from the former.</p>"

Hydro Pump gives Rotom-W an excellent STAB option and makes the life of Ground-types wishing to block Volt Switch such as Rhyperior and Excadrill hard. Volt Switch lets Rotom-W generate momentum on Pokemon that would easily take a Hydro Pump such as Azumarill, Tornadus-T, and Slowking. Will-O-Wisp helps Rotom-W cripple physically offensive threats that dislike being burnt such as Ogerpon and Excadrill while slowly chipping down any burnt Pokemon. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, punishes Tornadus-T and Latios by slowing them down while helping teammates take advantage of the Speed cut as well as the chance of paralysis. Pain Split in tandem with Rotom-W's naturally low HP stat allows it to recover a significant amount of health on foes like Hydrapple and Slowking, keeping itself healthy throughout the game. Leftovers is used to increase Rotom-W's longevity over the course of the match, letting it passively recover its health. Rotom-W is able to run two distinct EV spreads, both of which maximize its HP while allowing it to outspeed Adamant Scizor and Tyranitar. Investment into Rotom-W's Defense with a Bold nature lets it handle Sand Rush Excadrill and Metagross while living a Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine Head Smash. Rotom-W with a Calm nature and EVs in Special Defense make it a solid check to Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos. Tera Steel combined with Levitate removes the Ground weakness it would otherwise gain while gifting Rotom-W a spectacular defensive typing, letting it check Ogerpon-C and Latios better.</p> <p>Rotom-W's traits fit best on bulky offense teams that love its ability to cripple opposing Pokemon while pivoting on and off the field. Wallbreakers such as Ogerpon-C and Metagross fit excellently with it, being able to take advantage of Latios, Hydrapple, and Zapdos, which may want to switch into Rotom-W to block its shenanigans, with Metagross also functioning as a solid Latios check. Other pivots that synergize well with Rotom-W such as Lokix, Scizor, and Tornadus-T are excellent teammates, with Lokix and Scizor forming a strong VoltTurn core while handling Ogerpon, Hydrapple, and Latios for Rotom-W, while Assault Vest Tornadus-T can pivot into Latios and Keldeo for it. Ogerpon specifically both functions as a pivot and a way of punishing setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence and Calm Mind Latios with Encore thanks to Rotom-W's Volt Switch giving it free entry. Entry hazard setters like Tinkaton and Cobalion are fantastic partners for Rotom-W that support it with their strong defensive profiles. Hydrapple is an great check to Excadrill as well as the Ogerpon formes that appreciates Rotom-W's ability to handle Flying- and Ice-type types like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Mamoswine. Hisuian Arcanine functions excellently with Rotom-W, being able to maximize its offensive potential thanks to Rotom-W baiting in the likes of Hydrapple and Tinkaton for it, with Will-O-Wisp chipping down opposing checks like Mamoswine and Thunder Wave allowing Hisuian Arcanine to outspeed Pokemon like Latios and Keldeo.</p>"

Rock Slide is preferred over Iron Head to let Excadrill more easily beat Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Tornadus-T; however, Iron Head allows Excadrill to break past Hydrapple and Sinistcha. Rapid Spin is used both for its ability to remove entry hazards and also the crucial Speed boost it gives that lets Excadrill outrun the unboosted metagame. Tera Dragon lets Excadrill flip weaknesses to common moves used to check it like Greninja's Surf, Azumarill's Aqua Jet, and Hisuian Arcanine's Flare Blitz, while Tera Ground gives it a strong power boost on Earthquake, letting it OHKO Slowking at +2; this also sheds its weakness to opposing Excadrill's Earthquake. Tera Electric is useful on Iron Head sets to let Excadrill beat Zapdos despite lacking coverage to hit it. These are the main choices, but Excadrill can viably run a lot of Tera types; Tera Fire lets it set up on Skeledirge, Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost give it a resistance or immunity to moves like Mienshao's Close Combat while Tera Fairy also lets it resist Mandibuzz's Foul Play, Tera Flying lets it beat opposing Excadrill more consistently, and Tera Water helps with Greninja while retaining a stronger Scizor and Mamoswine matchup. Leftovers lets Excadrill play more flexibly mid-game before it goes for a sweep, but Air Balloon lets Excadrill beat opposing Excadrill and act as a more reliable hazard remover against Spikes teams, particularly those using Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Excadrill fits on just about any team you can think of thanks to its remarkable offensive capabilities and utility. Hydrapple is a huge roadblock for Excadrill, so Pokemon like Lokix, Tornadus-T, and Enamorus-T make for wonderful partners capable of pressuring it. Excadrill in return is great at supporting these Pokemon if they forgo Heavy-Duty Boots to alleviate their weakness to Stealth Rock by removing them from the field with Rapid Spin. It appreciates support from entry hazard setters like Tinkaton and Hisuian Arcanine; with the help of Knock Off users like the aforementioned Tornadus-T and Lokix, Excadrill can much more easily cleave through checks like Zapdos and Slowking. Tinkaton and Assault Vest Tornadus-T are also great pivots into Latios, which is appreciated by Excadrill because it doesn't take Draco Meteor well without bulk investment. Slowking makes for an effective partner, as it can check Latios, which Excadrill can often struggle with despite its type advantage. Excadrill has few defensive checks, but teammates like Scizor and Mamoswine that can threaten or weaken checks like Hydrapple and Zapdos are extremely appreciated. Excadrill can be revenge killed by foes like Greninja, Azumarill, and Lokix, so checks like Keldeo, Zapdos, and Rotom-W make for helpful teammates.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Sand Rush Excadrill is a deadly threat, being a great sweeper, wallbreaker, and revenge killer thanks to the combination of Swords Dance and it outpacing the entire boosted metagame under sand. After a Swords Dance, Rock Slide does heavy damage to Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Tornadus-T. Rapid Spin is primarily used for the utility it brings with removing entry hazards; however, its Speed boost can potentially prevent Excadrill from being revenge killed once sand has subsided. Iron Head can be used over Rapid Spin if the team is not pressured by hazards as much, which can help it break past Hydrapple and Latios more easily. Iron Head can also be used over Rock Slide, but it should be paired with Tera Electric so Excadrill can get past Zapdos. Air Balloon provides some utility against Sandy Shocks, Rhyperior, and opposing Excadrill, but Leftovers can be used for passive recovery. Life Orb can be considered, as it notably allows Excadrill to OHKO Zapdos and Slowking after a Swords Dance boost, though it will cut into Excadrill's longevity and potentially bring it into range of priority from Lokix and Keldeo. A Jolly nature is primarily used so Excadrill can Speed tie with opposing Excadrill outside of sand. It also lets Excadrill outpace Battle Bond-activated Greninja under sand; however, it would be reliant on a defensive Tera to take Water Shuriken. An Adamant nature can be used to help improve the chances of KOing Pokemon like Slowking after a Swords Dance. Tera Rock increases the damage of Rock Slide to KO Mandibuzz and Zapdos, and the Special Defense boost under sand can help it beat foes like Hydrapple and take priority from Keldeo and Greninja better. Tera Dragon provides many useful resistances, notably letting it take priority hits from Greninja and Azumarill. Tera Ground provides a boost to Earthquake, allowing Excadrill to OHKO Slowking at +2 and remove its weakness to opposing Excadrill's Earthquake. Other Tera options are also great on Excadrill such as Fairy to beat Mandibuzz reliably, Fire to have a better matchup against Skeledirge, and Ghost to wall Ursaluna in conjunction with Air Balloon.</p> <p>Excadrill fits best on offensive teams that can break down defensive structures to help Excadrill sweep more easily. Sand is essential, so Tyranitar or Hippowdon are mandatory partners, both being able to set Stealth Rock to help potentially bring foes into KO range. Tyranitar can help check and pressure Mandibuzz and Zapdos for Excadrill as well as force damage on other common answers like Keldeo. Alternatively, Hippowdon offers a sturdy check to opposing Excadrill and can afford to run Smooth Rock more easily due to having reliable recovery in Slack Off. Lokix can revenge kill Excadrill with minor chip damage, so a partner like Zapdos or Cobalion can keep it in check; the latter can run Stealth Rock to allow Excadrill's partner Tyranitar to run a more offensive set. Azumarill is easily one of the deadliest threats to sand teams, so Pokemon like Volcanion, Rotom-W, and the aforementioned Zapdos are excellent teammates, all also having favorable matchups into rain teams. Rotom-W is a huge roadblock for Excadrill, so it is essential to run partners that can overwhelm it like Latios and Keldeo. Keldeo in particular can force in Excadrill answers like Latios, Hydrapple, and Sinistcha and heavily dent, or in Hydrapple's case OHKO, them with Icy Wind. Hydrapple is another partner that can pressure Rotom-W but also deals with other Pokemon like Slowking, Ogerpon, and Zarude for Excadrill. Mandibuzz can help pivot into Ogerpon and opposing Excadrill as well as provide Defog support, freeing up Excadrill to run Iron Head over Rapid Spin.</p>"

Excadrill compresses Stealth Rock as a lead and can get it up by forcing out Pokemon such as Metagross, Rotom-W, and Tyranitar. Rock Tomb can slow down Pokemon attempting to set up against Excadrill like Zarude and Thundurus-T as well as general offensive leads like Tornadus-T and Ogerpon. Steel Beam is an alternative so Excadrill can KO itself to deny Mandibuzz and opposing Excadrill from removing its entry hazards, but Excadrill still offers some useful traits like checking Latios and Comfey that make it worth not KOing itself. Focus Sash guarantees that Excadrill can get off at least one attack, often choosing to use Rapid Spin into Stealth Rock into attacking. While Excadrill should not be Terastallized under most common circumstances, as the mechanic is better utilized by a sweeper on the hyper offense team, Tera Ghost can be used in an emergency to block Rapid Spin from opposing Excadrill to guarantee Stealth Rock remains up.</p> <p>Lead Excadrill is exclusively relegated to hyper offense teams as a lead that enables many sweepers to perform effectively. Quaquaval and Ogerpon-C are two of the best sweepers of the archetype, the latter benefitting from Excadrill keeping off Stealth Rock, and they are able to take advantage of threats Excadrill gives entry to such as Keldeo, Slowking, and Zapdos. Mimikyu can block Rapid Spin from opposing Excadrill, allowing Tera to be preserved, and utilizes the entry hazards to take out foes like Tinkaton more easily while providing very valuable defensive utility against Lokix, Latios, and Greninja. Greninja appreciates entry hazard chip damage wearing down Tornadus-T and can offensively check foes like Slowking, Cobalion, and Hydrapple. Threatening sweepers like Comfey and Okidogi are able to set up on and pressure Mandibuzz and Lokix, not to mention they can use Tera themselves to now take out other threats like Metagross and Tinkaton for the former and Zapdos and Excadrill for the latter. Bisharp similarly can punish Mandibuzz attempting to use Defog with Defiant and take advantage of Stealth Rock chip damage to clean with Sucker Punch, while Azumarill takes advantage of Pokemon that lead Excadrill invites in such as Hydrapple, Quaquaval, and Hippowdon while liking hazards up to break Ogerpon-C's Sturdy.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mandibuzz has a solid niche in the UU metagame thanks to a unique and solid defensive typing, great mixed walling capabilities, and access to rare utility options like Defog and Toxic that make it a valuable addition to bulkier builds. Foul Play lets it threaten out Pokemon like Metagross, Excadrill, Scizor, and Belly Drum Azumarill. Defog lets Mandibuzz remove entry hazards for its teammates, especially against threats like Metagross and Rhyperior, although the latter might require more precise positioning than the former; it must be hit with Toxic first to be worn down, allowing Mandibuzz to utilize its natural bulk to tank Stone Edge, freely use Defog, and then use Roost to heal off the damage while not being trapped in a healing cycle due to the inability to progress against Rhyperior. Roost keeps it healthy throughout a match, allowing it to repeatedly come in and check Latios, Excadrill, Ogerpon, and Scizor. Toxic alleviates Mandibuzz's passivity a bit, threatening opposing bulky Pokemon like Slowking and Zapdos and setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Hydrapple and Calm Mind Tera Electric Latios. U-turn is an alternative to either Defog or Toxic that allows it to act as a slow pivot to maintain momentum against counters like Cobalion and Tinkaton, but Mandibuzz does not usually fit on the offensive structures that necessitate the need of U-turn to keep it from being a momentum sink. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps away the pesky damage from entry hazards. The given Speed investment allows Mandibuzz to outspeed Azumarill, while the Special Defense investment allows it to survive two Soul Dew-boosted Draco Meteors from Latios. Tera Steel helps Mandibuzz better answer foes like Latios and Greninja while flipping the script against foes like Ogerpon-C and shielding it from opposing Toxic. Tera Fairy lets it counter Dragon-types like Latios much more reliably, especially if it chooses to carry Toxic, and allows Mandibuzz to now gain a Fighting resistance while keeping its Ground neutrality against Excadrill.</p> <p>Mandibuzz best fits on balance and stall builds that enjoy its mixed walling and key utility features. Skeledirge is a great partner, as its typing and ability let it handle annoying Pokemon like Hydrapple and Cobalion somewhat consistently, while also helping against Tera Electric Calm Mind Latios. Toxapex also is a great partner, being a fantastic Knock Off absorber against Tornadus-T and Lokix, while also handling threats like Azumarill and Greninja that Mandibuzz struggles against. Tinkaton can not only act as a secondary check to Latios so that Mandibuzz won't get overwhelmed, but also beat the threatening Ogerpon-C. Mandibuzz also struggles a lot against Zapdos, so it synergizes well with Zapdos checks like Rhyperior, Hippowdon, and Bellibolt. In addition, Rhyperior and Hippowdon happen to also check Hisuian Arcanine, another Pokemon that Mandibuzz struggles against. Excadrill is another Pokemon that can give Mandibuzz trouble, so a check like Hydrapple or Slowking is necessary. Slowking also has the benefit of providing more assurance against Latios.</p>"

Volt Switch allows Cobalion to pivot out on would-be switch-ins such as Latios and Zapdos and bring in a teammate to threaten them out. Thunder Wave can punish Tornadus-T and the aforementioned Latios for switching in, while Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-types like Thundurus-T and Zapdos super effectively. Leftovers gives Cobalion more longevity, allowing it to check opposing threats for an extended period of time, while Rocky Helmet allows it to punish Lokix more easily and get chip damage on other contact moves users such as Scizor and Tyranitar. Shuca Berry is another option that allows Cobalion to switch into or stay in on Earthquakes from unboosted Excadrill or Ursaluna. Tera Dragon gives Cobalion a resistance to Water-type attacks such as Surf from Greninja, which is then OHKOed back with Close Combat, while making it neutral to Ground and preserving its Grass resistance so it can still check Ogerpon. Tera Ghost allows it to preserve Stealth Rock in the event the opposing Excadrill uses its Tera to flip the matchup while also making Cobalion neutral to Ground-type attacks and immune to Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Scizor and opposing Cobalion. Tera Flying gives it an immunity to Ground-type attacks, allowing it to more easily answer even a Speed-boosted Excadrill. However, Cobalion's base typing is very useful for answering threats like Lokix, Scizor, and Tyranitar, so it should usually only Terastalize if there is no other option at the time.</p> <p>Cobalion fits on Volt Turn offense, bulky offense, and balance teams, utilizing its good matchups into the most common hazard removal options to keep Stealth Rock up for a solid portion of the game while using Volt Switch to bring threats onto the field. Unfortunately, Cobalion doesn't resist Flying and Psychic, so alternative checks to threats like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Latios are needed. Slowking can check both Latios and Tornadus-T while also providing Thunder Wave support so Cobalion is more free to use Taunt. In return, Cobalion can switch into Lokix and Scizor, which can threaten Slowking. Pivot Tornadus-T can act as a check to Latios while using Knock Off so that foes such as Zapdos and Skeledirge are susceptible to Cobalion's Stealth Rock and U-turn to continue the pivot chain. Sandy Shocks and Thundurus-T can both switch into Zapdos and block Volt Switch while also applying pressure on Ground-types like Rhyperior, as well as Cobalion checks like Hydrapple and Latios. Cobalion is also threatened by Okidogi, so ways to offensively pressure it like Excadrill, Latios, Zapdos, and the previously mentioned Tornadus-T are appreciated. The latter two, alongside Grass-types like Hydrapple and Zarude, also provide a Ground resistance to help cover Cobalion's weakness. Excadrill, on the other hand, provides a Latios check that can remove hazards while also offensively checking Skeledirge and Toxapex. Choice Specs Greninja offensively pressures everything that can threaten Cobalion, and it appreciates Cobalion's ability to draw in foes and pivot on them alongside Stealth Rock for chipping Assault Vest Tornadus-T into Ice Beam range.</p>"

Assault Vest helps Tornadus-T sponge powerful special attacks from threats like Latios, Greninja, and Hydrapple. Alternatively, it can opt for Heavy-Duty Boots to allow it to make the most out of Regenerator without a Stealth Rock weakness. Hurricane is an option over Bleakwind Storm if one wants to sacrifice accuracy for power and a confusion chance. Heat Wave provides coverage for Steel-types like Scizor, Excadrill, and Tinkaton, while Focus Blast is less accurate but is more powerful and hits Rock-types like Tyranitar and Hisuian Arcanine. Taunt is an option on Heavy-Duty Boots sets that disrupts utility moves like Thunder Wave from Slowking and Defog or Toxic from Mandibuzz, but it is often not worth losing out on coverage. 168 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow it to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon like Latios and Ogerpon-C, while 208 HP and 132 Special Defense EVs give it a good chance to withstand Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor from full HP, even without an Assault Vest. Tera Steel allows Tornadus-T to more easily switch into Latios and Hydrapple, helps it sponge hits from Ogerpon-C, and gives it a resistance to Stealth Rock. Tera Electric allows Tornadus-T to switch into Flying-types like Zapdos and opposing Tornadus-T while protecting it from Zapdos's Static. However, it is important to note that using these Tera types makes Tornadus-T weak to Ground and susceptible to Spikes, so Terastallization generally shouldn't be used unless needed.</p> <p>Pivot Tornadus-T fits on both offense and balance teams, utilizing its ability to force progress and its high Speed to help wear down the opposing team and bring in its teammates. However, having an Assault Vest means that it is susceptible to Stealth Rock damage, and thus, it appreciates having teammates that can remove entry hazards like Excadrill and Mandibuzz. Heavy-Duty Boots sets do not need as much but require backup checks to foes such as Greninja and Latios. It also appreciates other pivots like Zapdos and Lokix to help it switch in and out more to heal as well as additional Regenerator Pokemon for it to switch into like Hydrapple and Slowking. These Regenerator pivots make it easier for Tornadus-T to make use of its own Regenerator while also helping answer offensive threats it cannot handle like Rhyperior or Hisuian Arcanine. Hydrapple, as well as other Grass-types like Zarude and Sinistcha, also provides a second Ground-resistant team member should Tornadus-T be forced to Terastallize. Tornadus-T also appreciates Ground-types that can absorb Volt Switch from Zapdos such as Rhyperior, Hippowdon, and Sandy Shocks. Tornadus-T can be paired alongside fast offensive threats like Ogerpon to provide a team two fast progress-makers that can overwhelm defensive Pokemon like Hydrapple, Zapdos, and opposing Tornadus-T, and it also fits well alongside wallbreakers such as Mamoswine and Latios, which appreciate its ability to pivot them in.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Tornadus-T's fantastic Speed tier allows it to outspeed and force out many common threats such as Keldeo and Ogerpon, granting it many opportunities to set up a Nasty Plot. This turns it into a powerful wallbreaker that can muscle through standard checks such as Tinkaton, Slowking, and Toxapex. Hurricane's additional power is significant, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Keldeo, OHKOing bulkier variants of Azumarill at +2, and having a high chance to OHKO Latios after a Nasty Plot boost. Bleakwind Storm can still be considered, as it is slightly more reliable but will require support from entry hazards to make up for the slight drop in power. Heat Wave provides coverage to nail Steel-types like Tinkaton, Excadrill, and Metagross while also being a more reliable move into offensive threats like Lokix and Ogerpon. It is also one of Tornadus-T's best means to hit other Flying-resistant foes like Zapdos and Raikou for neutral damage. Focus Blast provides the necessary coverage to OHKO Pokemon like Tyranitar and Hisuian Arcanine. Weather Ball is an option on weather teams that allows Tornadus-T to OHKO Zapdos and opposing Tornadus-T in sand, as well as threatening the aforementioned Pokemon and Sandy Shocks in snow. U-turn is an alternative that provides some utility, allowing Tornadus-T to switch out of unfavorable matchups against Rhyperior and Empoleon to bring in a partner more capable of dealing with them. The EV spread has enough Speed to outpace base 115s like Raikou and Cinccino, while the bulk prevents it from being OHKOed by Tera Bug Silver Powder-boosted First Impression from Lokix. Tera Electric removes its Electric weakness in a pinch to better deal with Zapdos and Raikou while also avoiding Thunder Wave from Slowking and Tinkaton.</p> <p>Tornadus-T fits best on a variety of playstyles such as hyper offense, which can apply enough offensive pressure to defensive structures, or bulky offense and balance teams that can provide a strong enough backbone to support a more offensive set. Toxapex and Slowking can form a Regenerator core with Tornadus-T, which can help offset the severity of any drawbacks from it potentially missing a move against Pokemon such as Azumarill and Latios. Slowking can also provide Thunder Wave support to cripple faster threats to Tornadus-T such as Greninja and use Chilly Reception to bring Tornadus-T in against Pokemon like Hydrapple while setting snow if using Weather Ball. Skeledirge is a pain for Tornadus-T to break through, so partners like Hisuian Arcanine and Tyranitar can apply pressure to it, the former two also having a great matchup against Zapdos that Tornadus-T can struggle to break without Terastilizing into an Electric-type. Sandy Shocks can also help pressure Zapdos and provide entry hazard support, like the three aforementioned Pokemon, to help wear down Tornadus-T's checks. Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Hisuian Arcanine, and Rhyperior are massive problems for Tornadus-T to break if it lacks Focus Blast, so partners like Keldeo and Greninja are ideal, and they all greatly appreciate being brought in safely against them if Tornadus-T is running U-turn. Lokix and Scizor invite Zapdos in and remove its Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, allowing it to be weakened into range of a Nasty Plot-boosted Heat Wave. They can also bring Tornadus-T in safely against Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Okidogi to find opportunities to set up a Nasty Plot to start wallbreaking. Their strong priority moves are also extremely beneficial for removing faster foes such as Choice Scarf Latios and Greninja.</p>"

Surf is the best option to deal strong damage, as Hydro Pump can unfortunately miss and lacks PP. However, Hydro Pump could still be an option to inflict more damage, as it can OHKO defensive Excadrill and 2HKO defensive Tyranitar and Tinkaton, though Surf deals with these Pokemon with entry hazards anyway. Ice Beam is able to hit Tornadus-T, Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Ogerpon-C super effectively, whereas Sludge Wave can surprise common switch-ins like Azumarill and Keldeo and gives Greninja a resistance to Fighting-type moves, such as Secret Sword, allowing it to 2HKO Keldeo. Spikes chips the opposing team in the long term and punishes switch-ins, helping Greninja and its teammates clean more easily. Greninja naturally finds some good opportunities to set up a layer of Spikes or two thanks to the switches it naturally forces. U-turn is an alternative that grants Greninja some momentum, allowing it to pivot out on Pokemon that can wall it such as Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Toxapex. Tera Water is preferred to boost the power of Greninja's Water-type move, guaranteeing an OHKO on Scizor and Cobalion with Surf and a 2HKO on Keldeo with Hydro Pump, although it shouldn't Terastallize outside of an emergency because it'll lose the boost of Protean.</p> <p>Due to its severe frailty and incapacity to switch in easily, Greninja fits well on bulky offense teams that can afford slow VoltTurn support to bring it safely into battle, and they also provide some defensive backbones for Greninja to rely on. Teammates such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Slowking are thus very appreciated. Zapdos is also a strong answer to Azumarill, while Slowking can be useful to pressure Toxapex and Gastrodon with Future Sight. Excadrill is a helpful partner that can help Greninja by crushing common Water-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W, allowing Greninja to spam its Water-type move. Also, Excadrill is capable of removing entry hazards, which can be a little overwhelming for Greninja. In the same way, Knock Off support helps Greninja by removing crucial items such as Assault Vest on Tornadus-T and Heavy-Duty Boots on Slowking and Volcanion. Examples of users would be Tornadus-T and Tinkaton. Since Greninja causes a lot of switches, hazard setters like Sandy Shocks and Cobalion are helpful. Cobalion can also check the powerful Lokix. Lastly, offensive teammates such as Calm Mind Latios and Comfey like the opposing team weakened by Greninja's powerful moves so that they can clean up, while others such as Ogerpon-C and Lokix can overwhelm their shared checks with Choice Specs Greninja, with examples of these being Toxapex, Tinkaton, and Empoleon.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp lets Skeledirge neuter many offensive threats such as Tyranitar and Okidogi, and it works in tandem with Hex to overwhelm defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Zapdos. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Skeledirge from being worn down by entry hazards, letting it handle Pokemon like Okidogi variants lacking Knock Off and Calm Mind Latios more reliably. Tera Fairy is the most common Tera option, granting Skeledirge a very useful defensive typing that stops many threats like Hydrapple, Quaquaval, Lokix, and Calm Mind Latios, in addition to being a good neutral typing that helps it burn foes like Azumarill and Ogerpon-C. Tera Water lets Skeledirge check Azumarill, Greninja, Mamoswine, and Sand Rush Excadrill more efficiently. Tera Steel helps Skeledirge wall all Latios sets, Ogerpon, and Ogerpon-C while still checking Greninja, and Skeledirge gains a Toxic immunity, which can be useful for switching into Toxapex and Mandibuzz. However, every Tera type has downsides that flip certain matchups that may be unfavorable for Skeledirge. Tera Fairy makes it vulnerable to Metagross and Scizor, Tera Water makes it very weak to Zapdos and Hydrapple, and Tera Steel opens up a nasty weakness to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that can be unfavorable, especially since it now loses to foes it should check, like Okidogi and Cobalion, ultimately meaning that general caution should be exerted when choosing to Terastallize Skeledirge.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits best on balance and fat builds that cover its defensive weaknesses and accommodate its need to Terastallize in-game. Switch-ins to Knock Off, such as Toxapex and Cobalion, are arguably mandatory teammates, answering critical threats that force Skeledirge out due to the threat of Knock Off such as Azumarill and Lokix. Cobalion offensively checks dangerous wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Ursaluna, and Ogerpon-C that can overwhelm Skeledirge. Slowking, Empoleon, and the aforementioned Toxapex form great cores with Skeledirge, answering annoying Water-types like Keldeo, Greninja, and Azumarill that typically force Skeledirge to Terastallize; not to mention, Toxapex and Slowking do a great job at checking Hisuian Arcanine, which can freely switch into Skeledirge. Slowking and Tinkaton can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave to boost the power of Hex while also being valuable scouts to see if Latios is running Choice Specs, which Skeledirge fails to check, or Calm Mind. Hydrapple and Mandibuzz are great teammates that can handle Mold Breaker Excadrill; both can serve as middle-grounds into Ursaluna while Mandibuzz can also provide support with Defog to clear entry hazards in the event that Skeledirge gets hit with Knock Off. Mandibuzz can also take out Pokemon that might reactively Tera into Fire-resistant Tera types to handle Skeledirge, like Excadrill and Scizor. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Calm Mind + Tera Electric Latios can remove annoying Pokemon like Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos that stand in the way of a Skeledirge sweep with Torch Song. In return, Skeledirge's ability to spread burns can open up more opportunities for these teammates to set up.</p>"

Tinted Lens prevents foes from playing around Lokix with defensive Terastallization, meaning they will all be hit for neutral damage at worst. Knock Off punishes common switch-ins like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Sucker Punch is additional priority that allows Lokix to pick off foes like Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock and First Impression damage. Tera Bug is used to blow past Excadrill and Azumarill, letting Lokix KO the latter after Belly Drum if Stealth Rock is up. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Lokix to dash in and out of the field easily. Silver Powder puts an additional kick into First Impression, OHKOing Choice Scarf Mienshao, Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock, and Excadrill with a layer of Spikes after Tera Bug at the cost of Lokix taking entry hazard damage, limiting the amount of entry points in a game. On such sets, Leech Life can be used over Knock Off to retain longevity, at the cost of forgoing the ability to punish common switch-ins. Adamant should be used most often for maximum damage output, but Jolly allows Lokix to nail Hisuian Arcanine before it uses Extreme Speed and pivot out freely on Excadrill.</p> <p>Lokix fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, acting as a potent revenge killer to offensive threats. Offensive partners like Latios and Ogerpon-C appreciate Lokix's U-turn freely bringing them in on Cobalion and Zapdos. Removing Zapdos in particular is very important to let Lokix more freely pivot around without worry about Static. Slowking forms an excellent pivoting core with Lokix, as slow Chilly Reception can bring Lokix in safely on Pokemon that threaten Slowking such as Greninja and Ogerpon and it can handle the likes of Toxapex and Cobalion. Slowking's Future Sight support can also dissuade Toxapex and Okidogi from wanting to switch into Lokix in the first place. Other pivots like Zapdos and Thunder Wave Rotom-W can handle Tornadus-T through paralysis, giving Lokix more room to pivot in and out. Lokix greatly appreciates entry hazard support to more easily revenge kill Excadrill. Tinkaton appreciates Lokix's Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots for Stealth Rock while in return handling Ogerpon-C and Comfey. Spikes setters such as Sandy Shocks and Ogerpon can take on Zapdos and Hippowdon. Excadrill is a fantastic partner for Silver Powder sets especially, as it removes entry hazards for Lokix to freely pivot around and helps overwhelm Zapdos and Tornadus-T. In return, Lokix nails Hydrapple and can give Excadrill safe entry against Rotom-W and Toxapex. Slower wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mamoswine appreciate having faster checks like Ogerpon and Sand Rush Excadrill dealt with.</p>"

Certain teams prefer Tinkaton to use Thunder Wave, though, since they can fit another Stealth Rock setter; this can help significantly when dealing with foes like Latios and Spiky Shield Ogerpon-C. Knock Off is excellent utility that prevents Tinkaton from being passive, removing items from Excadrill, Zapdos, and Hisuian Arcanine. Encore is Tinkaton's most useful asset, letting it use its typing and bulk to checkmate foes like Latios and Hydrapple. Leftovers is preferred on Mold Breaker sets so that Tinkaton has some longevity, with Mold Breaker proving useful to let it OHKO Ogerpon-C and Mimikyu despite their abilities. Pickpocket with an Air Balloon can let it steal items from Excadrill, Ogerpon, and Lokix, which can help immensely in fending these threats off. The given EVs allow Tinkaton to KO Latios with Knock Off followed by Gigaton Hammer while surviving a +2 Superpower from Ogerpon-C. Play Rough is a niche option that lets Tinkaton more directly pressure Greninja and Latios, but it is extremely weak against foes it doesn't hit super effectively. Tera Flying lets Tinkaton use Encore after Excadrill's Earthquake, while Tera Ghost in combination with Air Balloon lets it wall Ursaluna. Tera Dark helps Tinkaton against strong Psychic-type attackers like Hoopa-U and Choice Specs Latios, while Tera Dragon lets it check Greninja and Belly Drum Azumarill.</p> <p>Tinkaton's incredible typing and utility let it fit on all kinds of bulky offense and balance teams, using Stealth Rock to support teammates like Tyranitar and Lokix that love to weaken checks with Knock Off. It's also a good partner for teammates like Sandy Shocks and Rotom-W that dislike dealing with Latios. Tinkaton's flexibility lets it use its bulk to tank huge attacks and lock foes into them with Encore; for example, it often needs to lock Greninja into Surf or Okidogi into Drain Punch. As such, teammates that can handle these attacks like Slowking and Hydrapple can be very useful to have. They also help signficantly against Excadrill, which Tinkaton tends to let in for free. Teams that use Tinkaton should aim to make progress fairly quickly; while it's a great stopgap to all kinds of threats, its lack of reliable recovery prevents it from lasting forever, so it needs progress-making teammates like Hisuian Arcanine and Mamoswine, which can help it create favorable game states.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ogerpon functions as a solid pivot within the tier thanks to an array of excellent utility moves, a powerful STAB move in Ivy Cudgel, and great offensive stats. Knock Off allows Ogerpon to punish many of the Pokemon attempting to switch into it such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge. U-turn allows Ogerpon to pivot out of matchups that are unfavorable for it such as Tinkaton, Okidogi, and Skeledirge while doing solid damage to Hydrapple that may want to switch in, and thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots, it is able to remain healthy throughout the match and easily pivot in and out of the field. Encore gives it the ability to take advantage of slower Pokemon that have locked themselves into an awkward move so it can go for a free move the turn after, such as Zapdos using Roost or Mandibuzz clicking Defog, which, when paired with Defiant, gives Ogerpon a free Attack boost. On the other hand, Ogerpon is able to use the pressure it creates as opportunities to set up Spikes for its team, helping its teammates and itself by slowly chipping down the opposing team's checks. Ogerpon's Tera type is locked into Grass, but with Embody Aspect, it is given a boost to its Speed on top of the additional boost to its STAB moves, letting it OHKO Slowking and have a chance to 2HKO Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. This means that Ogerpon can act not only as a powerful breaker with Tera, but also as an emergency speed control option that can outrun every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, as well as a number of boosted Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Excadrill after Rapid Spin. Ogerpon's Speed boost also allows it to have unique interactions with Encore, switching in on faster Pokemon to lock them into set up moves such as Calm Mind Latios or Dragon Dance Salamence.</p> <p>Ogerpon's pivoting and utility options are best suited on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to disrupt foes while bringing in their own threats. Wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mamoswine love Ogerpon's ability to pivot them in safely, weaken their checks, and potentially set up Spikes for them to break more easily; In return, they are able to deal with some of Ogerpon's checks such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Hydrapple. Pivots that are able to synergize well with Ogerpon such as Slowking, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos make for excellent partners, being able to form a strong core while relieving Ogerpon of the pressure of taking on threats like Latios, Excadrill, and Lokix. Stealth Rock setters such as Tinkaton and Cobalion mesh well with Ogerpon that opt for Spikes by maximizing the entry hazard stacking potential, with Tinkaton able to fit Encore instead while taking on Greninja and Zapdos, while Cobalion can effectively deal with Excadrill and Lokix for it. Sandy Shocks is an excellent teammate for Ogerpon, being able to take on the Flying-types that it's afraid of, creating a VoltTurn core with it, and being able to set up Stealth Rock for it while Ogerpon handles the Water- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Sandy Shocks well while beating its key checks like Azumarill and Rotom-Wash.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-C is a terrifying powerhouse, with very few defensive Pokemon able to resist its STAB combination or stand up to its sheer power after a Swords Dance. Ivy Cudgel is the STAB move of choice, capable of nailing even checks like Tinkaton and Hydrapple with a 2HKO after boosting. Power Whip, while inconsistent due to poor accuracy, is also notably stronger, allowing Ogerpon-C to OHKO offensive threats like Keldeo and Azumarill and have a chance at OHKOing Excadrill without boosting. Alternatively, while less immediately powerful, Horn Leech's healing can help Ogerpon-C to survive revenge killing attempts, and in some cases, even allow for multiple uses of Sturdy. However, while it does obtain OHKOs and 2HKOs on most notable targets, especially after a Swords Dance, the drastically lower power can cause Ogerpon-C to miss important OHKOs on targets like Slowking and Tyranitar, especially if unboosted. Ogerpon-C's last moveslot is immensely customizable thanks to its near perfect STAB combination; Superpower gets key damage on Steel-types such as Tinkaton, Cobalion, and Metagross, while Spiky Shield helps to prevent being revenge killed by Lokix's First Impression and can allow Ogerpon-C to avoid being hit by Tinkaton's Gigaton Hammer entirely. It also scouts Choice Scarf users like Latios and Okidogi. Sturdy allows Ogerpon-C to be significantly more aggressive, with the ability to live any one hit from full HP allowing it to pose much more of a threat against Pokemon like Latios and Excadrill. Embody Aspect also gives Ogerpon-C unique defensive properties through Terastallization, with the Defense boost helping to improve the odds of living attacks like Scizor's Bullet Punch, and shedding Ogerpon-C's Grass typing can be handy against opposing Lokix, especially if it is not carrying Spiky Shield.</p> <p>Ogerpon-C fits on a wide variety of teams thanks to its high firepower, as well as its access to Sturdy allowing it to serve as an emergency check to certain threats. Entry hazard setters like Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks are valued teammates, with the chip damage they provide helping Ogerpon-C to have an even easier time securing kills. These Pokemon are also capable of helping to manage foes that may annoy Ogerpon-C such as Latios and Tornadus-T. Pivots such as Slowking and Tornadus-T are also valuable for their ability to get Ogerpon-C in safely. Methods of speed control, such as Sticky Web from Araquanid, or Pokemon that can spread paralysis such as Zapdos, Tinkaton, Slowking, and Rotom-W, are also appreciated to help Ogerpon-C get the jump on faster foes. Choice Specs Latios makes a strong partner, as it can help Ogerpon-C to deal with Okidogi, and the two can whittle down shared checks like Tinkaton and Scizor. Excadrill also greatly appreciates Ogerpon-C's ability to smash pesky Flying-types, especially Zapdos, and Ogerpon-C greatly benefits from Excadrill's hazard removal allowing it to keep Sturdy intact, as well as the extra support against Latios and Tinkaton. Powerful revenge killers, such as Lokix, are also appreciated for their ability to deal with Greninja and to pick off weakened Pokemon that Ogerpon-C may not be able to finish off.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Hydrapple serves as a solid balance breaker, using its bulk and offensive prowess to handle threats like Excadrill while also being scary for foes like Tornadus-T and Metagross once is has set up Nasty Plot. It also has Regenerator to heal off any damage taken while checking these threats, allowing it to potentially repeat this process later in the game. Fickle Beam is an alternative move over Draco Meteor so Hydrapple can avoid the Special Attack drop while having a chance to deal more damage than Draco Meteor, allowing it to maintain its Nasty Plot boosts and to remain a big threat after firing it off. However using Fickle Beam means Hydrapple can miss out on KOs against foes like Zapdos and Tornadus-T if the boost doesn't activate. Earth Power provides coverage for Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross so that they cannot easily come in to cause issues for Hydrapple. Heavy-Duty Boots serves to make Hydrapple's healing from Regenerator more effective while improving its longevity by removing its vulnerability to entry hazards, as it commonly has to utilize its great typing to switch into powerful wallbreakers like Excadrill and Ogerpon. Maximum HP and maximum Defense make Hydrapple incredibly difficult for physical attackers to break, letting it better soak up U-turn from Scizor, Lokix, and Zarude as well as powerful hits from wallbreakers like Hisuian Arcanine or Tyranitar so that it can more easily set up Nasty Plot. Tera Steel improves its matchup against Ogerpon-C while also giving it a Toxic immunity to help against Toxapex and Mandibuzz, a Flying resistandce so it can set up Nasty Plot in front of Tornadus-T, and a Fairy resistance useful for dodging an OHKO from Choice Band Azumarill's Play Rough in case of emergency. Tera Fairy lets it set up more easily on Latios and opposing Hydrapple without gaining weaknesses to Excadrill and Mamoswine. However, Terastalizing Hydrapple removes its beneficial resistances to Ground and Electric, making it tougher to handle Volt Switch users such as Sandy Shocks and Rotom-W.</p> <p>Hydrapple acts as a solid wallbreaker for balance and bulky offensive playstyles, using its defensive profile to switch into foes that are offensively threatening or tough to break and then becoming a threat of its own. Slowking is a nice partner for it, forming a double Regenerator core that helps work around some problems for Hydrapple such as Tornadus-T and Tinkaton while acting a secondary Water resist in the event Hydrapple needs to Tera. Slowking also slow pivots to Hydrapple with Chilly Reception after soaking up a hit, allowing Hydrapple to either be a bigger threat due to having more HP or get its HP back from Regenerator more easiliy. Additionally, Slowking can use Thunder Wave against foes like Tinkaton and Mandibuzz to make them slower than Hydrapple, allowing it to more easily set up Nasty Plot. Zapdos is also a good teammate, defensively answering Scizor and Lokix, which can pose problems with their strong U-turn should they switch in on Hydrapple when it’s chipped. Hydrapple appreciates teammates that can help wear down Tinkaton into Earth Power range such as Lokix and Tornadus-T. It also appreciates Pokemon that can help pressure or defensively answer Flying-types such as Tyranitar or Rhyperior. Hydrapple apprecieates Stealth Rock setters like Cobalion and the previously mentioned Rhyperior to get targets into range of its boosted attacks more easily. Sand teams appreciate Hydrapple's defensive profile in tandem with Regenerator, it can use an Eject Button to safely bring in Excadrill and act as check to opposing Excadrill and Keldeo, which can be scary for sand teams otherwise.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Hydrapple is a dangerous wallbreaker that provides a lot of defensive utility through its typing to answer threats like Excadrill, Sandy Shocks, and Ogerpon. Leaf Storm and Draco Meteor are powerful and spammable STAB moves despite the Special Attack drop drawback. Earth Power provides coverage against Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross. Hydrapple lacks coverage outside of Earth Power, so Fickle Beam is usually preferred to have a secondary Dragon-type STAB move that doesn't have the ramification of lowering its Special Attack. Similarly, Giga Drain is another option to provide a secondary Grass-type STAB move that doesn't force Hydrapple to switch out and provides it with more longevity. Regenerator helps Hydrapple answer Excadrill and the Ogerpon formes and provides ample opportunities for Hydrapple to get into a position to wallbreak by keeping it healthy across a match. The EV spread allows Hydrapple to outspeed Azumarill and Ursaluna while maximizing its damage output. Tera Steel should primarily be used for its defensive value to flip the matchup against threats like Latios, Azumarill, and Scizor. Tera Fairy allows Hydrapple to combat Latios and opposing Hydrapple. However, Hydrapple should only Terastallize when necessary, as giving up its great defensive typing greatly hinders its matchup against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Excadrill.</p> <p>Hydrapple fits best on offensive teams that can help it get in safely and take pressure off it being the sole answer to the likes of Excadrill and Ogerpon. Pivots such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos are fantastic partners for these reasons; the former forms a Regenerator core, while the latter can punish Pokemon like Scizor and Azumarill with Static, crippling them for Hydrapple to outspeed. Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross prevent Hydrapple from easily locking into its STAB moves, so Pokemon like Excadrill, Slowking, and Sandy Shocks can help check and apply pressure on them. Excadrill notably provides Rapid Spin support to prevent Hydrapple being worn down by entry hazards and can act as a check to Latios, allowing Hydrapple to preserve the option to Terastallize. Sandy Shocks can provide Spikes support to wear down Pokemon like specially defensive Tyranitar and Toxapex into OHKO range while also checking Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Assault Vest Tornadus-T is a fairly consistent pivot into Hydrapple, so it is essential to have means to overwhelm it. Tyranitar, Tinkaton, and Rhyperior can provide Stealth Rock support to restrict Tornadus-T's ability to pivot into Hydrapple while being great defensive checks to Tornadus-T. Tinkaton can also provide Knock Off support to help remove key items like Tornadus-T's Assault Vest. Other Knock Off users like Scizor and Lokix can also achieve this while also getting Hydrapple in against Pokemon they struggle to get through like Toxapex and Cobalion.</p>"
