    "overview": "<p>With a kit tailor-made for enabling partners, Blastoise stands out as DOU's definitive pure support pick. Access to all of Fake Out, Follow Me, and a pivot move in Flip Turn makes Blastoise incredibly effective at controlling the board and generating space for teammates to operate. Its respectable defenses leave it quite adept at soaking up attacks for its team; its pure-Water typing can be a mixed bag, though, only truly vulnerable to Grass-types such as Rillaboom but giving little in meaningful resistances. Blastoise generally fits best in fast, aggressive teams that feature threatening setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Nasty Plot Spectrier, and Quiver Dance Volcarona. While Blastoise does compete with Amoonguss as a redirector and Tapu Fini as a bulky Water-type, it can be a better fit for borderline hyper offensive compositions that prefer its dynamic, positioning-oriented arsenal over slow, controlling utility of Amoonguss's Spore and Tapu Fini's terrain control. Most glaringly, though, Blastoise's focus on sponging hits can let strong attackers like Urshifu-R and Zygarde simply overwhelm it or ignore the redirection; its lack of any offensive presence whatsoever means its partners must be threatening enough to make the support count.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to it being the fastest Pokemon with access to Snow Warning, Alolan Ninetales is the preferred weather setter on hail teams. Its high Speed is particularly important, as it allows Alolan Ninetales to set Aurora Veil before attackers such as Kyurem-B and Heatran can attack, making it significantly easier to set. Alolan Ninetales's Speed also allows to outspeed and threaten Landorus with Blizzard, which also deals a considerable amount of damage to Pokemon like Rillaboom and Naganadel. However, Alolan Ninetales lacks any significant defensive utility due to its poor defensive typing and meager bulk, neither of which are attributes that a Pokemon that needs to be switching in to reset the weather would want. Other weathers removing hail also significantly hurt Alolan Ninetales due to its heavy reliance on hail. On top of that, its mediocre Special Attack allows Heatran and Volcanion, among other Pokemon that resist its attacks, to come in with minimal risk. Due to these flaws, Alolan Ninetales is restricted to hail teams that can make up for its lackluster offense, with Landorus and Urshifu-R beating the Fire- and Steel-types that threaten Alolan Ninetales and Kyurem taking advantage of hail with its own Blizzard. Alolan Ninetales can also be used on certain setup spam teams, thanks to Aurora Veil allowing Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Kyurem-B and Shift Gear Genesect to set up more easily.</p>",

Chansey can apply offensive pressure with Seismic Toss and Toxic while also acting as a late-game wincon if all opposing physical attackers are taken care of. Chansey's Defense does leave a lot to be desired even with Eviolite, however, leaving it extremely vulnerable to physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Incineroar. The former of whom threatens to OHKO Chansey, while the latter can remove its Eviolite with Knock Off. Chansey is also very passive due to its low initial damage, allowing the special attackers it's supposed to check to attack Chansey's teammates without much fear of Chansey itself. Incineroar is a great partner for Chansey, as its Intimidate helps patch up Chansey's Defense.

Its Electric typing offensively covers Urshifu-R, Volcanion, and Tapu Fini, while its Flying type allows it to defensively cover Rillaboom and Genesect. Zapdos' high Special Attack and ability to pivot out of the field means it is rarely passive as a support Pokemon. These traits and respectable bulk place it as a useful glue on fast-paced teams, supporting offensive behemoths such as Urshifu-R and Kyurem-B. On these types of teams, it faces competition from other Tailwind users such as the speedier and more offensive Naganadel, though its Volt Switch and durability set it apart. Zapdos is plagued by some poor matchups into tier mainstays such as Kyurem-B, Zygarde, and Diancie. Additionally, most of Zapdos's utility comes from its relatively fast Tailwind, meaning Taunt and Trick Room will render its main strength useless.</p>",

A all-out rain attacking set with Life Orb, carrying Thunder as its Electric-type STAB move, turns Zapdos into a major threat that also carries useful speed control.

  "Zapdos-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Hailing from the Crown Tundra, the regional variant of Zapdos distinguishes itself as a strong, fast attacker thanks to its good Speed and great STAB combination. Galarian Zapdos also has the benefit of being a physical attacker that punishes Intimidate attempts with its Defiant ability, which makes it even stronger. Its Fighting / Flying typing grants it an excellent STAB combination that threatens many excellent Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, Kyurem-B, and Incineroar. In particular, Galarian Zapdos is one of the best Rillaboom counters thanks to its resistance to Grass-type moves and ability to OHKO it with Brave Bird. This makes it one of the best partners for Tapu Fini, which greatly appreciates one of its greatest threats being removed. Another great teammate is Zygarde, who also loves Galarian Zapdos handling Rillaboom, along with it discouraging Intimidate from the likes of Incineroar and Landorus-T. Thanks to the combination of its base 100 Speed and the boost from Choice Scarf, Galarian Zapdos is able to outspeed Kyurem-B after a Dragon Dance, as well as common users of Choice Scarf, most notably Genesect. Galarian Zapdos's ability to consistently be the fastest Pokemon on the field is invaluable for bulkier teams that can struggle against more offensive teams. However, Galarian Zapdos struggles against the same bulkier teams, as Pokemon with high Defense like Tapu Fini and Diancie are mainstays on those teams, and Galarian Zapdos can struggle to break past them. Its damage can also be lackluster against neutral targets without a rare Defiant boost. Galarian Zapdos's poor defenses also make it dead weight against opposing speed control, and its reliance on Choice Scarf makes it very susceptible to Fake Out putting it in a vulnerable situation, along with the move lock being easily exploited. On top of that, it faces stiff competition from fellow Fighting-type Urshifu-R, which indirectly ignores Intimidate via Surging Strikes, while also being able to ignore Protect thanks to Unseen Fist.</p>",

Mew is often used as a lead, to set up either speed control or hazards early on, or as a mid-game Tailwind enabler. Pokemon with strong spread moves, such as Choice Band Zygarde and Heatran, benefit from Mew's ability to reliably set Tailwind. Pokemon such as Genesect, Incineroar, and Tyranitar can threaten Mew with super effective attacks; teammates such as Heatran, Zygarde, and Urshifu-R can make use of Tailwind to put pressure on these threats.

While it does compete in this niche with Ribombee, Crobat's access to Taunt comes in handy for maintaining its team's Speed advantage, preventing opposing Tailwind and Trick Room setters such as Naganadel and Diancie from being problematic. Strong teammates such as Urshifu-R, Landorus, and Heatran are preferred to capitalize on Crobat's Tailwind, with these three in particular being notable for decimating Diancie. One must be wary of opposing Zeraora, however, which completely counters Crobat because it is faster, can prevent Tailwind with Taunt, and hits Crobat super effectively with Plasma Fists. Partners such as Zygarde, Rillaboom, and Kyurem-B are preferred to deal with Zeraora, and these Pokemon are competitive beneficiaries of Tailwind as well.

    "overview": "<p>Politoed is one of the primary rain setters due to Drizzle alongside decent defensive typing and stats, although it has lackluster offensive presence. It can often survive long enough to set rain multiple times, maintaining weather control. Attackers like Urshifu-R, Zapdos, Kingdra, and Tornadus take advantage of rain, and Helping Hand boosts their strength even further. Scald burns and support moves such as Icy Wind and Encore give Politoed further utility value beyond setting rain. A major drawback Politoed faces is matching up poorly against a plethora of common Pokemon, such as Rillaboom, Tapu Fini, Kyurem-B, Amoonguss, and Dragapult, among others. The aforementioned teammates, along with others like Genesect and Tsareena, can help this, though. Politoed's relative passivity can also clash with the typically fast-paced nature of rain teams. Therefore, it faces competition from Pelipper as a rain setter, which has Hurricane to deal with troublesome Grass-types and Tailwind, making it more offensively suited than Politoed.</p>",

Sitrus Berry complements Politoed's natural bulk, but it is usually inferior to Eject Button or Damp Rock for maintaining rain.

  "Kingdra": {
    "overview": "<p>While Kingdra does stand out as the best Swift Swim attacker in SS DOU, it still leaves a lot to be desired. Its Speed in rain gives it a notable amount of utility, as it can pin down faster, frailer foes while it breaks the opposing team with strong rain-boosted Muddy Waters. In particular, Kingdra excels in using its offensive presence to give its teammates space and clean up weakened teams. However, it has multiple awkward matchups in the metagame, including against DOU's top threats in Rillaboom, Tapu Fini, and Kyurem-B, and its average Special Attack stat can at times feel lacking, which is a major downside, as it offers no utility outside of purely attacking. Kingdra, in particular, faces stiff competition as a Water-type attacker in rain from Urshifu-R, which boasts noticeably better power output and coverage, an improved matchup against Trick Room, more relevant utility in the ability to force trades with Unseen Fist, and most importantly a non-reliance on rain to be effective; while Kingdra does offer blazing Speed and a better match-up against fast Dragon-types in Dragapult and Naganadel, its Speed is also easily compensated for by the rain archetype's many Tailwind-setting Flying-type options in Tornadus and Zapdos, and its need for Speed also leaves it much more vulnerable in the face of opposing speed control. Kingdra's reliance on keeping its rain setter available, as it is very lacking as an attacker without it, on top of its other flaws, ultimately makes it quite awkward to run on rain teams.</p>",

On these teams, Rillaboom provides Fake Out support and checks Urshifu-R, while Volcanion and Diancie benefit from Trick Room, with Diancie being a secondary setter. However, if lacking a Download boost, Porygon2 can find itself being ignored due providing subpar offensive pressure. Porygon2 also has to be cautious of Knock Off from Incineroar and Toxic from Blastoise, which can severely cripple it.

    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar is the main pillar of sand teams in Doubles OU; its massive Special Defense and strong Attack let it act as the archetype's defensive backbone and take on threats such as Landorus, Naganadel, and Necrozma, while Sand Stream synergizes perfectly with Sand Rush attackers. Tyranitar has many set options to choose from to help it fit better on a team, but struggles to overcome its low Speed and common weaknesses; it also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome. Teammates like Excadrill, Dracozolt, and Dracovish appreciate doubled Speed in the sand, and in return, take down many of Tyranitar's checks, such as Tapu Fini, Urshifu-R, and Diancie. However, these cores struggle against Rillaboom and Ferrothorn, which must be checked elsewhere on the team. Offensive Tailwind setters such as Naganadel and Zapdos are especially beneficial for Tyranitar, as they check Rillaboom, Ferrothorn, and Urshifu-R while bringing another form of speed control to the team to help Tyranitar's middling Speed. Ultimately, sand is a niche archetype in the format, and Tyranitar in particular has many issues holding it back from consistency.</p>",

Dragon Tail makes Tyranitar an excellent phazer, spreading entry hazard damage and preventing Trick Room. Assault Vest boosts Tyranitar's already strong Special Defense stat to incredible heights and lets it trade hits with Landorus and Volcanion even better. Additionally, Assault Vest gives room for additional coverage in Superpower and Heavy Slam for targets like Heatran and Diancie. Safety Goggles lets Tyranitar function as an Amoonguss check, further supporting this role with Taunt to protect its teammates. Choice Band lets it threaten massive damage with physical coverage options such as Ice Punch and Superpower, however it lacks staying power and gets worn down quickly. Tyranitar can make great use of Thunder Wave to function as additional speed control and provide value other than setting sand but must sacrifice an important moveslot. Custap Berry can surprise opponents who rely on Fighting coverage to KO Tyranitar and nab surprise KOes though is less consistent overall.</p>",

These traits make it a more offensive option than its rival setter Politoed, which has greater bulk and range of utility options for a more supportive role. Hurricane is great for removing Grass-types like Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and Tsareena on behalf of teammates such as Urshifu-R and Kingdra, which are also prime beneficiaries of rain. Using Pokemon like them, and other rain teammates like Zapdos and Tornadus, is vital for making full use of Pelipper's utility. Unfortunately, outside of super effective hits, Pelipper is underwhelming offensively, and it's often a vulnerable target if left on the field due to its subpar bulk and middling Speed. Its particularly low Special Defense means even strong neutral attacks can be quite threatening. The problem is worsened by Pelipper's weakness to common Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Tapu Fini, Zeraora, and Dragapult. This harms Pelipper's ability to set rain multiple times when needed, something the more defensive Politoed is usually better at doing.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wide Guard is useful for stopping strong spread attacks, most notably Zygarde's Thousand Arrows and Diancie's Diamond Storm.

Eruption, in particular, is amazing for getting as much damage on the board as possible in the limited amount of turns that Trick Room is up. Its passable natural bulk, particularly its solid Defense, makes it difficult to KO in one hit without a special Ground- or Rock-type attack. However, Torkoal has its limitations: namely, entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes, which greatly limit its offensive potential, as they cripple Eruption's power as soon as Torkoal enters the battlefield. Additionally, its reliance on Trick Room, and accordingly, multiple Trick Room setters like Porygon2, Diancie, and Necrozma, and sun means that it needs to work hard to get the most out of the few turns it is afforded. Even then, other Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcanion give it stiff competition for a slot on semi-Trick Room teams. It also despises Fake Out users like Incineroar and Zeraora if it isn't paired with some sort of priority blocker like Tapu Lele, Indeedee-F, or Tsareena, as they can stall its Trick Room turns.</p>",

Along with its direct offense, Metagross can passively damage foes with Stealth Rock and Toxic. It's also an excellent check to several dangerous Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Diancie, and Tapu Lele thanks to it resisting their STAB moves. Good teammates for Metagross include Tapu Fini, Rillaboom, and Kyurem-B. The former two check Urshifu-R and provide Terrain to let Metagross use Steel Roller. Tapu Fini and defensive Kyurem-B can both help check Heatran, and the latter two help check Landorus. In return, Metagross covers their respective weaknesses to Grass-types like Rillaboom, Ice-types like Kyurem-B, and Fairy-types like Tapu Fini. Metagross can also run Cosmic Power, turning into a fearsome bulky setup sweeper. Rillaboom provides Grassy Terrain healing and can produce free setup turns with Fake Out, making it the perfect partner for Cosmic Power Metagross. One of Metagross's main flaws is its middling Speed tier, meaning it often needs speed control from teammates. It always needs look out for strong Ground- and Fire-type moves coming from the likes of Zygarde, Landorus, Heatran, Volcanion, and Incineroar. Porygon2 can check Landorus and set Trick Room for Metagross, and Naganadel can check Zygarde, Landorus, and Volcanion while setting Tailwind. Metagross also barely damages Urshifu-R; Cosmic Power Metagross especially fears Surging Strikes, which can completely ignore its defensive boosts and 2HKO it.</p>",

Zen Headbutt can be run as a Psychic-type STAB attack that is best at damaging Urshifu-R and Amoonguss, but it's generally less effective than running Ice or Ground coverage. Hammer Arm provides Fighting coverage, but it's only more powerful against Porygon2 and Incineroar when compared to its standard attacks. The slot dedicated to a status move can be replaced with any of the aforementioned moves. An Assault Vest can make Metagross bulkier against special attackers in general, and with 112 EVs shifted from Attack to Special Defense, it can take an Eruption from Modest Charcoal Heatran.

Additionally, its typing and special bulk allow it to switch into strong Fire-type moves, such as Heatran's Eruption, and counterattack with moves such as Earth Power and Ice Beam. However, Gastrodon's typing makes it extremely vulnerable to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Additionally, Gastrodon is also fairly passive and has difficulty making a long-term impact on the game. Its effectiveness is also undermined by a lack of physical bulk, which also somewhat neuters its ability to counter physical Water-types that have neutral coverage. Gastrodon works best when paired with Pokemon that can take advantage of its ability to redirect Water-type moves. Diancie can gain some safety to set up Trick Room, while Fire types like Incineroar and Heatran also appreciate Gastrodon's ability to shut down threatening Water-type attackers. However, Gastrodon's 4x weakness to Grassy Glide means that it requires teammates that can switch into Rillaboom like Incineroar and Genesect. All in all, Gastrodon is overall a suboptimal pick that struggles to meaningfully benefit a team more than other options. Its weakness to some of the most potent Pokemon in the metagame means that facing a hard counter is extremely likely, and it doesn't provide enough utility for it to be worth it.</p>",

Despite these strengths, its lack of Speed and weakness to common offensive types make Heatran hard to justify in a team, along with facing competition from Volcanion and Incineroar as the Fire-type of the team. Heatran also gets easily threatened by common Pokemon such as Landorus, Urshifu-R, Tapu Fini, Kyurem-B, and Zygarde while also needing caution against Rillaboom and Metagross variants that often carry Ground coverage. Therefore, Heatran fits best on offensive teams, since it provides immediate damage and needs speed control to make up for its subpar Speed tier. Partners that can threaten Fire-resistant foes pair well with Heatran, such as Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, Zygarde, and Kyurem-B. Psychic-type spam deserves a special mention, since it appreciates a powerful Fire-type that can threaten Rillaboom and Steel-types, and it has Necrozma as a possible speed control option with Trick Room.

    "overview": "<p>Whimsicott has a usable niche as a decent support Pokemon, but it's seriously lacking in every other department. Its Prankster ability lets it to make excellent use of its wide support movepool, which includes moves like Fake Tears, Encore and Taunt, but most notably Tailwind. Prankster Tailwind is a great tool, as it immediately enables many strong attackers, and it can even be consistently set while opposing speed control is up, which is invaluable to the Hyper Offense teams Whimsicott is usually found on. Pokemon like Heatran, Urshifu-R, Zygarde, and Landorus especially appreciate Whimsicott's support, and the latter two can threaten the Fire-types, like Incineroar, that Whimsicott hates. Heatran and Landorus further benefit from Fake Tears. Whimiscott also has limited defensive utility, as its typing allows it to switch in on the likes of Rillaboom, Zygarde, and Urshifu-R, although its poor defenses make this risky. This same bad bulk, alongside its overall poor typing, means Whimsicott has trouble setting Tailwind multiple times, as it struggles to stay in for multiple turns or switch back in after leaving the field. Whimsicott also has difficulty against teams with Psychic Terrain or Tsareena, both of which negate most of its support movepool, bar Tailwind. Finally, Whimsicott faces competition from other Tailwind setters such as Naganadel and Mew. The former possesses powerful offensive pressure, and the latter has a massive support movepool, which includes Fake Out, and fantastic bulk, which makes setting Tailwind multiple times a cinch.</p>",

  "Scrafty": {
    "overview": "<p>Scrafty has a usable role in DOU as a niche Intimidate pivot. Its high Defense and access to Intimidate let it excel at checking certain physical attackers like Zygarde and Dragon Dance Kyurem-B. Fake Out is also important for it, as it can grant teammates like Porygon2 free turns to do whatever they wish. Scrafty is also a decent offensive threat, as STAB Close Combat and Knock Off are considerably threatening to common Pokemon such as Heatran, Kyurem-B, and Mew. This, when combined with its low Speed, allows Scrafty to function as a reliable attacker on Trick Room teams while still providing support for its teammates. However, Scrafty's lower Speed also hurts it from being as effective offensively on teams with Tailwind, albeit its support still being useful. Its mediocre Attack also holds it back offensively, despite its good STAB combination. Scrafty's biggest downside by far is the fact it directly competes with Incineroar as an Intimidate pivot, and while Incineroar lacks STAB Close Combat, it easily makes up for it with access to Parting Shot and a better defensive typing that allows it to handle Fairy-types like Tapu Lele more easily, making Incineroar more useful on the majority of teams. Despite this, Scrafty's better offensive presence under Trick Room, in addition to its typing making it better into Landorus, Kyurem-B, and Volcanion, allows it to maintain a small niche on said Trick Room teams. Pokemon who can reliably set Trick Room, like Porygon2 and Diancie, are essential partners for Scrafty, as they also appreciate the Fake Out and Intimidate support and make good offensive partners for Scrafty.</p>",

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is one of the best support Pokemon in the metagame, capable of redirecting attacks with Rage Powder or putting foes to sleep with Spore. It is bulky enough to live most attacks, and the added survivability from Regenerator allows it to perform its role repeatedly throughout a match. Additionally, Pollen Puff ensures Amoonguss's teammates can also remain healthy. Setup Pokemon, such as Dragon Dance Zygarde or Kyurem-B and Calm Mind Tapu Fini, benefit the most from Amoonguss's support and can make up for its minimal damage output. Due to its low Speed and Spore, Amoonguss also works well both with and against Trick Room teams, as it can then send most Pokemon to sleep before they move. Trick Room users such as Porygon2 and Diancie also appreciate the redirection support while setting it. Despite being able to stomach most hits, Amoonguss must be wary of Fire-types such as Heatran and Incineroar as well as Psychic-types such as Tapu Lele and Necrozma, requiring teammates to deal with them such as Urshifu-R and Heatran, respectively. The presence of Misty Terrain hampers Amoonguss's Spore, so terrain setters such as Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F, or Metagross with Steel Roller, are essential to remove it. Opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom, or Pokemon holding Safety Goggles, can also be troublesome, as immunity to powder moves lets them mostly ignore Amoonguss and attack its partner. Blastoise, its biggest competitor as a redirector, doesn't share this drawback.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Resist berries such as Occa and Papaya allow Amoonguss to live certain attacks that it would not otherwise. Eject Button lets Amoonguss redirect a hit and then immediately switch out, e.g. for helping to set Trick Room or Tailwind and then getting an attacker in to benefit right away. However, Eject Button can be awkward if Amoonguss intends to use Spore and gets forced out instead or needs to redirect two attacks. Another option is Rocky Helmet, which provides chip damage on physical attackers such as Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, and Genesect. These alternate item choices are not as generally useful as the recovery from Sitrus Berry, though. Clear Smog is a weaker Poison-type STAB move compared to Sludge Bomb, but it can be used instead to help deal with opposing setup. A Grass-type STAB move such as Energy Ball could also be considered, but it cannot effectively hit the Pokemon immune to Spore, while the Pokemon it does hit harder than Sludge Bomb are vulnerable to Spore, so there is little reason to use it.</p>",

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn carves itself a place in the metagame due to its unique typing and solid defensive stats, which make it a difficult Pokemon for certain teams to deal with. With Iron Defense, Ferrothorn can survive even the likes of Urshifu-R's Close Combat and Incineroar's Flare Blitz, making it a potent wincon. This is especially true against teams lacking a special Fire-type attack: Ferrothorn's biggest weakness. Body Press can hit most Pokemon that threaten Ferrothorn neutrally or better. Its Grass / Steel typing gives it a plethora of useful resistances, leaving a number of common Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Tapu Fini, and Amoonguss as easy setup opportunities. Fake Out from teammates like Mew and Incineroar can further facilitate setup, with the latter's Intimidate helping against physical attackers too. Ferrothorn benefits greatly from rain to weaken Fire-type attacks and multiple teammates to deal with Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran that threaten it, something that other teammates such as Landorus and Volcanion can also be used for instead. Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 also work well due to Ferrothorn's low Speed and let it KO many would-be checks with a boosted Body Press first. Despite its strengths defensively, Ferrothorn struggles from passivity, being unthreatening without a boost. Compounded by its low Speed, this means Ferrothorn is often a momentum drain, especially against faster paced teams. Compositions with multiple Pokemon that threaten Ferrothorn, such as Naganadel and Dragapult in addition to a Fire-type and potentially Urshifu-R too, are not uncommon and are problematic for it to face.</p>",

  "Volcarona": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcarona carves a place for itself in the DOU metagame as both a niche but effective redirector and a powerful setup sweeper. Volcarona's Fire typing lets it safely redirect Steel- and Ice-type moves, which partners like Kyurem-B and Dragapult appreciate, while access to a strong STAB move in Overheat threatens Grass-types like Rillaboom and Tsareena that ignore Rage Powder. Its excellent base 100 Speed outspeeds most common threats, such as Urshifu-R and Kyurem-B, allowing Volcarona to provide effective speed control with Tailwind. Volcarona's strong supporting toolkit pairs well with aggressive partners that enjoy speed control and redirection such as Landorus and Zygarde. Volcarona can also burn through the opposing team as a setup sweeper thanks to a powerful setup move in Quiver Dance and a STAB spread move in Heat Wave. It is difficult to revenge kill, as it outspeeds almost all relevant Pokemon, even Choice Scarf users, at +1 and resists Grassy Glide. Volcarona struggles to threaten bulky Fire- and Water-types like Incineroar, Heatran, Volcanion, and Tapu Fini; Pokemon like Rillaboom and Zeraora can help provide space for Volcarona to set up by offering Fake Out support and breaking down bulky Water-types, while partners such as Landorus and Urshifu-R can help remove Fire-types. Redirectors such as Indeedee-F, Blastoise, and Amoonguss can help facilitate Volcarona's setup with Follow Me or Rage Powder. Unfortunately, no matter what set it runs, Volcarona is still weak to physical threats like Urshifu-R, Incineroar, and Zygarde. Thanks to its weakness to Rock, Volcarona also folds to Rock-types like Diancie and Nihilego, which can easily stomach any attack from Volcarona and OHKO it in return.

    "overview": "<p>Landorus stands out as the most threatening special attacker in the format. Blessed with Sheer Force and a Ground typing, Landorus decimates many metagame threats such as Incineroar, Diancie, and Metagross, with its outright power significantly chunking even bulky neutral switch-ins like Mew and Porygon2. Its base 101 Speed is just enough to pin down nearly the entire unboosted metagame, letting it get the jump on Mew, Urshifu-R, and Zygarde while only being outrun and threatened by Nihilego, Naganadel, and Dragapult. However, Landorus offers very little defensive utility in disadvantaged positions against opposing speed control, is vulnerable to Ice- and Water-type attacks from the likes of Porygon2 and Tapu Fini, and is relatively frail, leaving it easily OHKOed by the aforementioned three faster threats.

However, its lack of notable resistances is a notable flaw for its role as a pivot, forcing it to rely on its average natural bulk and Intimidate to take hits. It also has debilitating weaknesses to Water and Ice, making it tricky to utilize in matchups against Mew, as well as rain teams and slower teams with Porygon2 and Volcanion while they have Trick Room up. Intimidate's effectiveness is also not so pronounced, as numerous physical attackers in the format, such as Urshifu-R, Diancie, and Metagross, have ways to get around it, though Landorus-T's better match-up against Zygarde is one boon over standard Intimidate user Incineroar.

    "overview": "<p>Kyurem-B is blessed with the combination of solid mixed attacking capabilities, good defensive stats—which make it difficult to remove, a potent boosting option in Dragon Dance, and excellent coverage moves in Fusion Bolt and Earth Power, making it one of the most threatening forces in Doubles OU. It can be used on almost any team due to its universally beneficial combination of offensive pressure and utility, utility both in outright checking threats like Rillaboom and Zygarde and even speed control from Icy Wind. Its monstrously strong Dragon Dance set is also one of the most potent wincons in the tier, especially when paired with Fake Out and redirection support from the likes of Incineroar and Amoonguss, though it struggles against Trick Room Pokemon, particularly Diancie. Unfortunately, Kyurem-B's relatively average Speed tier leaves it outrun by checks like Urshifu-R and Genesect, which can hit it for super effective damage. Additionally, its poor defensive typing leaves it open to multiple powerful fringe attacks such as Galarian Zapdos's Close Combat, Nihilego's Meteor Beam, and Metagross's Steel Roller.</p>",

It can immediately threaten a wide swathe of the tier for super effective damage, including Kyurem-B, Rillaboom, and Zygarde, and many teams appreciate it bringing in setup threats or Pokemon with favorable matchups. It is able to become a potent wincon with Shift Gear, completely dismantling teams that lack study counterplay options such as Heatran, Volcanion, Zapdos, and Urshifu-R. It also has the sustainability that other setup sweepers lack thanks to Leech Life. Unfortunately, not only does Genesect have no way to hit most Fire-types, but its effectiveness plummets when momentum isn't on its side, either due to Fake Out or opposing forms of speed control. This counterplay exposes its meager bulk and 4x Fire weakness while impeding its revenge killing. Lastly, once Choice Scarf Genesect is locked into a move, it becomes a lot easier to play around. Genesect appreciates teammates that threaten Fire-types like Volcanion, Urshifu-R, and Zygarde, while it threatens Kyurem-B, Rillaboom, and Landorus in return.

If running it, be sure to run a Hasty nature instead of Naive. Other items that allow switching moves are Life Orb and Expert Belt, with Expert Belt being less directly effective but avoiding recoil and letting Genesect bluff Choice Scarf. However, all three items leave Genesect slower than threats such as Zapdos, Naganadel, and Dragapult, which makes its life as a pivot much harder. Flash Cannon is an option over Iron Head to for Diancie after it gets some Defense boosts, but does significantly less damage to Assault Vest Kyurem-B, Nihilego, and Tapu Fini.

  "Sylveon": {
    "overview": "<p>While generally outclassed by Tapu Fini as a Calm Mind sweeper, Sylveon boasts a unique advantage in Pixilate + Hyper Voice, which gives it better spread damage than Tapu Fini's Muddy Water thanks to the boost from Pixilate, its better neutral coverage, and Sylveon's higher base Special Attack. This combination lets Sylveon hit Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Kyurem-B, and Rillaboom for strong spread damage, which Tapu Fini isn't able to do with Muddy Water. Unlike Tapu Fini though, Sylveon struggles to damage Steel-types such as Heatran and Celesteela, and it requires teammates like Incineroar, Landorus, or Volcanion to remove Steel-types or chip them into range of a boosted Hyper Voice. Sylveon also doesn't automatically set Misty Terrain to naturally block status moves, and a pure-Fairy typing means Sylveon loses the Water Type's defensive profile, which is compounded by a much lower base 65 Defence stat. It also fails to offer any utility outside of Calm Mind offence, unlike Tapu Fini. Sylveon appreciates support from teammates like Incineroar, Rillaboom, and Zeraora, which ease it setting up Calm Mind with Fake Out. Incineroar also provides damage mitigation through Intimidate and Snarl, and Rillaboom gives HP recovery from Grassy Terrain.

  "Zygarde": {
    "overview": "<p>Boasting great offensive capabilities with Thousand Arrows, a decent defensive typing, and solid bulk to boot, Zygarde sets itself as a premier threat in the metagame. Thousand Arrows is a big draw to Zygarde, as it is one of the best offensive spread moves in the game due hitting Ground-immune Pokemon, making it having no immunities and a lack of resistances on an already great offensive type. Choice Band allows Zygarde to be immediately threatening to teams with instant power, while Dragon Dance turns it into a threatening sweeper. However, both options have issues with being too slow and requiring multiple turns of setup to be threatening, respectively. Redirection support from the likes of Volcarona and Amoonguss as well as Fake Out support from Rillaboom and Zeraora can help alleviate these weaknesses, with the Dragon Dance set in particular appreciating these opportunities to set Substitute and set up. Due to the Zygarde's middling Speed tier and lack of immediate power ,it is easily pressured by the likes of Genesect, Kyurem-B, and Dragapult which outspeed and threaten to OHKO it. Furthermore, Rillaboom, Tapu Fini, and the aforementioned Kyurem-B easily take a hit from Zygarde and can force it back out. Intimidate from both Landorus-T and Incineroar can make Zygarde much easier to deal with defensively. Zygarde also faces stiff competition with Landorus, which boasts much more immediate power and better coverage options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Dance Zygarde can opt for a slightly more offensive set with Soft Sand to further boost Thousand Arrows's power at the cost of losing Leftovers, which in turn makes Substitute harder to pull off. Scale Shot provides Zygarde with a secondary STAB option that can nail Ground-resistant Pokemon and provide a burst of Speed. However, the Defense drop and being forced to drop a potentially more useful coverage option makes it not worth it most of the time. A Sitrus Berry, Yache Berry, and Weakness Policy can all be used on the Dragon Dance set, although the lack of passive recovery forgone when choosing these items over Leftovers makes them an inferior option.</p>",

Offensively, Rock has minimal resistances and hits common Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Incineroar super effectively. While its typing might leave it with four common weaknesses, its outstanding defensive stats mean that it can usually take a hit and activate Weakness Policy. Diancie fits best on semi-Trick Room compositions, where it takes advantage of its low Speed and can set up Trick Room multiple times and start shredding holes in the opponent's team with Diamond Storm, stacking Defense boosts to make it much harder to get rid of. Clear Body also lets it ignore Intimidate, making it very hard to stop once it gets going. Volcanion makes for an excellent partner, as it helps remove Grass- and Steel-types such as Rillaboom and Genesect for Diancie, which in return provides reliable speed control. Rillaboom's Fake Out makes Trick Room easier to set up and its powerful Grass-type STAB moves help against Urshifu-R and Tapu Fini. In return, Diancie takes care of Fire-types and Kyurem-B. Diancie struggles quite a bit outside of Trick Room, where its poor Speed leaves it vulnerable to super effective hits from the likes of Urshifu-R, Rillaboom, Zygarde, and Genesect, the first ignoring any Defense boosts Diancie might accumulate and the second having strong priority to hit first even if Trick Room is active. Diancie is also hard walled by Metagross, and must always worry about its strong Steel-type STAB moves threatening an OHKO. Furthermore, it can struggle to break past bulkier Pokemon such as Tapu Fini and Amoonguss even under Trick Room, the latter of which is able to land Spore freely if Diancie isn't using Safety Goggles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Press can be used over Moonblast to synergize well with Defense boosts from Diamond Storm, but it needs said boosts to be most effective and Diancie then loses out on coverage for Urshifu-R and Zygarde. It also doesn't benefit from any potential Weakness Policy boosts. Play Rough is another alternative to Moonblast that's stronger, but it risks missing and the power difference is typically not needed, especially if Diancie gets the Weakness Policy boost. Babiri, Rindo, Shuca, and Passho Berry are all options to make sure Diancie lives a certain hit on specific teams and Mental Herb can be used to ignore Taunt once, but these items are less useful overall than Weakness Policy or Safety Goggles.</p>",

  "Lurantis": {
    "overview": "<p>Lurantis has a niche as a Trick Room attacker with its low Speed and the capability to snowball damage with the combination of Superpower and Contrary, boosting its Attack and Defense every time it hits. Contrary also gives Lurantis Attack boosts from Intimidate, making opposing Incineroar hesitant to switch in. With Trick Room being essential for Lurantis to be effective, bulky Trick Room setters like Porygon2 and Diancie work great as teammates. Tapu Fini also works well as a partner, as it can set Misty Terrain to prevent Luratis from getting burned by Will-O-Wisp from Mew and checking Fire-types like Heatran. Dragapult, meanwhile, can check some of Lurantis's greatest threats outside of Trick Room, outspeeding and OHKOing Landorus and Naganadel with Draco Meteor when they would otherwise OHKO Lurantis with Sludge Bomb. Lurantis's main downsides are its mediocre stats and need for boosts from Intimidate or Superpower to be particularly threatening—which can make it difficult to justify using over other Pokemon—and reliance on Trick Room. Even with Trick Room active, Amoonguss can move before it and either take away its stat boosts with Clear Smog or do heavy damage with Sludge Bomb.</p>",

It also functions as a solid check to the likes of Rillaboom, Zygarde, and Tapu Fini, threatening all three out, as well as taking away the biggest tools from the first two. Tsareena works best on offensive teams where it can protect Urshifu-R and weakened teammates from getting sniped down from Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, as well as Choice Band Zygarde and Choice Scarf Genesect from getting slowed down by Fake Out. Tsareena's middling Speed tier in conjunction with its mediocre bulk, often relying on an Assault Vest or a Sitrus Berry for longevity, make it extremely vulnerable to the myriad of strong attackers in the tier, such as Heatran and Genesect. Tsareena also faces large competition from the dominant Grass-types of the tier in Rillaboom and Amoonguss, which provide more overall utility in the form of Fake Out and Grassy Surge for the former and redirection and Spore for the latter.</p>",

Tapu Koko is only found on certain hail teams alongside teammates such as Alolan Ninetales, Kyurem-B, and Genesect that can check and threaten Grass- and Ground-types like Zygarde, Landorus, and Rillaboom with Blizzard.

Amoonguss is also a solid partner due to Tapu Lele removing opposing Misty Terrain, which blocks its Spore. However, Tapu Lele is held back by its middling Speed tier, which, while high enough to outspeed threats such as Choice Band Zygarde, is still vulnerable to attackers such as Urshifu-R and Dragapult. It is also generally quite weak due to the prevalence of opposing Terrain control as well as the the lack of a boosting item and significant Special Attack investment. Furthermore, its inability to break through Steel-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Genesect, and Metagross means it needs offensive support from Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Zygarde. Tapu Lele also faces competition from Indeedee-F as a Psychic Terrain setter, which has less offensive prowess but provides much more in terms of support to teams.</p>",

  "Tapu Fini": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Fini is an important asset of balance teams thanks to its defensive and offensive utility, which stems from its typing and ability. A Water / Fairy typing lets it easily take attacks from the likes of Heatran, Urshifu-R, and Volcanion, especially when considering its great natural bulk, which also allows it to take neutral attacks from the likes of Zygarde and Dragapult relatively well. In return, it can threaten the aforementioned Pokemon back with its STAB moves, giving it offensive utility as well. Misty Surge allows Tapu Fini to exert Terrain control, with Misty Terrain removing priority from Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and turning Necrozma's Expanding Force into a single target move. Misty Terrain also has the benefit of blocking Amoonguss's Spore and weakening Dragon-type moves from the likes of Dragapult and Kommo-o. Tapu Fini can take advantage of Pokemon it walls with a Calm Mind set, which lets it function as a dangerous wincon while maintaining its defensive and offensive utility. It can also take on a support role and utilize its great support movepool with moves like Heal Pulse and Nature's Madness. The Calm Mind set can take a bit to get going and relies on Leftovers to keep it healthy, while the support set is mostly passive. Further, both sets have a tendency to be and share a considerable weakness to one of the best Pokemon in the tier, Rillaboom. It threatens Tapu Fini with its powerful STAB Grassy Glide and resets Misty Terrain. Tapu Fini also has a tendency to get overwhelmed and chipped while it switches in to take resisted hits and change the terrain, a problem made worse by its lack of instant recovery. Pokemon that can handle Rillaboom make excellent partners for Tapu Fini. Kyurem-B and Incineroar in particular are great partners, as Tapu Fini beats Urshifu-R for them as well.</p>",

Trick is an option on both sets and can cripple its switch-ins like Rillaboom. However, both items are generally less consistent than the Calm Mind or Support sets.

    "overview": "<p>While Nihilego shines in DOU as a menacing attacker that can quickly turn a game in its favor, it is particularly held back by its one-dimensional nature, lacking coverage, and vulnerability to the tier's various physical threats. Its access to the combination of STAB-boosted Meteor Beam and Beast Boost make it quite dangerous, with the ability to completely dominate the game off a single KO being its main selling point. This is supplemented by its impressive offensive stats, as its base 127 Special Attack is quite high and its Speed allows it to outrun a large swathe of the metagame, only beaten by the likes of Zeraora, Dragapult, and Naganadel. Outside of purely attacking, though, Nihilego can only really utilize its astounding Special Defense to soak some special hits in a pinch; it otherwise offers no team-wide utility whatsoever, which means it's completely useless in opposing speed control, as it wouldn't be able to safely attack. Its paper-thin Defense leaves it prey to the likes of Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, and Zeraora, and it's also completely walled by Zygarde and Metagross. Fake Out and redirection support from Incineroar, Rillaboom, Blastoise, and Amoonguss can be handy in giving it the space to operate, with Incineroar also having Intimidate to hide Nihilego's low Defense, while the likes of Dragapult, Kyurem-B, and Genesect help in making up for Nihilego's lacking coverage. Most glaring, though, is how predictable Nihilego can be, as it practically needs Meteor Beam to be truly threatening, and its set is also essentially telegraphed due to needing both reliable STAB moves and having a lacking movepool.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, used either with Meteor Beam or on a dedicated set with Focus Sash, can give Nihilego the utility it needs to shine in cases where it can't offensively, though they would also exacerbate Nihilego's already existing flaws as an attacker. Dazzling Gleam can be an option to hit Zygarde and Kommo-o as well as for having a spread move to clean with if sufficient Special Attack boosts are accumulated, though neither of Nihilego's STAB moves are easy to give up.

Notably, it boasts the highest unboosted Speed in the metagame, outrunning even the likes of Naganadel, Dragapult, and Zeraora. Pheromosa also possesses a potent STAB combination alongside Ice Beam, both of which come off its high attacking stats—this entire package makes it a predator to the likes of Naganadel, Landorus, Kyurem-B, Rillaboom, Mew, and Heatran, excelling in an all-out attacking role to check fast, offensive team archetypes. Its strong STAB U-turn particularly comes in handy, as it also lets Pheromosa safely break down defensive backbones, and it keeping momentum lets strong offensive teammates maintain pressure, such as Naganadel and Heatran. Still, Pheromosa is ultimately flawed because of its frailty. It essentially cannot come onto the field safely if not a lead or replacing a KOed teammate, though slow pivots such as Incineroar and Rillaboom mitigate this weakness. Pheromosa is also vulnerable to priority attacks, particularly the omnipresent Fake Out, which often forces it to play defensively, though Tsareena, Tapu Lele, and Indeedee-F do alleviate this. Its most glaring weakness, though, is its ineffectiveness when outsped, as even average attackers can OHKO it through its paper-thin defenses. Choice Scarf attackers, such as Urshifu-R and Genesect, and opposing speed control, such as Tailwind or Trick Room, easily invalidate Pheromosa.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>Necrozma is one of the most powerful attackers in Doubles OU, threatening to 2HKO the entire tier with Expanding Force under Psychic Terrain at +1, which it can easily get to with the combination of Power Herb and Meteor Beam. With many common Psychic-resistant and -immune Pokemon in the metagame such as Heatran and Incineroar folding to its coverage options like Earth Power and Meteor Beam, Necrozma can easily plow through teams once if it gets the necessary support. It fits best of on hyper offense builds where the goal is to win games in as few turns as possible. Psychic Terrain support, which powers up Expanding Force and blocks priority, is critical to Necrozma's success, making either Tapu Lele or Indeedee-F mandatory teammates. Pokemon that can break through Steel- and Dark-types such as Urshifu-R and Heatran also make excellent partners, enabling Necrozma to keep using Expanding Force without worry. While Necrozma can end games once it gets going, it can be slowed down in multiple ways. Rillaboom and Tapu Fini can reliably switch in multiple times and reset Terrain, which heavily weakens Expanding Force, with the former also threatening Necrozma with Fake Out. Opposing Tailwind setters such as Zapdos and Mew also work well against it, as well as other forms of speed control users such as Icy Wind Kyurem-B and Trick Room Diancie. Additionally, while Pokemon such as Incineroar, Heatran, and Metagross must fear Necrozma's coverage, they can all switch into Expanding Force and slow it down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trick Room gives Necrozma a way to control its own Speed and decide the pace of the game, but it comes at the cost of valuable coverage. Weakness Policy is another way to boost that has a bigger payoff, but it's less reliable and Necrozma loses the one-time Meteor Beam nuke. Heat Wave is an alternative coverage option that's better against Genesect, but it is generally inferior to Earth Power's ability to hit Heatran and Incineroar. Stealth Rock can be used to secure chip damage on incoming foes, notably Incineroar, but it can be a momentum loss to uses and Necrozma prefers using its coverage to take down its foes.</p>",

Naganadel's Tailwind utility is appreciated on many structures, but shines brightest on offensive archetypes where teammates such as Heatran, Zygarde, and Urshifu-R can get an immediate Speed boost and start firing off strong attacks. Naganadel appreciates all three of these Pokemon's ability to deal with Heatran and other Steel-types, while in return Naganadel deals with Tapu Fini as well as Rillaboom for the latter two. However, Naganadel is completely useless into Heatran, and its frailty leaves it susceptible to being KOed early, therefore limiting its potential to set up multiple Tailwinds. It also struggles into opposing forms of speed control, especially Trick Room, and usually can't fit Protect in its repertoire due to it wanting all 3 of its attacks and Tailwind. Its inability to fit Protect and bad matchup against opposing speed control expose its poor bulk even more, while also meaning it cannot block the everpresent Fake Out and instead must rely only on its partner keeping it safe. Lastly, Naganadel is heavily prediction reliant as failing to get KOs puts it in danger.</p>",

  "Stakataka": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to its high Attack, low Speed, and strong Gyro Ball, Stakataka is a solid offensive Trick Room setter in DOU. The combination of its good Defense and Rock / Steel typing gives Stakataka good defensive utility; it is able to reliably switch in against some of the tier's most threatening attackers such as Dragon Dance Kyurem-B and Celesteela while acting as an effective check to Naganadel. Because of Stakataka's ability, Beast Boost, it can very quickly snowball and become difficult to handle. Its nuclear Gyro Ball can OHKO Diancie and Kyurem-B in addition to dealing good damage to neutral targets like Tapu Fini and Rillaboom. However, if Trick Room is denied via Fake Out, Taunt, Spore, or any other means, Stakataka has a hard time posing an offensive threat due to its incredibly low Speed. Because its typing leaves it vulnerable to notable special attackers such as Volcanion, Tapu Fini, and Heatran, Stakataka partners well with Fake Out users such as Incineroar and Pokemon with redirection moves such as Amoonguss to help alleviate these weaknesses. It also works well with more consistent Trick Room setters such as Porygon2 and Cresselia. Most importantly, Stakataka has direct competition from fellow Rock-type Diancie as an offensive Trick Room setter; Diancie is generally more reliable, as it has better defensive capabilities, is immune to the effects of Intimidate, and has access to a strong spread move in Diamond Storm, granting it snowballing potential.</p>",

High Horsepower and Heat Crash give Stakataka a more reliable way of dealing with Pokemon it would ordinarily do poorly against, as High Horsepower allows Stakataka to OHKO Heatran and 2HKO Metagross, while Heat Crash allows Stakataka to OHKO Amoonguss and Ferrothorn. However, both moves have limited applications outside of hitting those select Pokemon, and require Stakataka to forsake its Rock-type STAB or Protect to use them. Safety Goggles can also be used to match up better into Amoonguss without limiting Stakataka's coverage options at the cost of losing out on the extra power provided by Life Orb.</p>",

  "Zeraora": {
    "overview": "<p>Zeraora uses its speed and access to valuable utility moves to support a variety of different teamstyles, from balance to hyper offense, by acting as a solid offensive pivot. Fake Out is always valuable, and Zeraora also can threaten the Ghost-types like Dragapult that are immune to it with a faster Knock Off. Being the fastest Pokemon in the tier is one of Zeraora's most helpful traits, especially benefitting Fake Out and Taunt. Zeraora's bulk isn't stellar, but when combined with an immunity to Electric, two resistances, and only one weakness, it's generally sufficient to pivot throughout the battle. Grass-types like Rillaboom, Amoonguss, and Tsareena can cause problems for Zeraora, so Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona are solid teammates, and they also appreciate Zeraora's ability to threaten Water-type foes. Zeraora also needs help handling Zygarde and other Ground-type enemies, so Kyurem-B is another solid option, and it also helps with those Grass-types. Although Zeraora's utility moves can be valuable in many situations, if one of those situations isn't currently happening, then it can be a bit of a momentum sink, struggling to scare many popular threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Coaching offers external setup to physical attackers like Zygarde, Shift Gear Genesect, and Dragon Dance Kyurem-B, but it must replace Taunt or Knock Off, and not every team can afford to make the switch. If Zeraora drops Knock Off, then it can also shift the 252 Attack EVs to HP for a significant boost in bulk, since investing so heavily in Attack for only one significant attack is inefficient. An Assault Vest allows Zeraora to sit in on foes it is meant to beat like Tapu Fini and Zapdos a bit more reliably; however, this forces it to drop Taunt in favor of another attacking move, which typically is one of three options. Volt Switch offers fast pivoting that can also deal okay damage, Electroweb gives fast, spread speed control to support middling-Speed wallbreakers, and Snarl expands upon the special bulk provided by Assault Vest while annoying special attackers. For a more offensive take on Zeraora, it can use a Life Orb and drop Fake Out in favor of Protect. Close Combat often finds its way onto such sets, as it hits Kyurem-B super effectively as well as Incineroar and Porygon2. Using an Adamant nature is a different way to get a bit more power, notably increasing the chance to KO Urshifu-R with Plasma Fists. This misses out on outrunning Dragapult and Spectrier and Speed tying with opposing Zeraora, but teams with adequate answers for these foes can get away with it. Equipping a Magnet guarantees the Plasma Fists OHKO on Urshifu-R without changing the makeup of Zeraora's standard set, but this is the only benchmark it enables.</p>",

Grassy Glide is given priority and boosted by Grassy Terrain, letting Rillaboom soft check a wide variety of threats regardless of Speed, such as boosted Dragon Dance Zygarde and Diancie under Trick Room, as well as picking off any Pokemon low on health. Rillaboom works well on a variety of team archetypes thanks to the sheer utility it provides. For example, structures that rely on Trick Room or setup appreciate Rillaboom’s ability to create safe turns through the use of Fake Out, while the latter also appreciates Grassy Terrain's passive healing to keep wincons healthy. Volcanion and Urshifu-R synergize well with Rillaboom, as they remove Fire-types and Kyurem-B, respectively, and in return, Rillaboom checks Water-types such as Tapu Fini. Rillaboom is not without faults, though; its Grass typing leaves it with a plethora of weaknesses that are exposed by common Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Genesect, and it can be tricky to use alongside other Terrain setters. It's also worn down quickly by pivoting in and out, especially with entry hazards up, as it typically has no recovery besides Grassy Terrain and doesn't carry Protect, leaving it open to being attacked every turn and susceptible to double targets.</p>",

Knock Off is also available to hit Dragapult, but all three alternatives mean missing out on your most powerful STAB attack.

If Necrozma is not on the same team, though, then Indeedee-F is generally a poor pick; as a redirector, Indeedee-F pales in comparison to Blastoise and Amoonguss with regard to defensive stats, typing, and utility, and as a Psychic Terrain setter, Tapu Lele's monstrous strength and overall better stats will be more useful. Even within Psychic spam teams, Indeedee-F's lack of offensive presence compared to Tapu Lele can be quite exploitable, with Tapu Lele's ability to check Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Kyurem-B possibly being missed, and Indeedee-F's redirection niche is still replaceable by Amoonguss.

Dracozolt stands as one of sand's better answers to Water-types, such as Volcanion, Tapu Fini, and Urshifu-R, as it is decently capable of switching in on their Water-type attacks and threatens to KO them back—a niche over its main competition in Dracovish. Dracozolt's biggest downfall, however, lies in its reliance on Bolt Beak to be useful. While its Electric typing does let Dracozolt beat some key threats, it's also easily answered by too many popular Pokemon in the metagame, such as Rillaboom, Amoonguss, Landorus, Zeraora, Zygarde, and Assault Vest Kyurem-B. Bolt Beak's conditionality, which also effectively makes Tyranitar a compulsory teammate, is also easily circumvented by speed control such as Tailwind and Trick Room, and without Bolt Beak's doubled power, Dracozolt is simply mediocre due to its actually paltry offensive base stats. Ultimately, Dracozolt can be hard to fit onto sand teams because of the stiff competition among Sand Rush attackers and how having multiple together puts too much pressure on Tyranitar.

  "Dracovish": {
    "overview": "<p>This prehistoric fish wreaks havoc as a powerful attacker on sand teams! Its access to Fishious Rend allows it to heavily damage most of the tier as long as it's moving first, which Sand Rush makes significantly easier, allowing it to outspeed the entire tier under sand. Dracovish also has a decent defensive typing for an attacker of its caliber, able to switch in on attackers like Heatran and Metagross and survive a hit. However, Dracovish struggles to break past common Pokemon that resist Fishious Rend, mainly Rillaboom, which 2HKOes it while weakening Fishious Rend with priority Grassy Glide, and Tapu Fini and Kyurem-B, both which threaten to OHKO or 2HKO Dracovish after minimal chip damage. Volcanion can ignore Dracovish locked into Fishious Rend entirely with Water Absorb, either attempting to burn Dracovish or attacking its partner. In addition, Dracovish heavily relies on sand to maintain a strong offensive presence, as its damage is utterly mediocre if it's outsped, which also means opposing speed control like Tailwind or Trick Room is bad for it. Its Attack is also low, making all non-Fishious Rend attacks relatively weak. Tyranitar is a near mandatory partner due to it not only setting sand, but also easily beating Kyurem-B. Incineroar and Rillaboom handle opposing Rillaboom and Tapu Fini, respectively, and Incineroar is yet another Kyurem-B check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Slide can be used as hit both foes as well as giving Dracovish another option to hit Kyurem-B and Volcanion, but it is pathetically weak. Dracovish can use Mystic Water to boost Fishious Rend while being able to switch moves and use Protect. However, it loses out on a significant amount of power compared to Choice Band and only boosts Fishious Rend. While a set using Choice Scarf and Strong Jaw can technically exist, its damage and Speed are exponentially worse, and it still suffers from the same drawbacks as Choice Band, just without the need for sand support.</p>",

  "Dragapult": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragapult is useful on a wide variety of teams for its great typing and Speed. Its Dragon / Ghost typing lets it switch into Pokemon like Urshifu-R, and Heatran. It's also a great offensive typing, as Ghost-type moves are virtually unresisted in the metagame bar Pokemon like Incineroar and Porygon2, and Dragon-type moves hit many important targets like Kyurem-B and Zygarde. Its Speed allows it to outpace the vast majority of the unboosted metagame. These qualities allow it to handle many great Pokemon like Urshifu-R, and Zygarde, along with other Pokemon like Rillaboom and Necrozma. Its Choice Specs set can apply pressure instantly, while conversely, its Dragon Dance set can end a game outright if given the freedom to set up. However, Dragapult is heavily relies on its Speed, and its lack of bulk can give it trouble with speed control and switching in. Both sets can also feel underwhelming at times, as the Choice Specs set has to make use of Dragapult's mere base 100 Special Attack, while the Dragon Dance set is reliant on getting boosts to become threatening and lacks reliable STAB moves. As a result, it can struggle to break bulkier Pokemon like Porygon2 and Amoonguss, and it falls easily to faster attackers like Choice Scarf Genesect, Pheromosa, and Dragon Dance-boosted Kyurem-B. Dragapult also loathes Tapu Fini, as Misty Terrain severely limits Dragapult's offensive pressure, and Tapu Fini can OHKO it after minimal chip. This weakness to Tapu Fini makes Rillaboom a prime partner for the drake; Rillaboom can change the Terrain and provide openings for Dragapult to set up via Fake Out. Blastoise is a good partner for the Dragon Dance set, as it packs both Fake Out and Follow Me. Diancie is also another good partner for Dragapult, as it handles Kyurem-B and Incineroar well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Fang is an option over Life Orb on the Dragon Dance set, as it boosts Dragapult's main source of damage without the recoil, but is significantly weaker. Thunderbolt can be run in the fourth slot to hit Water- and Flying-types like Tapu Fini and Galarian Moltres. While it does 2HKO Tapu Fini, it is generally an inferior option to U-turn or Hydro Pump.</p>",

  "Urshifu-Rapid-Strike": {
    "overview": "<p>Urshifu-R is one of the most threatening offensive Pokemon in Doubles, possessing a monstrous base 130 Attack, a great offensive typing, and the unique ability to bypass most traditional defensive counterplay such as Intimidate, Protect, and Defense boosting thanks to the combination of Unseen Fist ignoring protection and Surging Strikes's guaranteed critical hits. This makes it one of the strongest candidates to answer metagame staples like Kyurem-B, Incineroar, Porygon2, and Diancie. Due to Urshifu-R's excellent offensive prowess, defensive answers are limited to mainly just Amoonguss and Tapu Fini, two Pokemon that resist all of its STAB attacks. Instead, it is often answered offensively by the likes of Rillaboom, Dragapult, and Necrozma. Urshifu-R is held back by a fairly middling Speed tier, meaning pairing it with speed control and priority will be very helpful. As such, Zapdos and Naganadel are excellent partners, providing Tailwind support and a way to match up well against Water-types. Other examples of good teammates include Tapu Lele and Indeedee-F for providing Psychic Terrain, which keeps Urshifu-R safe from priority moves like Fake Out and Grassy Glide, and Heatran, which is excellent for hitting Grass-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band allows Urshifu-R to make the most out of its offensive potential, notably scoring the OHKO on physically defensive Porygon2, which Life Orb sets cannot. Urshifu-R can outrun the entire unboosted metagame with a Choice Scarf; however, this comes at a significant decrease in power, as it loses its ability to OHKO Porygon2 and Genesect. U-turn is a decently hard-hitting move that is an option over Protect on Choice Band or Choice Scarf sets that allows Urshifu-R to pivot out of unfavorable situations. This can be especially useful for the opposing Grass-types it baits in, letting it switch out to proper checks. An Adamant nature can be used to deal even more damage, but runs the risk of being outsped by Jolly Kyurem-B, Timid Tapu Lele, and opposing Urshifu-R.</p>",

  "Regieleki": {
    "overview": "<p>While Regieleki is mostly a terrible Pokemon in DOU, it does have an incredibly minor niche as a workable hyper offense attacker alongisde Tapu Koko. Boasting a blazing base 200 Speed that lets it outrun even Kingdra under rain and Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R and Genesect, Regieleki blitzes through opposing offensive teams if enabled with Electric Terrain, as Regieleki's Transistor-boosted STAB attacks become quite lethal even to bulky and resistant foes, with Rising Voltage able to OHKO Incineroar, Dragapult, Mew, and Naganadel. The problem, of course, is how Regieleki is easily checked defensively as it has absolutely no usable coverage moves, leaving it easily answered by Zeraora, Ground-types, such as Zygarde and Landorus, and the metagame's bulky Grass- and Dragon-types, such as Rillaboom, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Kyurem-B. Urshifu-R and Kyurem-B are thus solid partners, as they can each cover some of these threats while also being strong attackers in line with Regieleki's aggressive playstyle. Still, the pairing with Tapu Koko is optimistic at best, because Tapu Koko is generally also a suboptimal pick in the DOU metagame, and other Terrain setters are quite omnipresent, especially with a top DOU Pokemon in Rillaboom being a particularly hard counter. Regieleki is ultimately often dead weight, its high Speed invalidated and frailty exposed by the prevalence of Fake Out and priority moves, speed control such as Tailwind and Trick Room, and its own inability to threaten anything with a non-Electric-type attack.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The writer cannot actively recommend a different Regieleki set without harboring feelings of severe guilt, so please consider this section empty.

It has great base Special Attack and Speed stats, OHKOing targets like Mew and outrunning threats such as Landorus and Naganadel, along with a STAB Shadow Ball for excellent neutral coverage. After a Nasty Plot boost, Spectrier is difficult to slow down due to Grim Neigh making it stronger with each KO, along with a Fake Out immunity. Tools that help Spectrier set up, such as Fake Out and redirection from Pokemon like Zeraora, Blastoise, and Amoonguss, are excellent, as is Urshifu-R, which beats the Dark- and Normal-types, like Incineroar and Porygon2, that are immune or resistant to Shadow Ball. However, without a boost, Spectrier can struggle to break past bulkier Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Incineroar, the latter of which doesn't fear Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball is also its only good attack, which exacerbates the issue of needing a boost to snowball and be optimally effective. Spectrier also has issues setting up a Nasty Plot, due to the being frail enough to fear spread damage even when given redirection, and Life Orb recoil leaves it vulnerable to priority moves such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. To top it all off, Spectrier relies heavily on its Speed, which makes it weak to opposing Tailwind or Trick Room, while also being threatened by the two Pokemon naturally faster than it, Zeraora and Dragapult. Trick Room teams in particular are a huge headache due to Porygon2, one of the best Spectrier answers, being a mainstay on those teams.</p>",

However, to use any of these moves, Spectrier must give up Mud Shot, rendering it unable to hit Incineroar. Hyper Beam is an option that can hit both Incineroar and Porygon2, but it has the devastating drawback of making Spectrier unable to act for a turn.
