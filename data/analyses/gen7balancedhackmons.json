  "Beedrill-Mega": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its blazing Speed and impressive Attack, Mega Beedrill is able to pressure two of the best offensive threats in the metagame, Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y. STAB U-turn allows it to serve as one of the fastest offensive pivots in the game, which can help keep momentum away from the opposing team. Mega Beedrill's secondary Poison typing lets it resist Fairy-type attacks and absorb Toxic Spikes, setting it apart from other Bug-types like Pheromosa. However, Mega Beedrill faces competition as a speedy Bug-type pivot with Pheromosa, which is faster than Pokemon that outspeed Mega Beedrill like Mega Aerodactyl and Deoxys-A, and while Pheromosa is slightly weaker physically, its Fighting-type STAB helps it pressure Steel-types that normally wall Mega Beedrill. Nevertheless, its higher Attack stat gives Mega Beedrill better chances to net OHKOs on foes such as positive Defense-nature Zygarde-C and neutral-natured Arceus. Its Fairy-type resistance is useful, as it allows Mega Beedrill to revenge kill Pixilate Mega Diancie as long as Mega Beedrill has over roughly 50% of its health, and its ability Tough Claws lets it choose from a wide array of useful coverage moves, effectively letting it decide what walls it. Powerful coverage moves like V-create also allow Mega Beedrill to revenge kill threats like Mega Gengar. However, Mega Beedrill's typing also means it is worn down quickly by entry hazards due to its Stealth Rock weakness and Spikes vulnerability; this is important, since its role as a pivot means it will be switching in frequently. Mega Beedrill's primary STAB move, U-turn, is resisted by common defensive types in Ghost, Steel, and Fairy, which are found on prominent Pokemon like Giratina, Registeel, and Xerneas. While Mega Beedrill has a decent defensive typing, it has paper-thin defensive stats and struggles to take even resisted hits, which makes it very easy for it to be revenge killed by priority attacks, like Extreme Speed and Triage Oblivion Wing, or worn down by neutral hits from walls.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Beedrill can bypass some Pokemon that resist its STAB combination by running Tinted Lens, either with a Choice Band set that uses similar coverage moves as Tough Claws or with a sweeper set that uses Swords Dance / Megahorn / Gunk Shot / Sunsteel Strike and Buginium Z. The Choice Band set doubles the damage from U-turn against common switch-ins like Giratina and Registeel, potentially making it easier for teammates to break through them. However, Tinted Lens no longer guarantees some of the OHKOs that Tough Claws picks up, like on Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar, and so is ultimately not as effective. After a Swords Dance boost, the sweeper set can net OHKOs on Registeel and Giratina with Savage Spin-Out. However, this set's main attacks are fairly inaccurate, and the walls it aims to beat are commonly seen with Prankster Haze. The sweeper set offers more firepower than the Choice Band Tinted Lens pivot set at the cost of being a momentum drain if Mega Beedrill is forced out.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Bug and Poison</strong>: Mega Beedrill is walled and forced out by Ghost- and Steel-types, which resist or are immune to both of its STAB moves. Giratina is very common and has impressive physical bulk to help it wall Mega Beedrill, although Mega Beedrill can give Giratina trouble with the right coverage moves. Flash Fire Steel-types wall V-create sets but can be susceptible to other coverage options like Close Combat and Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks and Faster Threats</strong>: Mega Beedrill has very poor defenses and can easily be revenge killed by priority from -ate users like Kyurem-B and Zekrom, Life Orb Triage Oblivion Wing users like Yveltal and Mega Charizard Y, and even Sucker Punch users like Mega Tyranitar. Faster threats like Mega Aerodactyl and Deoxys-A also outspeed and threaten to OHKO Mega Beedrill with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Rocky Helmet</strong>: Mega Beedrill is weak to Stealth Rock and affected by Spikes; damage from these entry hazards can quickly wear down Mega Beedrill and keep it from performing its role. Since all of its moves make contact, Rocky Helmet also chips away at Mega Beedrill and limits how much it can come in as a pivot.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Mega Beedrill is severely crippled by burns and paralysis. Moves like Prankster Will-O-Wisp, Beak Blast, and Nuzzle make it practically useless.</p>",

      "Choice Band Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is Mega Beedrill's most spammable move and helps it to be an effective pivot, notably OHKOing Mega Mewtwo Y from full health. Poison Jab is secondary STAB coverage to nail Mega Audino and Xerneas and also has a chance to poison walls like Giratina and Zygarde-C. Sunsteel Strike is an alternative coverage move that allows Mega Beedrill to eliminate Sturdy Shedinja and Mega Diancie while still hitting other Fairy-types. Bolt Strike is a helpful coverage option for hitting defensive threats that 4x resist U-turn, such as Flash Fire Celesteela and Ho-Oh. Ice Hammer is Mega Beedrill's best option for hitting Dragon-types like Giratina and Zygarde-C, which would otherwise wall it. V-create hits non-Flash Fire Steel-types extremely hard and also OHKOes Eviolite Imposter Chansey. Close Combat is an alternative that allows Mega Beedrill to hit Flash Fire Steel-types as well as Normal-types like Arceus, Chansey, and Regigigas, while Spectral Thief OHKOes Mega Gengar and 2HKOes Giratina and Aegislash but leaves Mega Beedrill walled by Zygarde-C. Dragon Ascent is an option that guarantees OHKOs on Mega Mewtwo X and Choice Scarf Imposter users. Pursuit is a niche option that has a chance to OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y and always OHKOes Mega Gengar as they switch out. However, Pursuit introduces a risky mind game, as Mega Beedrill does not OHKO either Pokemon if they don't switch out and will either be OHKOed or lose momentum in return. High Horsepower is another niche option that allows Mega Beedrill to hit Flash Fire Steel-types that are immune or neutral to Close Combat, like Aegislash and Magearna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band maximizes Mega Beedrill's damage output and ensures that it OHKOes Mega Mewtwo Y from full health with Tough Claws-boosted U-turn. Tough Claws boosts Mega Beedrill's overall offensive prowess, since all of its moves make contact. A Jolly nature is used so that Mega Beedrill outspeeds Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Gengar, and Mega Mewtwo Y and Speed ties with Mega Sceptile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>To keep Mega Beedrill healthy, it is best to send it out when entry hazards have been cleared. U-turn should be used as the primary move for Mega Beedrill to be most effective as an offensive pivot and to help it rack up useful chip damage. Even resisted hits can provide valuable chip damage on walls, making it easier for teammates to take them down later. Using U-turn also keeps momentum away from the opponent and ensures that Mega Beedrill is not locked into a move in unideal situations. Spamming U-turn gives you the opportunity to scout the opponent's switch-in to Mega Beedrill, whether it is Giratina, Zygarde-C, Registeel, or another defensive Pokemon, and scout for abilities that could potentially give Mega Beedrill trouble, such as Fur Coat by assessing how much damage was done or Flash Fire by pivoting into an Imposter teammate. Coverage moves should be used only once sufficient scouting has been performed so that Mega Beedrill's set is not revealed beforehand. Depending on the opponent's switch-in, coverage moves should only be used once the opposing Pokemon is in range of being KOed so as to avoid losing momentum against threats like Prankster + Strength Sap Giratina.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that can keep entry hazards off the field, whether via Magic Bounce or Defog support, help to keep Mega Beedrill healthy. Potential Magic Bounce teammates include Giratina and Mega Audino, and depending on the coverage moves of choice, these teammates can help Imposter-proof Mega Beedrill. Due to Mega Beedrill's type weaknesses like Flying and Psychic and vulnerability to priority attacks, Steel-types pair nicely as teammates, especially if they have Flash Fire to remove their one shared weakness with Mega Beedrill. Potential Steel-type teammates include Flash Fire Registeel and Necrozma-DM to handle -ate users, as well as Prankster Registeel and Aegislash to deal with setup threats. Steel-types can also help Imposter-proof Mega Beedrill based on the coverage options that are used, and the aforementioned ones can also serve as slow pivots that give Mega Beedrill opportunities to come in safely. Offensive teammates that pressure Giratina and Steel-types are beneficial for maintaining momentum. Mega Gengar is a nice option, since it threatens Giratina, Shedinja, and Steel-types that give Mega Beedrill trouble. In return, Mega Beedrill threatens Mega Mewtwo Y, which frees up opportunities for Mega Gengar to sweep. Other examples of teammates include Pixilate Mega Diancie and various Mega Mewtwo X sets, like Tough Claws and Adaptability. Imposter users can help scout opposing sets to check for moves or abilities that could be used to threaten or wall Mega Beedrill such as Triage Oblivion Wing and Fur Coat. Entry hazard support from teammates such as Mega Diancie or Mega Mewtwo X can chip down common switch-ins like Giratina and Registeel and get them in range of being KOed.</p>"

  "Gengar-Mega": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gengar threatens common defensive Pokemon like Giratina and Mega Audino with its STAB combination and effectively uses setup moves and Entrainment + Normalize sets to further pressure its slower checks. It notably can take advantage of its typing and use Spooky Plate in tandem with Judgment to not only fire off strong attacks but also have an advantageous matchup against Imposter Chansey, differentiating itself from most offensive threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Diancie, as they struggle to defeat their Imposter one-on-one. This also means that Mega Gengar will not require the use of another team slot to fit in a Pokemon that has to Imposter-proof it and thus has a somewhat easier time securing its place in many teams. Mega Gengar can utilize its Ghost typing to check Sturdy Shedinja with Mold Breaker if desperately needed. Its Poison typing also leaves Mega Gengar as one of the very few offensive threats that can absorb Toxic Spikes, which sees situational use. High Speed also enables it to offensively check Mega Diancie, whose Pixilate-boosted attacks only deal resisted damage, and Kartana under the right conditions. However, the popularity of Revelation Dance and Magic Bounce from Pokemon like Primal Kyogre and Yveltal tends to somewhat limit Mega Gengar's ability to take advantage of slower foes with Normalize sets. In addition, Mega Gengar's pitiful bulk limits its offensive capabilities as a sweeper due to a prevalence of priority users like Kyurem-B and Triage Yveltal. Mega Gengar also has a very crowded moveset as an offensive threat, meaning it will be shut down by various walls depending on what foes it decides to prepare for; to specify, Normalize sets, which do not use Poison-type attacks, are easily checked by Magic Bounce Mega Audino, forgoing Secret Sword makes Mega Tyranitar impossible to surmount, and any set lacking Tail Glow, Mold Breaker, or niche coverage moves like Moonblast or Ice Beam has little chance against Yveltal. Lastly, Mega Gengar faces a slight competition from Mega Mewtwo Y as a fast special attacker, as Mega Mewtwo Y is more multi dimensional, has slightly greater bulk and higher Special Attack and Speed stats, and is less vulnerable to the extremely common Knock Off and Spectral Thief.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set running Adaptability with Moongeist Beam, Sludge Bomb, Volt Switch, and Trick or Ice Beam is an interesting option due to its more immediate damage output, but the lower Base Power of the STAB moves and the fact that Choice-locked Mega Gengar is very exploitable due to the presence of Pokemon immune to its STAB moves leaves this option outclassed by Mega Mewtwo Y. A Choice Scarf set can similarly be run to surprise faster Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo Y, but the lack of power may be disappointing. Ice Beam and Moonblast are alternative coverage options; Ice Beam solves problems with Zygarde-C and hits Yveltal hard, while Moonblast enables Mega Gengar to hit Yveltal while having a way to hit Mega Gyarados for considerable damage, but they have worse coverage against the majority of the metagame. Ice Beam also struggles to find its place in sets other than Choice Specs, and Moonblast's lower damage output against Mega Tyranitar and inability to threaten Chansey make it an inferior option compared to Secret Sword. As the fastest Ghost-type, Mega Gengar can effectively run a suicide lead set in offensive teams with Mold Breaker to prevent any form of entry hazard removal. This set commonly runs Curse, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Taunt and also has a merit of being difficult to anticipate than other suicide leads like Deoxys-S, as this set can't be predicted well in Team Preview and before Mega Gengar reveals its moves. Perish Song can be employed by the Normalize set with Anchor Shot to trap and remove a foe, and this can be done easily once a foe gains Normalize and cannot damage Mega Gengar. However, many defensive foes can circumvent this set with moves like Parting Shot and Baton Pass and Pokemon like Zygarde-C can still hit Mega Gengar if their Z-Move is available. Overall, this set suffers from the inability to do anything notable to foes that conventionally check Normalize Mega Gengar. Mega Gengar can also use Skill Swap over Entrainment to give foes Normalize to cripple Magic Bounce users, but Mega Gengar can neutralize a foe only once this way until it switches out. With dedicated team support, Mega Gengar can utilize No Guard and Merciless. However, Toxic Spikes is quite difficult to be used successfully due to the prevalence of Magic Bounce users and Imposter Chansey possibly mimicking the strategy, and the damage output is quite inconsistent with moves like Hex and Venoshock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Unlike other Dark-types, Yveltal can viably run Revelation Dance and takes neutral damage from Secret Sword. Thus, it is able to check almost every variant of Mega Gengar when healthy, though it may be overwhelmed by Tail Glow-boosted attacks. Normalize Mega Gengar can also overpower Yveltal with Shell Smash-boosted Boombursts after Stealth Rock damage. Assault Vest and Unaware variants avoid concerns about boosted Mega Gengar if it lacks sleep-inducing moves and effectively handle Mega Gengar.</p> <p><strong>RegenVest Walls</strong>: RegenVest users tend to struggle against Normalize Mega Gengar if lacking Revelation Dance, but Pokemon like Primal Kyogre and Dialga can defensively check setup variants of Mega Gengar. They are particularly hard to wear down due to their ability, and Mega Gengar is forced to rely on excessive prior damage or multiple layers of hazards to surmount them. However, all of them are neutralized by Spore and Entrainment and will struggle to immediately take down Mega Gengar using Quiver Dance. Some of the RegenVest walls like Dialga are vulnerable to boosted Secret Sword as well.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Although it does not resist Judgment, Primal Kyogre's massive special bulk allows it to tank boosted hits when running a RegenVest or Unaware set. A majority of Primal Kyogre variants also run Revelation Dance, meaning it is a good blanket check to Normalize variants as well. Note that Primal Kyogre lacking Spectral Thief will struggle to check Mega Gengar running Quiver Dance due to the Special Defense boost.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Priority users like Refrigerate Kyurem-B, Refrigerate Mega Mewtwo X, and Triage Mega Charizard Y can easily revenge kill Mega Gengar lacking Dazzling or Queenly Majesty by using Fake Out and Extreme Speed, bypassing its high Speed. Although they dislike switching into Judgment, they can take out any variant of Mega Gengar after Stealth Rock damage. Though King's Shield remedies issues with -ate to a degree, the move itself is quite difficult to fit in the first place and Triage Mega Charizard Y can still revenge kill Mega Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Chansey</strong>: Chansey's enormous special bulk makes it a strong check to Mega Gengar, shutting down sweep attempts unless Mega Gengar is overly lucky with sleep turns or has a combination of Mold Breaker and Secret Sword.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce and Comatose Users</strong>: Foes with Magic Bounce or Comatose such as Zygarde-C and Registeel cannot have their abilities removed by Entrainment and can check Mega Gengar, given they can handle Judgment. They can also harshly punish Mega Gengar by bouncing back Spore from setup variants, if Mega Gengar lacks Mold Breaker.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Faster threats like Mega Mewtwo Y can easily outspeed and KO Mega Gengar, though they will be KOed back if Mega Gengar has Focus Sash and cannot take on Mega Gengar if it is boosted by Shell Smash and Quiver Dance.</p> <p><strong>Poison Heal Regigigas</strong>: Regigigas has enough bulk to survive a +2 Secret Sword from Shell Smash Mega Gengar from full health and can OHKO back with Knock Off or Spectral Thief. It can also shut down Normalize Mega Gengar with a sleep move, which it commonly carries.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Mega Gengar's tendency to retreat from bulky Dark-types like Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar due to its frailty and resulting hazardous matchup against them, depending on its moveset, makes Pursuit one of the viable methods to guarantee its removal or at least leave it heavily damaged. They may struggle trapping Normalize variants, but they can also use Trick to throw a wrench in the matchup and cripple Mega Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Knock Off not only hits Mega Gengar super effectively but also removes Spooky Plate, leaving Mega Gengar nearly useless and unable to take on its own Imposter. Trick and Switcheroo can also cripple Mega Gengar by removing Spooky Plate.</p> <p><strong>Z-Moves</strong>: Since Z-Moves bypass Normalize, Pokemon like Prankster Zygarde-C can choose to run one, like Tectonic Rage in Zygarde-C's case, so they can lure in and KO Normalize Mega Gengar. However, Z-Moves are single use only, meaning Mega Gengar can scout them.</p>",

      "Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash sharply boosts Mega Gengar's Special Attack, giving it enough power to OHKO checks like Yveltal and Mega Audino after some prior damage and 2HKO bulky Pokemon like Registeel. Tail Glow, on the other hand, drastically boosts Mega Gengar's Special Attack without lowering its bulk, allowing Mega Gengar to OHKO Yveltal with +3 Sludge Bomb after Stealth Rock damage and guaranteeing OHKOs on Regigigas, Registeel, Mega Gyarados, and Dialga with +3 Secret Sword. Tail Glow's lack of a boost in Speed makes Shell Smash generally a better option, however. Judgment is Mega Gengar's strongest attack and lets it Imposter-proof itself. Judgment's high damage output forces out Ghost-types like Giratina and Aegislash, as they are OHKOed with or without prior damage, and lets Mega Gengar OHKO neutral targets like Primal Groudon at +2. This move should only be used when Mega Gengar has a Spooky Plate, however. Secret Sword completes Mega Gengar's coverage by hitting targets that are resistant or immune to Ghost-type STAB moves, notably hitting Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Fur Coat Chansey for heavy damage after a boost. Lovely Kiss allows Mega Gengar to generate setup opportunities by putting foes to sleep and has increased effectiveness with Mold Breaker, as it then bypasses Magic Bounce. Sludge Bomb can be used to hit Mega Audino and has a guaranteed chance to OHKO non-Unaware Yveltal after Stealth Rock with a Tail Glow boost; it is used over Sludge Wave so that Mega Gengar can attempt to wear down its checks with potential poison. Note that running Sludge Bomb does not influence Mega Gengar's matchup against Imposter users in a significant way, as Mega Gengar has a heavy resistance to Sludge Bomb. Running Pursuit along with Mold Breaker is an option to trap and remove Shedinja for teams that need a Pokemon that compresses the role of an offensive Ghost-type and a check to Sturdy Shedinja, but it forces Mega Gengar to forgo one of its more useful moves. King's Shield remedies Mega Gengar's vulnerability to -ate users that can easily end its sweep if it doesn't have Dazzling. Taunt can be considered to bypass Prankster users like Registeel that do not have many ways to threaten Mega Gengar back, but Lovely Kiss is already an effective countermeasure against many defensive checks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Spooky Plate lets Mega Gengar fire off a strong Ghost-type STAB move while having no fear of Imposter, and it should always be used with Judgment. Focus Sash is an option that is to be used with Moongeist Beam and ensures that Mega Gengar gets a chance to set up. This can be useful considering how hard it is for Mega Gengar to generally find an opportunity to set up with its horrendous bulk. A Timid nature is used to at worst Speed tie with Mega Mewtwo X and opposing Mega Gengar. Mold Breaker lets Mega Gengar blow past Unaware users with boosted attacks and use Lovely Kiss and Spore without fear of Magic Bounce. Note that the ability is revealed when Mega Gengar enters the field and therefore removes the chance that Mega Gengar can force switches by bluffing a Normalize set, however. Adaptability gives more initial power, giving Mega Gengar a good chance to OHKO Giratina and Mega Audino after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Zygarde-C after some prior damage. However, Adaptability forgoes the option to deal heavier damage to Unaware users after Mega Gengar is boosted like with Mold Breaker. Dazzling, on the other hand, grants Mega Gengar safety from priority moves at the cost of forgoing the aforementioned abilities that let it bypass certain defensive walls.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gengar's sweep can be cut short by priority users like Kyurem-B and Triage Yveltal unless it chooses to run Dazzling, so it is important to ensure they have been eliminated. Assault Vest users can also stop Mega Gengar if it lacks a sleep-inducing move, so try to gain information about the opposing team before planning a sweep with Mega Gengar. As Mega Gengar does not have the best bulk, it should be brought in using forced switches. Depending on the moveset, the way players have to use Mega Gengar will also differ. For example, when Mega Gengar is using Judgment and is not running Mold Breaker, it will have good chance to successfully bluff Normalize sets, but when it runs Mold Breaker, which immediately reveals its ability, an opponent will typically anticipate Mega Gengar to be a setup variant and switch out to an appropriate check. As Mega Gengar will likely draw in bulky foes from a paranoid opponent, try to put them to sleep or wear them down with Sludge Bomb's potential poison. In addition, Lovely Kiss or Spore is best used with Mold Breaker, as Mega Gengar is unlikely going to have a second chance to sweep if its sleep move has been bounced back. However, these sleep moves are still unreliable against bulkier foes like Primal Kyogre that will require Mega Gengar to be lucky with sleep turns, so make sure they are weakened beforehand. Poison Heal users like Primal Kyogre and Regigigas can also be nuisances, as they can switch into Lovely Kiss freely after activating their Toxic Orb and survive a boosted attack from full health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is mandatory for Mega Gengar to meet various OHKO benchmarks against foes like Yveltal and Primal Groudon and avoid having its sweep stopped by Focus Sash users. Stealth Rock support on top of minimal prior damage weakens non-Unaware Mega Gyarados enough to be OHKOed by Secret Sword after a Shell Smash and ensures Yveltal is punished every time it switches in to revenge kill Mega Gengar. Spikes support is vastly appreciated to wear down Zygarde-C and Steel-types like Dialga and Registeel. Bulky Steel-types such as Registeel and Necrozma-DM can set up hazards for Mega Gengar while functioning as good switch-ins to priority users. Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Xerneas can threaten Zygarde-C and Kyurem-B and defeat Dark-types for Mega Gengar. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X, Choice Band Mega Tyranitar, and Primal Groudon can cause serious damage to defensive cores early-game and force opponents to play more defensively. Mega Gengar can then take advantage of defensive reactions and set up on a forced switch. Mega Gengar can also threaten passive Steel-types like Registeel and offensively check Necrozma-DM for said wallbreakers. Poison Heal sweepers such as Primal Kyogre and Regigigas can take advantage of most of Mega Gengar's checks. Primal Kyogre can wear down Unaware Pokemon with Scald or surprise them with Water Spout, while Regigigas can practically pressure any Pokemon that has enough special bulk to survive a hit from Mega Gengar. Poison Heal users' ability to absorb status and punish certain Trick users is also helpful. Imposter Chansey can help to scout Mega Gengar's setup targets to ensure that they don't carry hazardous moves like Knock Off, Spectral Thief, and Spore. Finally, Sturdy Shedinja is a considerable partner, as it threatens out a majority of the -ate users, Assault Vest pivots, and defensive Primal Kyogre that can check Mega Gengar and benefits from Mega Gengar threatening opposing Ghost-types.</p>"
      },
      "Normalize": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Entrainment replaces the foe's ability with Normalize, leaving it unable to damage Mega Gengar with almost any attacking moves, with exceptions like Revelation Dance and Z-Moves. Quiver Dance boosts Mega Gengar's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, making it harder to revenge kill. Shell Smash is an alternative option that provides Mega Gengar with more immediate power, but it comes at the cost of making Mega Gengar very vulnerable to -ate users. Judgment, with Spooky Plate intact, turns into a STAB Ghost-type attack that hits any neutral target with noticeable damage and remains a Normal-type attack for common Imposter-users that don't carry Plate items, letting Mega Gengar defeat them. Boomburst is the strongest secondary attack Mega Gengar can run to hit Normal-types that are immune to Judgment while leaving Imposter users unable to retaliate. Psystrike is an alternative option to hit specially defensive foes like Chansey, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Audino harder than Boomburst. Its lower damage output against Yveltal can be detrimental, however. Taunt can be used to deal with Prankster users like Registeel and prevent recovery moves and status moves such as Spore, which still affects Mega Gengar even after the foe gains Normalize. Note that forgoing a Normal-type attack move is going leave Mega Gengar completely walled by Normal-types. King's Shield, on the other hand, prevents Mega Gengar from easily folding against priority users by halving their Attack stat if they use contact move, though this move faces similar opportunity cost to Taunt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed with a Timid nature allows Mega Gengar to at worst Speed tie with Mega Mewtwo X and outspeed slower foes like Kartana. Spooky Plate allows Mega Gengar to use Ghost-type STAB Judgment while also being immune to the Normal-type Judgment of common Imposter users. Normalize is needed for Mega Gengar to give foes Normalize through Entrainment, changing most of their attacking moves to Normal-type and leaving them with no way to damage Mega Gengar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Before attempting to neutralize an opposing Pokemon with Entrainment, scout for foes that can effectively counter this set. This means Pokemon with Magic Bounce, Comatose, Revelation Dance, and Z-Crystals should be identified. Even when one has ensured that an opposing Pokemon cannot hurt Mega Gengar in any way after gaining Normalize, be wary of status moves such as Spore, Glare, and Taunt, as they are still effective. Priority move users like Kyurem-B should also be faced with caution, as they can strike the frail Mega Gengar first. Trick and Switcheroo will still affect Mega Gengar and take its Spooky Plate away, significantly hampering its overall usefulness. Lastly, keep Mega Gengar away from any form of damage, as priority move users, even Mega Diancie, may be able stop a weakened Mega Gengar from cleaning a team lacking a proper check. When these conditions of safety are met, Mega Gengar can easily finish weakened teams without much concern.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Imposter Chansey is helpful to Normalize Mega Gengar due to its ability to switch into various foes and identify their movesets and abilities. Yveltal is one of the more problematic enemies for Mega Gengar, as it commonly runs Revelation Dance, so Fairy-types like Mega Audino and Xerneas should be used to guard Mega Gengar against it and other Dark-types, and they are also generally great switch-ins to Knock Off if running Poison Heal. Steel-types such as Solgaleo and Kartana effectively threaten Magic Bounce Mega Audino, which is a serious problem for Mega Gengar to deal with. Defensive Steel-types in general are good partners, as they can generate momentum with U-turn and switch into any offensive priority moves. Knock Off and Poison Fang from various walls can make Fur Coat Chansey easier to handle, as its tremendous bulk lets it check Mega Gengar lacking Taunt easily. Regigigas and Shedinja appreciates Mega Gengar threatening Ghost-types like Giratina and Aegislash. The former can also switch into status moves, which defensive foes might rely on to check Mega Gengar. Entry hazard support is appreciated, as this variant of Mega Gengar forces a lot of switches. Stealth Rock is helpful to punish Yveltal, and Toxic Spikes can be used to wear down Chansey and Mega Audino; Mega Gengar can also remove Toxic Spikes itself in case they are bounced back. Teams lacking solid counterplay against Normalize Mega Gengar will rely on it getting slowly worn down over the match. Entry hazard removal support from Pokemon like Giratina can prevent Mega Gengar from taking unnecessary damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes, while Magic Bounce users like Mega Audino and Registeel can also be considered. Magic Bounce users can also pivot into status moves like Spore or Glare that could be crippling. Mega Gengar has an unfavorable matchup against Primal Kyogre, as it commonly runs Revelation Dance and has high special bulk that can be further amplified if running Assault Vest. Effective countermeasures like Primal Groudon can become necessary for this reason. Though they are less common, Trick and Switcheroo can be problematic to deal with. Thus, aforementioned Pokemon with irremovable items, such as Giratina with Griseous Orb and Groudon with Red Orb, can be helpful. Other bulky Pokemon using Darkinium Z in tandem with Z-Parting Shot can fulfill the same role while fully restoring Mega Gengar's HP in a pinch.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey boasts a gigantic base 250 HP stat that, when coupled with Eviolite, allows it to be a very bulky Pokemon that serves as a powerful special wall. Imposter allows Chansey to copy the opposing Pokemon's typing, moves, and stats minus HP, while retaining its greatest assets in its huge HP stat and Eviolite boosts, allowing it to act as an all-purpose check to almost any Pokemon, as it will always be bulkier. Imposter also inherits the opposing Pokemon's stat changes and, when coupled with its preserved bulk, allows Chansey to be a formidable check to nearly every setup sweeper in the metagame. Therefore, Imposter Chansey puts a huge strain on teambuilding, as teams must carry checks to their own Pokemon to avoid losing multiple Pokemon or, in more extreme cases, the game entirely to a Transformed Chansey. Additionally, this ability allows Chansey to effortlessly scout for the foe's moveset simply by switching in, an extremely valuable asset to have in a metagame where movesets can be unpredictable. Alternatively, Fur Coat propels Chansey's middling Defense stat up to a respectable amount, allowing it to act as a sturdy mixed wall that is able to switch into many powerful Pokemon, like Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B.</p> <p>However, due to how omnipresent Imposter Chansey is, every competent team prepares thoroughly for it, reducing its overall effectiveness. A few offensive Pokemon, such as Judgment + Spooky Plate Mega Gengar and Poison Heal Regigigas, are capable of defeating an Imposter Chansey one-on-one by exploiting certain things Imposter is unable to copy, such as the opponent's item and status condition. Additionally, Chansey's item choices are quite limited, in that it often requires Eviolite or Choice Scarf to be a huge threat, making it quite weak to Knock Off. This means that unlike other bulky Pokemon, Chansey cannot afford the luxury of choosing an alternative item such as Safety Goggles, Leftovers, or even a Z-Crystal for more flexibility, making it quite predictable in that aspect. Therefore, Chansey's non-Imposter sets are vulnerable to moves like Taunt and the ever-so-common Spore thanks to its limited item selection.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Chansey's signature item, Lucky Punch, can be used over Eviolite on its Imposter set to help it muscle past Imposter checks with powerful critical hits. However, it is inconsistent and takes away from Chansey's bulk, one of its most defining and important features. It also faces competition from Pikachu, whose Light Ball makes it a more potent Imposter Pokemon for breaking, though Chansey still has the surprise factor and a huge defensive edge on Pikachu. If one is especially weak to Judgment sweepers such as Mega Gengar, an Earth Plate is an item worth considering on Imposter Chansey, as it turns Judgment into a Ground-type attack to hit common Judgment users hard. These include Zekrom, Reshiram, and the aforementioned Mega Gengar. Toxic Orb can be used to totally shut down Poison Heal sweepers that rely on Chansey not being poisoned to win. However, its usefulness is quite matchup dependent. Alternative abilities include Unaware to let Chansey check setup sweepers and Magic Bounce to bounce back dangerous moves Chansey cannot otherwise handle effectively such as Spore, but Fur Coat's defensive boosts are often more valuable, and these abilities are more worthwhile on another Pokemon, such as Zygarde-C or Registeel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Shedinja can switch into any one of Chansey's sets with relative ease and immediately poses a huge threat, as it can use Endeavor to drastically lower Fur Coat Chansey's HP and use a priority move like Extreme Speed or Pursuit to finish off Chansey. Additionally, Shedinja can also pivot out to a Pursuit-using ally to inflict large amounts of damage to Imposter Chansey, as Shedinja often minimizes its Defense and Special Defense IVs to increase Imposter Chansey's frailty. Additionally, Shedinja can use Foresight in order to be able to hit Imposter Chansey with Endeavor or run Pursuit itself in order to stay in and defeat Imposter Chansey by itself.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: A few Pokemon are capable of dealing a large amount of damage to Fur Coat Chansey, deterring it from switching in. These Pokemon include Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X, Red Orb Groudon, Steelworker Kartana, and Necrozma-DM. Imposter Chansey also doesn't enjoy switching in on these threats. Kartana, Groudon, and Mega Mewtwo X are just some examples of Pokemon that can deal a huge amount of damage to an Imposter Chansey Transformed into themselves or even OHKO it outright.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Imposter Sets:</strong> As Imposter Chansey is very common and very threatening but also predictable since it always copies a set the opponent created, players commonly create sets designed to lure, trap, and KO Imposter users. Abilities such as Quick Feet and Unburden let a Pokemon outspeed its Imposter or Speed tie with it if it has a Choice Scarf. When combined with moves like Imprison and moves capable of KOing an Imposter Chansey (e.g., a Fire-type coverage move on Kartana), it can be beaten easily. Moves such as Thousand Waves and Anchor Shot allow Pokemon to trap and PP stall their Imposter, taking advantage of its low PP. In the same vein, Pokemon that rely on attacks like Judgment, a move whose typing depends on the item that Pokemon is holding, make for good checks to Imposter Chansey, as it can do very little in return. The most prominent example of this is Mega Gengar, which commonly carries Spooky Plate. Once Eviolite Chansey transforms into Mega Gengar, its Judgment remains a Normal-type move, meaning it cannot deal any damage to Mega Gengar while in return takes a lot of damage from a Ghost-type Judgment. Fur Coat Chansey, however, can use Whirlwind to force it out or predict an attack and use Metal Burst.</p> <p><strong>Poison Heal Users:</strong> Common Poison Heal Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar and Primal Kyogre worry little about Imposter Chansey, as it cannot copy status ailments. As such, it misses out on crucial Poison Heal recovery, meaning it fails to keep up with its foe. Additionally, the aforementioned Pokemon often carry moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed while also forgoing recovery moves to worsen the situation, as then Chansey is slowly whittled down whilst being unable to fight back. Fur Coat Chansey also struggles a lot against them, as they commonly carry moves like Spore, Magma Storm, and Knock Off and can play around Metal Burst with ease thanks to the passive recovery.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Attackers:</strong> Fur Coat Chansey is susceptible to physical Mold Breaker sweepers or users of the move Sunsteel Strike, as they ignore Fur Coat altogether to hit Chansey hard. Additionally, Pokemon that run Mold Breaker often, such as Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo X, carry moves that hit Chansey physically, like Secret Sword and Close Combat, respectively. However, Mold Breaker does not prevent or hamper the Imposter set from functioning properly.</p>",

      "Imposter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Most of the time Chansey inherits the moves of the Pokemon it transforms into, so the selected moves are chosen to help Chansey deal with the rare instances in which Imposter fails to activate. Shore Up allows Chansey to recover its HP, meaning it can still operate as a bootleg defensive Pokemon should Imposter not activate. Whirlwind is used to phaze the foe should they be behind a Substitute, as that disables Imposter from activating. It also serves as a way to handle setup sweepers, as Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre and Mega Gengar can very easily set up on Chansey and overpower it. U-turn lets Chansey pivot out safely to a more threatening teammate to avoid being taken advantage of. Metal Burst provides Chansey with some offensive presence. As it deals damage based on the amount of HP Chansey takes from a move that turn, it can inflict some serious damage if used correctly. Once shown, it can also discourage the opponent from attacking Chansey in fear of being KOed in return. Final Gambit is an option to essentially net a trade KO. This could be useful if KOing a switch-in is more beneficial than keeping Chansey around. Thanks to Chansey's sky-high HP stat, so long as it is at a moderately high amount of HP, it can KO a large majority of the metagame. Trick can be used to cripple an enemy with a burdening item. It's recommended to only use Trick when equipped with a Choice Scarf, as giving up Eviolite is seldom is a worthwhile trade-off. Alternative move options include Parting Shot over U-turn to net some momentum against Pokemon Chansey has failed to Transform into. It also comes with the added benefit of ignoring Substitute, one method of preventing Imposter from activating, while also forcing Magic Bounce Pokemon to switch out, though this could easily backfire as it'd give the opponent a free switch to whatever they desire. Refresh could also be chosen for its ability to remove any burdening status ailments, as they carry over even when transformed. Lastly, Spectral Thief or Haze removes any stat boosts the foe may have, somewhat alleviating Chansey's big weakness to being made setup fodder. These could be chosen over Whirlwind, if one forgoes that move, in case Chansey's team struggles to check specific sets that Whirlwind is useless against such as a sweeper with Magic Bounce.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite boosts Chansey's defenses both prior to and during transformation, granting Chansey a lot of additional bulk and enabling it to effortlessly deal with so many Pokemon one-on-one. A viable alternative to Eviolite is Choice Scarf. Although it gives up a lot of bulk and locks Chansey into one move, it'll be able to outspeed setup sweepers rather than simply Speed tie with them. A Relaxed nature is used to further boost Chansey's lackluster Defense stat whilst minimizing its Speed stat. This is important,  as moves like Metal Burst and U-turn are more effective when used last. However, sometimes 252 Speed EVs with an Impish nature can be beneficial, as then Chansey will outspeed opposing Imposter users and Transform into them if both Imposters are switched in at the same time. This allows you to safely scout the opposing Chansey's set as well as use their moves without losing PP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Always keep in mind that simply bringing a Chansey to a battle puts immense pressure on the opponent, as they must utilize their offensive Pokemon carefully to avoid being swept by their own Pokemon. Another important note is that Chansey is incredibly weak before Transforming, as it cannot defend itself very well against Pokemon that can switch in and damage it heavily or use certain moves like Spore. Therefore, one should actively prevent Chansey from participating in battle untransformed as much as possible. In most instances, Chansey is an extremely effective lead, as it can safely scout its foe's set without being in danger of being trapped and PP stalled. Only in certain situations (for instance, when leading off against a self-Imposterproofed Mega Gengar) will it be a poor choice. Even in this instance, though, you can still determine your best course of action safely after scouting the opposing set's moves. Pivot Chansey in whenever possible to scout for the foe's set. That information could prove incredibly useful when making decisions later on in the battle. It is encouraged that one switch Chansey in on a defensive Pokemon like Giratina or Mega Audino, as in most instances, they can do very little damage to it. If it does fall low on HP, however, one can switch it in on said defensive Pokemon and utilize their own status moves or abilities such as Regenerator or Magic Bounce with little resistance, as often those Pokemon can do little to stop Chansey from doing so. One might also wish to double switch Chansey in when predicting an opponent's switch, as that is a good way to determine a Pokemon's set. It should be noted, however, that certain Pokemon such as Zygarde-C, Registeel, and Mega Steelix may run sets specifically designed to trap and KO Imposter users with moves like Anchor Shot, hoping to catch Imposter users and PP stall them until they're KOed. For this reason, Chansey should be careful not to recklessly switch into Pokemon that commonly use these sets. Despite having a high HP stat and access to Eviolite, Chansey can ill afford to switch into hard-hitting threats repeatedly, especially if the aforementioned threats are they themselves frail, as you'll be copying their defensive stats as well, or hit super effectively by their own moves. Examples of frail threats include Deoxys-A and Mega Sceptile, and examples of threats hit hard by their own moves include Red Orb Groudon and certain Mega Gengar sets. However, if they are also boosting their defensive stats through the means of Quiver Dance, Chansey can actually switch in quite safely. Thanks to Imposter's mechanics, Chansey is effective at stalling PP, as it can refresh its limited PP simply by switching out. This gives Chansey the edge in PP stalling situations.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to the nature of Imposter, Chansey can fit on nearly every team archetype and is very self-sufficient, so it rarely requires team support to function. Having said that, Chansey appreciates being able to switch in freely, which slow allies such as Registeel, Aegislash, and Mega Audino can allow it to with U-turn or Parting Shot. The aforementioned Pokemon are also useful for setting up entry hazards to not only deter Sturdy Shedinja, a Pokemon Chansey has a tough time beating, from switching in but also deal some chip damage to assist in a potential countersweep. It also breaks any Focus Sashes that frail Pokemon like Deoxys-A commonly use to protect themselves against Imposter Chansey, as they are frail yet powerful enough to OHKO a Transformed Chansey after setting up. As Chansey takes damage from hazards before transforming, it's susceptible to every form of hazard, which can wear it down rather quickly. The aforementioned slow allies all do well as hazard removers. Pokemon that can handle common Judgment users like Mega Gengar and Arceus make for great teammates, as Chansey cannot handle them in a one-on-one situation. These Pokemon include Yveltal and Primal Kyogre, which are valuable for their ability to check Mega Gengar, easily the most common user of this strategy, with ease. Another archetype of sweepers Imposter Chansey struggles to beat one-on-one are Poison Heal sweepers. Users like Regigigas, Xerneas, and Primal Kyogre often have no problem putting Chansey to sleep and then slowly beating it down, taking advantage of the Imposter's lack of Poison Heal recovery. Teammates like Zygarde-C and Giratina are some tried-and-true checks to Regigigas, whereas some Primal Kyogre sets and Toxic Orb Magic Guard Ho-Oh can deal with Xerneas handily. Lastly, Primal Kyogre is checked by Red Orb Groudon and RegenVest Primal Kyogre. RegenVest users also are helpful for Chansey, as not only can they deal with the problematic Mega Gengar, they also switch into opposing Imposter Chansey and take advantage of its passiveness to recover HP. Viable RegenVest Pokemon include Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, and Dialga. Teammates with Misty Surge are also beneficial, as they help protect Chansey from crippling status ailments. Chansey's status carries over every time it is Transformed, meaning if it is burned it cannot be as effective as a physical damage dealer, for instance. Defensive pivots like Giratina and Primal Kyogre are some examples of viable Misty Surge users.</p>"
      },
      "Fur Coat": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shore Up is mandatory, as it increases Chansey's longevity and allows it to switch in repeatedly in all stages of the game. It also keeps Chansey's HP high in order to use Metal Burst more frequently and to greater effect. Metal Burst provides some offensive presence and allows Chansey to remain functional even when hit with Taunt. It also deals a hefty amount of damage, and the HP loss isn't too detrimental, as Fur Coat Chansey can sponge hits well. Whirlwind prevents Chansey from becoming setup fodder, as Chansey can do very little to threaten Pokemon using setup moves such as Primal Kyogre and Mega Mewtwo Y. It also has no way of touching foes behind a Substitute, as Metal Burst does not bypass it. Topsy-Turvy enables Chansey to further Imposter-proof a team and maintain offensive momentum. U-turn allows Chansey to safely switch, generating momentum for the team. Baton Pass functions similarly, though has twice as much PP and doesn't make contact, crucially avoiding being hurt by moves like Baneful Bunker and Spiky Shield; however, it also passes on unwanted effects such as Leech Seed and Parting Shot's debuffs, moves used pretty often against Chansey. Wish could be an option to consider alongside Shore Up, allowing Chansey to be able to support its team by passing large HP refills. This move pairs nicely with U-turn or Baton Pass, as Chansey is often slow enough to grant a chosen ally a free switch in addition to a large HP restoration. However, it should be noted that Chansey can be taken advantage of quite easily by an opposing Imposter Chansey if one opts to use Wish, as the foe can freely use Wish to support their own team and Fur Coat Chansey can do little to prevent that. If Wish is chosen, it can be run in the fourth slot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is the mandatory item, as it boosts Chansey's defensive stats by a considerable amount. Fur Coat further boosts its Defense to a point where it can comfortably wall physical threats despite its base 5 Defense. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs is useful for getting off a slow Baton Pass to build up momentum. Additionally, this makes Chansey as slow as possible in order for it to be outsped by as many Pokemon as possible so as to make better use of Metal Burst.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Chansey in on threats it can check, such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B. However, one should be careful about dangerous status moves such as Spore, Trick,  and Taunt, as they can reduce Chansey's effectiveness heavily. One should attempt to determine if the foe carries one of those moves, as well as other such dangerous status moves,  before blindly switching Chansey in. Chansey also is incredibly susceptible to Knock Off, as the move rids it of its precious Eviolite. Therefore, it is advised that you carefully scout for the moves of suspected Knock Off users such as Yveltal, Regigigas, and Mega Tyranitar before switching Chansey in. Additionally, although Chansey is a sturdy physical wall, it can ill afford to switch into the tier's hardest hitters such as Steelworker Kartana and Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X. As Chansey heavily relies on its ability to sponge physical attacks aimed at it, Mold Breaker Pokemon are especially threatening, as they simply ignore Fur Coat altogether, so ensure Chansey avoids them at all costs. In the same vein, Sunsteel Strike users such as Necrozma-DM and Kartana are also very threatening for Chansey. Boosting physical sweepers commonly carry the move to pierce abilities such as Fur Coat, so it is advised to scout for the move on suspected physical sweepers before sending Chansey out against them. Chansey is best used to supplement an existing defensive core, as it's a good blanket check to many threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Giratina, Aegislash, and Zygarde-C form a solid defensive core with Chansey, as the former two Pokemon can handle Fighting-types that trouble Chansey, and the latter is an excellent all-purpose physically defensive wall. Additionally, these Pokemon greatly appreciate Chansey's ability to easily tank common special moves, such as Ice Beam and Blue Flare, aimed at its allies. They are all also viable users of entry hazards, which Chansey can take advantage of because it forces many switches either by simply switching in or using Whirlwind. Offensive Pokemon Chansey can Imposterproof include Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y, certain Mega Gengar sets, and the majority of -ate sets, though Chansey is extremely passive and often doesn't fit perfectly on very many teams  A Magic Bounce Pokemon such as Registeel can bounce back dangerous status moves like Spore that threaten Chansey. Additionally, Chansey can do very little to prevent the foe from setting up entry hazards, so a Magic Bounce Pokemon can easily take advantage of that by switching in and reflecting them right back. This proves especially useful should the opponent have a Sturdy Shedinja, as Chansey can do literally nothing to prevent it from switching in and forcing Chansey out. Running hazard removal is a safer way to deal with entry hazards, however. Defensive Pokemon like Registeel and Giratina make good users of Defog. As Chansey is often a prime target for Knock Off and Spore users, one can opt to use a Poison Heal user with Toxic Orb to absorb the moves; Knock Off proves useless if the ally has already activated it, and Spore is ineffective against a Pokemon already afflicted by a status ailment. Prime users of Poison Heal include Zygarde-C, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Tyranitar. Funnily enough, Imposter Chansey can pair well with Fur Coat Chansey. As mentioned earlier, Imposter Chansey can scout the opponent's sets easily, revealing dangerous lure sets and moves. Lastly, Misty Surge allies protect Chansey from status, widening the list of sets it's able to check and preventing it from being crippled. Defensive pivots like Giratina and Primal Kyogre are some examples of viable Misty Surge users.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>As the lone legal user of Parental Bond, Mega Kangaskhan finds itself in a potent position as unique wallbreaker that breaks down and 2HKOes almost the entire metagame, making it a huge threat to stall and balance teams. Also, its decent bulk, respectable Speed tier, and ability to wallbreak without fear of common status and Knock Off let it switch in easily on many common walls and pose an immediate threat. However, Mega Kangaskhan still struggles from being one-dimensional, as the two-turn combination of Nature's Madness + Night Shade or Seismic Toss is slow and relatively easy to play around with the right preparation, less efficient than the quick KOs of dedicated wallbreakers, ineffective against the multitude of slow, bulky pivots in the metagame (especially those with Regenerator), and reliant on correct prediction against Normal- and Ghost-types. On top of that, because Parental Bond is restricted to Mega Kangaskhan, Kangaskhan must start out in its normal forme and cannot run any item besides Kangaskhanite if it wants to take advantage of the ability. Additionally, Mega Kangaskhan's poor defensive typing, only decent bulk, and lack of any immediately threatening offensive presence leave it vulnerable to being picked off by faster, stronger enemies such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Mewtwo X, all of which outspeed and threaten to OHKO, making Mega Kangaskhan relatively useless against offensive teams. In addition, Mega Kangaskhan suffers a bit from four-moveslot syndrome, as it is usually restricted to only one coverage move after Nature's Madness, Night Shade, and recovery, limiting its ability to confront more niche walls like Shedinja. Finally, its reliance on its ability makes it vulnerable to the plethora of ability-suppressing moves in the metagame, and it is a sitting duck should its ability be neutralized by any of them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the wallbreaker set, Mega Kangaskhan can also use Magic Guard as an ability to prevent entry hazard damage, but Misty Surge is generally more useful, as it provides lasting benefits. Pursuit along with Mold Breaker before Mega Evolution can be used to trap Shedinja before Mega Evolving and nail foes that try to flee after Nature's Madness, but it has very limited use and is rarely seen. Unfortunately, Pursuit also doesn't otherwise deal much damage to Ghost- and Normal-types that give Mega Kangaskhan the most problems, so it doesn't really have the space to fit in. Besides the wallbreaker set, Mega Kangaskhan has few viable options to use that aren't simply outclassed by other sets on other Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Sturdy Shedinja takes no damage from any of the attacks that Mega Kangaskhan uses bar Sunsteel Strike, which is relatively rare.</p> <p><strong>Passive Healing</strong>: Because Mega Kangaskhan cannot OHKO opposing Pokemon with Nature's Madness or Night Shade, Pokemon with extraordinary healing capabilities can usually shrug off its attacks and counterattack. For example, Poison Heal users, particularly Regigigas for its immunity to Night Shade and Giratina for its massive HP stat, can use Poison Heal to prevent the 2HKO from Nature's Madness + Night Shade / Seismic Toss. Regenerator Pokemon can heal off damage while pivoting out and bringing in an offensive threat to KO Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Ability Suppression</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan relies on Parental Bond to break down walls, so any move that suppresses abilities, such as Worry Seed, Entrainment, or slow Core Enforcer, can neuter it. This is especially effective because Mega Kangaskhan cannot OHKO its targets, giving them ample time to suppress its ability.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Offense</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan is slow for an attacker and only decently bulky and will fall to any even neutral powerful attack. Thus, Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Beedrill can easily defeat it before it can attack.</p> <p><strong>Prankster</strong>: Prankster Pokemon such as Registeel and Giratina move before Mega Kangaskhan, easily shut it down by removing Parental Bond with Entrainment, and can recover from its attacks, even if they switch into Nature's Madness, as their moves receive priority. They can even bring it down with them with using Destiny Bond. However, they have to be careful of being picked off by Extreme Speed when at low health.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan is complete setup bait for any faster Pokemon that won't fall to Nature's Madness + Extreme Speed. Though they will find it difficult to switch in, setup sweepers resistant or immune to Extreme Speed such as Mega Gengar, Mega Tyranitar, Necrozma-DM, and Dazzling users can easily set up and OHKO Mega Kangaskhan if they get a free switch in.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nature's Madness and Night Shade in conjunction with Parental Bond after Mega Evolution is what enables Mega Kangaskhan to 2HKO virtually the entire metagame. Nature's Madness brings opposing Pokemon down to at most only 25% of their maximum HP, leaving them within range to be KOed by Night Shade. Night Shade is the best constant-damage move, as it hits Giratina and other Ghost-types, which are generally a bigger threat than the Normal-types that Seismic Toss hits. The third slot should be used as recovery so Mega Kangaskhan can heal off chip damage and weaker attacks. Strength Sap is the best option, as it takes advantage of the high average Attack stat of Pokemon in Balanced Hackmons to recover massive amounts of damage instantly while lowering the foe's Attack stat and making it even more difficult for them to take Mega Kangaskhan down. Shore Up can also be used as recovery, as it is slightly more reliable, healing a consistent half of Mega Kangaskhan's maximum health. The last slot is typically used for coverage. Extreme Speed is a fantastic STAB move that lets Mega Kangaskhan hit faster threats that switch into Nature's Madness or even Night Shade as well as finish off Normal-types. Mega Kangaskhan can also run Seismic Toss so it can KO Normal-types immune to Night Shade, but this is generally not necessary, as Extreme Speed takes out both Regigigas and Arceus, the only relevant Normal-types Mega Kangaskhan has to deal with, after Nature's Madness. Alternatively, Anchor Shot can trap opposing Pokemon and reliably take them down, while Sunsteel Strike can be used to hit Shedinja and Mega Audino for decent damage, and Taunt can be used to shut down Prankster recovery and generally passive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Kangaskhanite enables Mega Kangaskhan to take advantage of Parental Bond. With Parental Bond, Nature's Madness reduces the target's HP to only 25%, while Night Shade and Seismic Toss deal 200 HP of damage, letting Mega Kangaskhan 2HKO the entire metagame, barring foes with passive recovery. Misty Surge is the best ability to use before Mega Evolution, protecting Mega Kangaskhan from being statused (in particular, with sleep) and weakening Dragon-type attacks that it might have to face. It also prevents opposing Toxic Orbs from activating, letting Mega Kangaskhan break down Poison Heal users such as Giratina and Xerneas. Intimidate can also be used to weaken opposing physical attacks and create more safe opportunities for Kangaskhan to come in and Mega Evolve. A Jolly nature is used to maximize Mega Kangaskhan's Speed so it can beat up to maximum investment base 99 Speed Pokemon such as Yveltal and Xerneas. If no physical attacks are used, a Timid nature with 0 Attack EVs is preferred to minimize confusion damage and reduce opposing Strength Sap healing from typical users such as Giratina.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is best used as a liberal check to most common metagame walls, especially before it Mega Evolves, and can still take advantage of Misty Surge to prevent itself from being crippled by status they tend to carry. Early-game, Kangaskhan can serve as an immediate offensive threat whose Misty Terrain can prevent opposing Toxic Orb Poison Heal users from activating their abilities. This is also the ideal time to take advantage of Mega Kangaskhan's wallbreaking ability, as it can be used to easily bring down opposing walls within KO range of partner sweepers. Use Nature's Madness only if Night Shade and Seismic Toss don't 2HKO, as they have far more PP, won't miss, and generally 2HKO most of the metagame anyway. Use recovery moves when there is a free opportunity to—that is, on a predicted switch or against more passive Pokemon that can't deal much damage. Avoid recklessly Mega Evolving unless you plan on staying in, as Kangaskhan can be switched in and out to support its teammates with Misty Terrain. Once Misty Terrain has ended, be wary of status effects, as sleep shuts Kangaskhan down, burn reduces the power of Extreme Speed, poison reduces its longevity, and paralysis makes it easier to pick off. Be wary of slow pivots, as Mega Kangaskhan struggles to confront offensive Pokemon that they can pivot to, especially if they pivot out the turn Mega Kangaskhan switches in. Mega Kangaskhan also generally has difficulty wearing them down anyway, especially if they have Regenerator. If Strength Sap and Extreme Speed are used, Mega Kangaskhan can even check Imposter Chansey, as it cannot be KOed by its own Nature's Madness and Night Shade, and it does not have to fear Extreme Speed once the opposing Imposter user's Attack is lowered. Alternatively, if Anchor Shot is used, this set can even trap Imposter users to PP stall them to death while healing off attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with passive recovery, mainly Poison Heal Giratina and Regigigas, or Prankster make great partners to shut down Imposter users. For example, offensive Poison Heal users like Xerneas have great offensive synergy with Mega Kangaskhan as well, as they can reliably put opposing Pokemon to sleep, granting Mega Kangaskhan an easy switch in while it counters bulkier checks and counters in return. Alternatively, Prankster Ghost-types can easily switch into Nature's Madness and recover without fear of being picked off by Extreme Speed. Shedinja can also fulfill this function if Mega Kangaskhan does not use Sunsteel Strike, but its vulnerability to entry hazard damage makes it unreliable. Mega Kangaskhan also appreciate counters to Shedinja itself, as Shedinja is one of the only walls that it cannot break down. Mold Breaker Pokemon such as Mega Gengar as well as surprise Mold Breaker moves work well for this, and Ghost-types such as Giratina also serve as good defensive teammates for this reason. Powerful, fast sweepers like -ate users, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Gengar enjoy having walls weakened and can help check offensive Pokemon that threaten Mega Kangaskhan. Slow pivots work well to shield Mega Kangaskhan from attacks and bring it in safely, and they can neutralize annoying abilities such as Poison Heal and Regenerator to help Mega Kangaskhan wallbreak. Toxic Spikes support, though a niche option that is relatively rare, can also be useful, as it lets Mega Kangaskhan wallbreak more easily without needing to waste two turns to KO opposing Pokemon.</p>"

  "Gyarados-Mega": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gyarados's good Attack stat and decent Water / Dark typing allow it to threaten a lot of defensive Pokemon such as Giratina, Aegislash, and Mega Tyranitar and serve as a wallbreaker. Its typing also provides good resistances that allow Mega Gyarados to check Primal Kyogre and most Psychic-types as well as enabling it to Imposter-proof itself with Poison Heal or Unaware. It can also check setup sweepers with its decent bulk and resistance to common moves that they bring such as Stored Power, Power Trip, Sunsteel Strike, and Moongeist Beam. Mega Gyarados's Speed, albeit below average, is enough to fulfill to the role of a wallbreaker and also allows it to get a slow U-turn on base 90 Speed Pokemon like Giratina and Primal Kyogre.</p> <p>However, Mega Gyarados is easily accounted for with its number of weaknesses and can be surprised with coverage moves from Pokemon it should check such as Fleur Cannon from Mega Mewtwo Y and Moonblast from Poison Heal Primal Kyogre. Having an Electric- and Bug-type weakness makes Mega Gyarados especially vulnerable to Pokemon such as Zekrom and U-turn users like Giratina and Primal Kyogre, and it's also susceptible to common coverage in Fairy- and Fighting-type moves from Pokemon such as Xerneas and Mega Gengar and strong physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X. This greatly compromises Mega Gyarados's ability to check threats. It is also susceptible to being worn down quickly by entry hazards and has a weakness to common pivot moves in U-turn and Volt Switch from defensive threats. It despises any sort of damaging status, which makes it unable to do its job effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>0 IVs with a Brave nature can be used for Shift Gear and Shell Smash sets to avoid having their boosts stolen the turn they set up, at the cost of a huge amount of Speed. However, since most Spectral Thief users cannot beat Mega Gyarados one-on-one even after stealing its boosts, its utility is limited. A RegenVest set is viable, but Mega Gyarados is weak to both U-turn and Volt Switch as well as common coverage in Fairy- and Fighting-type moves, making it not as effective as other RegenVest users such as Registeel and Necrozma-DM. Choice Band Mega Gyarados with Mold Breaker or Tough Claws can be used as a wallbreaker, but it is easily revenged killed, as its Speed is only mediocre without boosting. Fur Coat can be used for better mixed bulk, but that role is better performed by Chansey, Primal Kyogre, (comma) or Zygarde-C. A Shell Smash set with White Herb and Unburden is usable, but it is stopped fairly quickly by Prankster Haze users and priority attackers, as it has no longevity and can only be used once. A set with Shell Smash and Dazzling is viable, as it cannot be easily revenge killed by -ate users; however, it requires extensive team support and can be stopped by Prankster Haze users such as Aegislash and Primal Kyogre as well as physically defensive Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Primal Groudon. A set with Shell Smash and Simple is also viable, but unlike the above Shell Smash set, it can be easily revenged killed by priority users and stopped by Prankster Haze or Unaware walls such as Mega Audino and Zygarde-C. It also really gets only one opportunity to set up, having almost no longevity. Dragon Dance can be used over Shift Gear in the Poison Heal set, as it has more PP, allowing Mega Gyarados to not get PP stalled; however, Mega Gyarados usually appreciates the additional Speed boost from Shift Gear.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Mega Gyarados struggles to break past bulky Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Mega Audino and is easily KOed by a super effective move such as Light of Ruin or Pixilated Boomburst from offensive Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie. Mega Gyarados is also overwhelmed by common Fairy-type coverage from Pokemon it checks such as Fleur Cannon from Mega Mewtwo Y.</p> <p><strong>-ate users</strong>: -ate users, especially of Pixilate and Galvanize, such as Mega Diancie, Mega Mewtwo X, and Zekrom can threaten Mega Gyarados out with their powerful super effective attacks, although they require prior damage to KO and may get KOed in return by a boosted attack from Mega Gyarados or lose their items to Knock Off, which they do not appreciate.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Poison Heal Users</strong>: Poison Heal users such as Xerneas and Primal Kyogre do not mind having their Toxic Orb knocked off after it has been activated. They are able to beat both defensive and offensive variants of Mega Gyarados if it has not accumulated many boosts, as Xerneas can KO with a powerful Moonblast and Primal Kyogre either outboosts or has Spectral Thief.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attacks</strong>: Mega Gyarados’s physical bulk is rather low, so strong physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X and Kartana force it out easily. Fighting-type coverage moves are also dangerous, as most of them are physical and can easily overwhelm Mega Gyarados. However, physical attackers are unable to switch in directly to the Poison Heal set, as Mega Gyarados can remove their boosting items with Knock Off or cripple them with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Primal Groudon are able to take hits from offensive Mega Gyarados and remove its boosts or use it as setup fodder, respectively. Primal Groudon is an exceptionally good check to offensive Mega Gyarados, as it is immune to Water-type attacks and cannot lose its Red Orb to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Common Support Moves</strong>: Status affects Mega Gyarados’s effectiveness in any role, either nullifying its defensive capability or putting it on a timer. Mega Gyarados also is vulnerable to common utility moves like Core Enforcer, Knock Off, and Spectral Thief and is dead weight against VoltTurn.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Pokemon with Mold Breaker such as Mega Garchomp and Mega Gengar are able to break through Unaware Mega Gyarados.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off can remove foes' items such as Eviolite, Leftovers, and Safety Goggles. Spectral Thief steals boosts from setup sweepers such as Yveltal, Groudon, and Primal Kyogre. It can also hit Psychic- and Ghost-types for super effective damage. Topsy Turvy can be used on Normal-types such as Regigigas and Slaking and certain setup sweepers that threaten to 2HKO Mega Gyarados such as offensive Poison Heal Primal Kyogre, but it is bounced back by Magic Bounce, cannot go through a Substitute, and does not deal damage. Shore Up increases Mega Gyarados’s longevity so it can continuously tank hits. U-turn gains momentum against defensive Pokemon such as Giratina and Zygarde-C. Alternatively, Anchor Shot lets Mega Gyarados trap Imposter users such as Chansey and PP stall them, although it will leave Mega Gyarados in an awkward spot once the opponent gets a free switch afterward. It also allows Mega Gyarados to trap defensive Pokemon so Mega Gyarados can either remove their items with Knock Off or weaken them along with hitting Fairy-types for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Safety Goggles prevents Mega Gyarados from being affected by powder moves like Spore from Pokemon such as Regigigas and Mega Mewtwo Y. Unaware lets Mega Gyarados check common setup sweepers such as Primal Kyogre and Yveltal, even those with Power Trip, Stored Power, Sunsteel Strike, and Moongeist Beam. 0 Speed IVs ensure Mega Gyarados has the slowest possible U-turn and Spectral Thief. 44 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Mega Mewtwo Y at +2 after stealing its boosts with Spectral Thief. A Relaxed nature is used to patch up Mega Gyarados’s lower physical bulk, allowing it to survive at least 2 Facades from Regigigas and a +6 Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike, as well as win Spectral Thief wars by attacking after the foe. Alternatively, a Sassy nature can be used so Mega Gyarados can better check specially offensive Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Primal Kyogre.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>A resistance to Moongeist Beam, Sunsteel Strike, Stored Power, and Power Trip helps Mega Gyarados check setup sweepers such as Yveltal and Necrozma-DM, which can be vital because these moves prevent walls such as Fur Coat Chansey or RegenVest users from walling them. Therefore, make sure Mega Gyarados stays healthy if a setup sweeper still exists in the opposing team. Scout for Fairy- and Fighting-type coverage from Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Primal Kyogre. Be wary of strong physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X, Pheromosa, and Mega Garchomp, as they can deal massive damage even unboosted. Mega Gyarados should be careful when switching into defensive threats due to its vulnerability to Knock Off and common pivoting moves that allow the foe to gain momentum while dealing a lot of damage, and it can be weakened rather quickly from switching into strong attacks repeatedly, allowing setup sweepers to break through it. It can be used to bring in wallbreakers that require slow momentum support with U-turn. Knock Off should be used to remove items such as Eviolite from Chansey and Safety Goggles or Leftovers from defensive Pokemon to allow teammates to break through them with more ease. If not checking setup sweepers, use Knock Off to remove items or U-turn to gain a free switch. Keep entry hazards off the field, as they chip down Mega Gyarados fairly quickly, forcing it to repeatedly use its healing move and making it unable to check setup sweepers effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Gyarados works well on teams that are weak to setup sweepers and is an option over Prankster Haze users or other Unaware Pokemon. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Defog Giratina and Rapid Spin Necrozma-DM is useful, as Mega Gyarados is easily weakened by constantly switching into entry hazards, allowing the foe to break through it more easily. Imposter users such as Chansey can be used to scout for super effective coverage from Pokemon such as Fleur Cannon Mega Mewtwo Y and Secret Sword Mega Gengar. Magic Bounce users such as Registeel and Giratina are useful for pressuring non-Mold Breaker hazard setters or status effects targeted at Mega Gyarados. As Mega Gyarados helps Imposter-proof setup sweepers on its own team by stealing their boosts, setup sweepers that are not able to Imposter-proof themselves such as Mega Mewtwo Y can take advantage of having Mega Gyarados as a partner. A good physical tank alongside Mega Gyarados such as Zygarde-C or Giratina is a good option, as it can help Mega Gyarados with taking physical hits from the likes of Mega Mewtwo X and Regigigas. Status absorbers such as Poison Heal or Magic Bounce users help Mega Gyarados with status effects. Steel-types such as Solgaleo, Registeel, and Aegislash can help Mega Gyarados with its Fairy-type weakness as well as with -ate users, and Aegislash in particular can help with Mega Gyarados's Fighting-type weakness. If the team is particularly weak to certain physical setup sweepers such as Mega Mewtwo X, another way of stopping setup such as Prankster Haze Zygarde-C or Registeel will be useful. Pokemon able to set up entry hazards are very useful, as Mega Gyarados forces a lot of switches once the opponent knows it is running Unaware.</p>"

      "Poison Heal Setup": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear and Shell Smash boost Mega Gyarados's Attack and Speed, making it a threatening sweeper; while Shell Smash gives a greater boost to Mega Gyarados's Attack, it also lowers defenses. Coil can be used to increase Attack, accuracy, and Defense, allowing Crabhammer or Icicle Crash to hit consistently and letting Mega Gyarados take hits from physical attackers such as Regigigas and Primal Groudon. Crabhammer is Mega Gyarados's most powerful physical STAB move and has a high chance for a critical hit, but Icicle Crash can be used to threaten common physically defensive Pokemon such as Zygarde-C as well as hit Primal Groudon under harsh sunlight. Knock Off is important for removing items like Eviolite from Imposter users and Leftovers from defensive Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Mega Audino and is usually used with Shift Gear, while Power Trip is a more offensive option used with Shell Smash or Coil, allowing Mega Gyarados to sweep or wallbreak, respectively. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple Shedinja and Imposter users trying to come in on Mega Gyarados as well as physical attackers that may try to switch in on Mega Gyarados. Spore can be used to put Imposter users and defensive checks to sleep, giving Mega Gyarados more opportunities to set up or wallbreak. It is also able to take advantage of Knock Off removing Safety Goggles and cannot be reflected by Magic Bounce due to Poison Heal. Sunsteel Strike can be used to hit Shedinja, hit Fairy-types such as Mega Diancie and Mega Audino for super effective damage, and break through Unaware users; however, a Water-type STAB move is usually preferred, as Sunsteel Strike provides only limited coverage and has rather low PP. Sacred Fire is an alternative to Will-O-Wisp to burn Shedinja and Imposter users in order to be not affected by Taunt, although it is generally a rather shaky option, as it has significantly less PP and has a chance to not burn the aforementioned targets. Spiky Shield can be used to chip down -ate users trying to revenge kill Mega Gyarados, KO non-Protective Pads Shedinja if it tries to wall Mega Gyarados, and scout for surprise super effective moves from Pokemon such as Dialga and Mega Mewtwo Y. King's Shield is another alternative that lowers the Attack of -ate priority users to prevent them from revenge killing Mega Gyarados, although it is mostly used for sets with Shell Smash and Shift Gear. Both of these shield moves allow Mega Gyarados to recover more health. However, an important utility move must be forgone, which may cripple common physical threats or give Mega Gyarados fewer opportunities to set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Toxic Orb is mandatory for Mega Gyarados to activate Poison Heal. Poison Heal improves Mega Gyarados's longevity, prevents it from being statused, and Imposter-proofs it. It also allows Mega Gyarados to use Will-O-Wisp or Spore without fearing Magic Bounce. An Adamant nature with maximum Attack investment ensures Mega Gyarados hits as hard as possible, allowing it to 2HKO Mega Mewtwo X, Xerneas, and Mega Audino. 0 Speed investment with a Brave nature can be used on Coil sets to move after most Spectral Thief or Core Enforcer users, allowing Mega Gyarados to set up more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Gyarados should try to activate Toxic Orb as soon as possible, as Knock Off or any status effects aside from Toxic will leave it with no recovery. Switching in through slow VoltTurn allows it to do so safely as well as take minimal damage before setting up. Do not set up Mega Gyarados before -ate users such as Pixilate Mega Diancie and Galvanize Zekrom have been eliminated, as they can easily revenge kill it. Try to cripple opposing Shedinja on the switch with Will-O-Wisp, as this can help Mega Gyarados's sweep without being revenge killed. If Mega Gyarados is not running Sunsteel Strike or Will-O-Wisp, its teammates should lure out and weaken Shedinja as well as Prankster, Unaware, or Fur Coat users such as Mega Audino and Zygarde-C, as they are able to wall Mega Gyarados even if it sets up. If Mega Gyarados is not running Ice-type coverage, Zygarde-C should be eliminated. Although Mega Gyarados is able to set up against most defensive threats, it should be aware of Spectral Thief and Core Enforcer. Mega Gyarados should try to cripple physical attackers trying to switch in with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>-ate users such as Mega Diancie and Zekrom revenge kill Mega Gyarados very easily, so Pokemon that can deal with them such as RegenVest Dialga, Soundproof Zygarde-C, and Primal Groudon are good teammates. Checks to Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Aegislash, Mega Slowbro, and Magearna are useful, and they are also able to lure in Steel-types and give Mega Gyarados an opening to set up. Slow pivots such as Aegislash, Mega Audino, and Giratina can safely allow Mega Gyarados to come on the field and set up. Entry hazards setters are good partners to get rid of Shedinja, break potential Focus Sashes, and allow Mega Gyarados to get KOs more easily. Powerful special wallbreakers such as Tinted Lens Mega Mewtwo Y and Refrigerate Kyurem-W can break through physical Unaware walls such as Zygarde-C and Mega Audino, which Mega Gyarados struggles against even with Sunsteel Strike. Pokemon immune to Spectral Thief such as Mega Audino and Arceus are useful to scout for it, and Imposter users such as Chansey can scout for super effective moves from Mega Mewtwo Y and Primal Kyogre, Unaware users such as Primal Kyogre and Zygarde-C, and utility moves such as Core Enforcer and Spectral Thief so as to better prepare for Mega Gyarados's sweep. Fairy-types that resist Fighting such as Xerneas and Tapu Fini can help Mega Gyarados keep Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo X and Pheromosa in check and help take Core Enforcer users and defensive Dragon-types like Giratina and Zygarde-C on.</p>"

  "Mewtwo": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Mewtwo Y excels at breaking through defensive and offensive Pokemon alike thanks to its amazing mixed attacking stats and near-unmatched Speed stat. Other offensive Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Gengar are outsped and OHKOed or severely damaged by its attacks, while defensive Pokemon like Zygarde-C, Primal Kyogre, and Celesteela can also be broken through or even OHKOed by some Mega Mewtwo Y sets. Mega Mewtwo Y also has decent bulk and is good at tanking even strong neutral hits, like Boomburst from Pixilate Mega Diancie and Z-Thousand Waves from Zygarde-C, and weaker special hits like Giratina's Core Enforcer do minor damage. That being said, Mega Mewtwo Y struggles due to its offensively poor Psychic typing, which is resisted by several common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Yveltal, Registeel, and Necrozma-DM. This forces it to rely on coverage moves to threaten teams, meaning that Mega Mewtwo Y will often not be hitting as hard as its stats may suggest compared to Pokemon with better STAB types like Mega Gengar, Kartana, and Mega Garchomp. Mega Mewtwo Y's Psychic typing and reliance on coverage moves can also turn Imposter users into an annoyingly bulky hurdle for it, especially considering its good special bulk. Mega Mewtwo Y can be chipped very easily, considering its weaknesses to common moves like U-turn, Spectral Thief, and Knock Off. Lastly, its physical bulk leaves something to be desired, succumbing to priority users like Mega Diance, naturally faster threats like Mega Beedrill, and bulky attackers like Regigigas.</p> <p>With an incredible stat spread, a fantastic STAB combination, and a good Speed tier, Mega Mewtwo X finds itself as one of the most threatening offensive Pokemon in Balanced Hackmons. Due to its Fighting STAB and high Attack stat, Mega Mewtwo X can pressure Normal-, Steel-, and Dark-types, while its Psychic-type STAB makes Mega Mewtwo X an effective user of Photon Geyser, a powerful move that allows it to get past would-be checks such as Sturdy Shedinja and Fur Coat or Unaware Pokemon. These two types complement each other well, as Pokemon that resist Psychic often don't resist Fighting and vice versa, limiting viable answers to its STAB combination to Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Sableye, and Cresselia. Also, with a good Special Attack stat, it can bypass Pokemon that wall physical attackers, such as Fur Coat Pokemon, Zygarde-C and Mega Slowbro, and with its decent bulk it can take neutral STAB attacks in a pinch. For instance, it has the bulk to take Kyurem-B's Extreme Speed, Regigigas's Facade, and Dialga's Core Enforcer. Finally, its high Speed stat in conjunction with its typing allows it to force out or eliminate many Pokemon, including Kartana, Regigigas, Arceus, and Registeel. However, Mega Mewtwo X is still limited by its weaknesses to Flying- and Fairy-type attacks, making it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Mega Diancie, which is very common. Also, it Speed ties with Mega Gengar and is outsped by Mega Mewtwo Y, giving it quite a list of offensive checks. Meanwhile, defensively, though Mega Mewtwo X has few checks in general, Pokemon that do check it such as Mega Sableye, Giratina, and Cresselia consistently do so, as they either resist or are immune to its STAB moves. Also, Mega Mewtwo X can often be OHKOed by slower offensive threats that it cannot OHKO, such as Primal Groudon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y with Adaptability or Tinted Lens is great at breaking holes in teams, but it suffers from Psycho Boost instantly giving up momentum with the Special Attack drop, its STAB coverage being mediocre and having an immunity, and Imposter users being able to switch in multiple times. Setup moves on Mega Mewtwo Y like Tail Glow, Shell Smash, and Quiver Dance are viable, but Mega Mewtwo Y loses to Prankster Haze and any turns used setting up are typically better suited to attacking. No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y with moves like Zap Cannon, Blizzard, Magma Storm, Inferno, Sing, and Focus Blast is a powerful disruptor that can even force in and status Imposter, but it can typically only come in once due to its low power and lack of recovery. Also, it is countered by Poison Heal Xerneas. Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y can use sets not intended to KO the entire metagame but instead cover a specific set of Pokemon without letting in dangerous foes. Such sets are extremely customizable and use moves like entry hazards, Seed Flare, Sludge Wave, Shadow Ball, and Knock Off alongside the already listed moves. These sets are Imposter-proofed very easily and almost never seen coming, but they can be rendered useless if the opponent knows what they do. Focus Sash can be used on Magic Guard Mega Mewtwo Y to provide an emergency check to sweepers on an offensive team. This set typically uses Photon Geyser in order to not lose to Shedinja, because without a Life Orb, Psystrike fails to beat its intended targets. This set is relatively weak and usually more utility-focused, but can be worth it on specific teams. Similarly, Dazzling Mega Mewtwo Y can be used as a lure for priority users, and potentially get a KO on a defensive Pokemon with Z-Moves. However, this set is easily countered and worn down and other Dazzling users like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Gengar are typically better.</p> <p>An Adamant nature can be used on the main set to have a chance at OHKOing Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock with Close Combat, 2HKO Zygarde-C after Leftovers. A Naughty nature can be used on the Technician set to 2HKO Fur Coat Primal Kyogre. However, Mega Mewtwo X enjoys having maximum Speed, which these natures do not give. Mega Mewtwo X can run a set with Refrigerate or Pixilate for the priority, defeating its common checks and also beating Zygarde-C and Giratina. However, Mega Mewtwo X generally does not need the priority, and its main sets are powerful enough that an -ate set only helps against other -ate users. Tinted Lens can be run over Adaptability in order to be able to use STAB options more freely. However, the power loss from Adaptability is noticeable, as without it, Mega Mewtwo X cannot 2HKO Zygarde-C or Giratina, and Mega Mewtwo X is still checked by Pokemon immune to its STAB moves. Mega Mewtwo X can run a Poison Heal set with Low Kick, Will-O-Wisp, Knock Off, and Leech Seed to function as a check to boosted Regigigas as well as prevent it from being statused easily. However, a Poison Heal set sorely misses out on the power that other sets provide via ability, item, or both. Mega Mewtwo X can run a Shell Smash set with Dazzling to lure -ate users that may try to revenge kill Mega Mewtwo X while also breaking down physical walls such as Zygarde-C and Giratina with Stored Power. However, this set fares poorly against Unaware and Spectral Thief users, so it is often very risky to use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Imposter</strong>: Imposter Chansey can't hope to invalidate Mega Mewtwo Y over a longer game if it isn't allowed to recover, but it can completely stop all Mega Mewtwo Y variants except Poison Heal and the rare No Guard in the short term, and if allowed to recover through Shed Shell or careless Imposter-proofing, it can force the Mega Mewtwo Y user into easily exploitable aggressive play. Imposter also switches in on most of Mega Mewtwo X's attacks and easily forces it out. However, it must be wary of a Poison Heal set, as they are generally self Imposter proof.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Normal-types like Poison Heal Regigigas, Slaking, Arceus, and Normalize Normal-types can check Mega Mewtwo Y relatively well. They cannot be OHKOed by any move bar Sheer Force Focus Blast, and they OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y in return with +1 Facade or Normalize V-create.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Shedinja</strong>: Sturdy Shedinja can wall several Mega Mewtwo Y sets, including Sheer Force, Magic Guard lacking Moongeist Beam, and Poison Heal lacking Will-O-Wisp, with Knock Off Magic Guard and Stealth Rock Poison Heal being more neutral matchups. All Mega Mewtwo Y teams need solid counterplay to this Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Pivoting</strong>: Teams that use slow pivoting can deny Mega Mewtwo Y opportunities to come in and do incredibly well against bulkier teams that rely on Mega Mewtwo Y to make progress. Mega Mewtwo Y teams must use secondary proactive Pokemon like Poison Heal users to not lose to these teams. Fast pivots like Mega Beedrill and Pheromosa deserve a mention too; while they are unable to switch in, they can take advantage of Mega Mewtwo Y being in by threatening to OHKO it while potentially gaining momentum through U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Fast Attacks</strong>: Mega Mewtwo Y is naturally frail and thus unable to stand up to priority -ate ability users like Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B as well as naturally faster threats like Mega Beedrill, Pheromosa, Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf users.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit from Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar, RegenVest Yveltal, and Normalize Regigigas severely threatens Mega Mewtwo Y, either KOing it or heavily chipping away at its health.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Cresselia and Fur Coat Chansey are not threatened by Mega Mewtwo Y's coverage options, and thus will pester Mega Mewtwo Y or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis from Pokemon like Registeel and Mega Audino and burns from Pokemon like Giratina, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh can shut down the offensive capabilities of Mega Mewtwo Y, essentially removing it as a notable factor in the game.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Mega Diancie can revenge kill Mega Mewtwo X with its -ate sets. However, it must be wary of Dazzling. In addition to -ate sets, Triage Mega Charizard Y can revenge kill Mega Mewtwo X with less fear of an -ate set, but must still be wary of Dazzling.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Defensive Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Mega Slowbro can wall Mega Mewtwo X's main sets. They must be wary of Dark-or Ghost-type coverage, such as Knock Off or Spectral Thief, however. Knock Off does tend to do reduced damage after the item is lost, though, so it is easier to handle.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: With their high bulk in conjunction with their typings, Mega Sableye, Aegislash, and Giratina can check Mega Mewtwo X's Adaptability set. However, the former two must be wary of Technician, while Giratina must be wary of Photon Geyser on the Adaptability set, as it will get 2HKOed. All Ghost-types must also be wary of Knock Off and Spectral Thief, but Knock Off still does reduced damage after the first use so it's more manageable than Spectral Thief.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Mega Sableye is immune to both of Mega Mewtwo X's STAB moves, making it a viable option to check Mega Mewtwo X with Poison Heal in order to ensure it doesn't get worn down too quickly. However, it must be wary of any coverage move, as Mega Sableye can only sufficiently check Mega Mewtwo X sets that have no way to hurt it, which is very rare. Fur Coat Yveltal can check Adaptability sets, but requires Leftovers to do so and cannot take chip damage.</p>",

      "Sheer Force Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bolt Strike allows Mega Mewtwo Y to OHKO popular Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre while also hitting Imposter users and opposing Mega Mewtwo Y for good damage. Ice Beam and Moonblast complement Bolt Strike by hitting the Dragon-types that resist it, with Ice Beam used for OHKOing Zygarde-C and Moonblast for hitting Mega Mewtwo X for at least 90% of its health. Earth Power and Focus Blast are used to beat Steel-types. Earth Power is the more reliable option and doesn't leave Mega Mewtwo Y walled by any additional Pokemon outside of the uncommon and easily pressured Fur Coat Chansey. The extra damage from Focus Blast can be useful against Steel-types like Registeel, and it hits Arceus harder than Psychic, but it leaves Mega Mewtwo Y walled by Necrozma-DM, Aegislash, and Solgaleo, and its low accuracy can be a huge disadvantage. Psychic is used in the last slot as a generally powerful attack to catch Pokemon not weak to Mega Mewtwo Y's other moves, like Mega Mewtwo X for Ice Beam variants, and Mega Audino and Arceus for Earth Power variants. Stealth Rock can punish switches and give the team good Shedinja counterplay, but makes Imposter-proofing a pain due to the general passivity of Magic Bounce users. Blue Flare can be run in order to smash non-Flash Fire Steel-type Pokemon like Registeel. Tail Glow can also be run instead of Bolt Strike in order to turn Mega Mewtwo Y into a late-game sweeper, boosting its Special Attack to disgustingly high levels.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Hasty improves Mega Mewtwo Y's matchup against special attacks like Triage Oblivion Wing from Yveltal while also increasing the amount of damage Imposter takes from Bolt Strike. However, Naive is also an option if Imposter users are sufficiently covered and Mega Mewtwo Y is intended to be used early-game, as it slightly lowers the amount of chip damage Mega Mewtwo Y will take from common physical attacks like U-turn and Anchor Shot. Life Orb and Sheer Force make for a great combination, offering a 1.69x boost on all moves with secondary effects without any drawbacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Mewtwo Y will likely have several opportunities to come in, and in many matchups, your gameplan will revolve around bringing it in at the right times. There is always a cost to bringing Mega Mewtwo Y in, so it shouldn't be brought into play unless there is sufficient reason to do so. For example, if Mega Mewtwo Y threatens an annoying Pokemon that your team doesn't have stable counterplay to, it should be brought in on a sooner opportunity if possible. If there are opposing Pokemon that can completely shut Mega Mewtwo Y down, like Shedinja and Imposter users that are hard to punish, then it should not be brought out at all unless these Pokemon have been taken care of, or as part of a bluff to escape a dangerous situation. Mega Mewtwo Y is a viable win condition and bringing it in to clean up after important Pokemon have been weakened or KOed is a good plan in many matchups, but in some situations, trading its late-game potential to punch a hole in the opposing team is the better strategy. Chip damage severely limits what Mega Mewtwo Y can do later on. For example, Mega Mewtwo Y is limited to firing off a few attacks at most against a potentially very healthy team if it gets poisoned. For this reason, it should be kept away from entry hazards and status-inducing moves if possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Poison Heal Xerneas pairs extremely well with this Mega Mewtwo Y set, because in addition to offensively complementing it against foes it struggles to beat like Shedinja and Chansey, it is also very difficult to wear down and can be directly switched into many defensive Pokemon, making progress against them without incurring any significant damage. Xerneas also can set up Spikes for Mega Mewtwo Y, which aids in its sweeping capabilities while preventing Shedinja from entering the battle to stop Mega Mewtwo Y. Lastly, Xerneas can also aid Mega Mewtwo Y by absorbing Knock Off and status moves, which threaten Mega Mewtwo Y's longevity. In return, Mega Mewtwo Y can brute force its way through common Xerneas checks like Ho-Oh. Other Fairy-types like Magearna, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Fini are also strong partners for similar reasons. Magearna can be worn down by entry hazards and Pokemon like Primal Kyogre, but offers resistances to common types such as Flying and Rock over Xerneas. Mega Diancie is a strong entry hazard setter that can cover the Pokemon Mega Mewtwo Y struggles against, typically running sets like Magic Guard and Pixilate V-create when paired with it to OHKO Pokemon like RegenVest Registeel and Giratina. Its poor longevity works against it, however. Tapu Fini works differently from these other Pokemon due to its lower attacking stats limiting its ability to OHKO or 2HKO opposing Pokemon. However, it is extremely hard to wear down and can take advantage of more passive playstyles through moves like Taunt and Scald. Mega Beedrill can take care of Mega Mewtwo X and other Psychic-types, and is also able to force out Imposter users lacking Choice Scarf. Defensively checking Imposter users can be done with reasonably bulky Pokemon not weak to any of Mega Mewtwo Y's attacks. Examples include Arceus, Sturdy Shedinja, and Cresselia. That said, as long as Bolt Strike from Imposter is punishable and important Electric-type resistances can be feasibly kept healthy, a dedicated Imposter-proofer is not always needed. Pursuit trappers like Mega Tyranitar can be used to handle Pokemon like Chansey and Cresselia and to chip Giratina into KO range of Ice Beam. Mold Breaker Pursuit users like Mega Gengar can also help with handling Shedinja.</p>"

      "Magic Guard Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Light of Ruin OHKOes Mega Mewtwo X, KOes Dark-types like Yveltal and Mega Tyranitar after slight chip damage, and heavily damages Dragon-types like Giratina. Volt Tackle hits Flash Fire Celesteela, Ho-Oh, and Primal Kyogre for big damage, meaning they cannot switch into Light of Ruin and tank the following hit. Psystrike is more powerful against other targets thanks to STAB and also KOes Mega Venusaur, but it misses out on Celesteela and isn't that much stronger than Light of Ruin. Mind Blown is Mega Mewtwo Y's strongest attack against Steel-types and can KO them from very high HP, but misses out on Flash Fire Steel-types. Precipice Blades provides great coverage against Steel-types and perfect coverage with Volt Tackle outside of Ferrothorn. It also hits Red Orb Groudon for big damage. High Jump Kick hits Normal-types like Regigigas, Chansey, and Arceus, but misses out on Necrozma-DM, Aegislash, and Solgaleo. Moongeist Beam takes out Sturdy Shedinja and Psychic-types like Cresselia and does lots of damage to Imposter users on the switch. Knock Off removes Fur Coat Chansey's Eviolite, Shedinja's Protective Pads, and Assault Vest from Giratina and Zygarde-C, opening them up for both Mega Mewtwo Y and its teammates. It's also good at deterring Imposter Chansey from switching in. Strength Sap gives Mega Mewtwo Y some extra longevity, but hinders its wallbreaking potential and requires a dedicated Imposter-proofer to block it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magic Guard allows for the unrestricted use of high-powered attacks like Light of Ruin, Mind Blown, Volt Tackle, and High Jump Kick. It also protects Mega Mewtwo Y from chip damage through entry hazards, status, and Life Orb. Life Orb has no drawbacks and helps Mega Mewtwo Y get KOs it would otherwise miss. This set uses a Naive nature to stave off chip damage from U-turn, Spectral Thief, and trapping moves. Imposter can be hit for big damage through Light of Ruin or Moongeist Beam, while opposing special moves like Primal Kyogre's Revelation Dance deal underwhelming damage anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Mega Mewtwo Y set works best as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker to constantly push forward and force the opponent to find a solid answer to it, which they may not have. This set is much less restricted in its coverage moves, so bluffing options you don't have can help Mega Mewtwo Y make progress. For example, Mega Mewtwo Y can bluff Psystrike to deter an opposing Mega Venusaur from coming in. Additionally, many teams are simply unprepared for this set and are harshly punished every time it comes in. If this is true, your gameplan should revolve around finding opportunities for Mega Mewtwo Y to come in. Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo X can be extremely limited in what they can do if Mega Mewtwo Y immediately puts them into a disadvantageous position. Be wary of lures like Prankster Destiny Bond if Mega Mewtwo Y has the potential to get more than a one-for-one trade. Mega Mewtwo Y can be directly switched into weak attacks and Pokemon that are forced to recover or brought in through double switches. It should typically be brought in on a Pokemon in KO range, or against one that takes big damage and cannot retaliate like more defensive sets of Celesteela, Zygarde-C, and Fur Coat Chansey. Beware of ability suppression through Core Enforcer, Worry Seed, and similar moves, as it will cause Mega Mewtwo Y to take recoil damage. If you have momentum during the battle, switching out Mega Mewtwo Y if you predict your opponent to be intimidated by it can extend your advantageous position and give you more progress than you could otherwise get. For example, directly switching a 3 attacks Poison Heal Xerneas into a Giratina that is in Light of Ruin KO range can catch an opponent trying to preserve resources. Be wary against Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Poison Heal Xerneas, which can threaten to paralyze Mega Mewtwo Y. While Mega Mewtwo Y may be able to beat them, the paralysis will usually be disastrous in the long run. Additionally, Mega Mewtwo Y's Life Orb is important and should be preserved if possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ice-types like Kyurem-B and Kyurem-W synergize well with Mega Mewtwo Y, creating advantageous game states by coming in on Pokemon like Giratina and Zygarde-C, and pressing the existing advantage started by Mega Mewtwo Y. These Pokemon are extremely dangerous given opportunities to come in and are also good at breaking down already weakened teams. Slow U-turn pivots are good at giving Mega Mewtwo Y opportunities to come in. RegenVest Zygarde-C, Magearna, and Sturdy Shedinja are good for this role. Poison Heal users can get initiative through coming in on walls that are sent out to face Mega Mewtwo Y, setting entry hazards, and forcing in certain Pokemon to counter them. Examples include Slaking, Regigigas, Arceus, Xerneas, and Primal Kyogre. Imposter can be beaten with different Pokemon depending on what moves are chosen. For example, variants lacking Precipice Blades can be Imposter-proofed by Primal Groudon, and variants lacking High Jump Kick can be Imposter-proofed by Normal-types like Poison Heal and Prankster Arceus. Imposter Pokemon like Chansey can also aid Mega Mewtwo Y by checking threats to it while countering RegenVest Pokemon like Dialga and Cresselia.</p>"

      "Poison Heal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psystrike is the move the set is built around because Poison Heal Mega Mewtwo Y doesn't have a boosting ability or item for its coverage moves. It is Mega Mewtwo Y's main method of threatening opposing Pokemon alongside coverage moves. Taunt shuts down lots of Pokemon, including most Prankster users, Poison Heal users that focus on setting entry hazards, passive Pokemon lacking Magic Bounce like Flash Fire and Fur Coat users, and even Shell Smash users like Mega Mewtwo X and Power Trip Dark-types. Moonblast wears down Dark-types and hits Giratina and Zygarde-C for more damage than Psystrike. Mega Mewtwo Y cannot beat these Pokemon without prior damage, but with Moonblast it does not cede momentum to them. Additionally, Mega Mewtwo Y has a good chance of neutering Imposter users through Special Attack drops if it is healthy. Ice Beam gives up the matchup against Dark-types, bar Yveltal, in favor of almost OHKOing Zygarde-C and forcing out Rayquaza and Mega Garchomp. Earth Power 2HKOes Red Orb Groudon and vastly improves matchups against Steel-types. Will-O-Wisp is incredible against the myriad Pokemon that rely on physical attacks, like U-turn users, trappers, and physical attackers including Mega Mewtwo X, Kartana, and Mega Garchomp. The chip damage it provides can also be very helpful in limiting the opponent's initiative as well as taking out Sturdy Shedinja. Stealth Rock allows Mega Mewtwo Y to act as an entry hazard setter. This cuts into the amount of Pokemon it can check, but makes it very dangerous against unprepared teams that rely on entry hazard removers that lose to it. However, giving up the benefits of the other two options is a big commitment.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Poison Heal alongside Toxic Orb turns Mega Mewtwo Y into a disruptor that can be extremely hard to wear down. The constant recovery means that Mega Mewtwo Y can recover from even very low health given the opportunity, and the status immunity blocks several things that would shut down other Mega Mewtwo Y sets, especially paralysis. This Mega Mewtwo Y set uses a Timid nature because outspeeding Mega Gengar is extremely important.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can be dangerous to both offensive and defensive teams given the opportunity, so it should never be completely counted out on team preview. Against hyper offensive teams, fight for a situation where Mega Mewtwo Y can land Taunt on a Shell Smash user. Work from this advantage and force them to trade away Pokemon to regain their momentum. Keep Mega Mewtwo Y intact afterwards if you can, because these teams typically rely on a Shell Smash sweeper to clean up late-game. Sacrifice Pokemon that are less useful in the matchup to allow Mega Mewtwo Y more chances to come in and prevent Pokemon from setting up. In other matchups, Mega Mewtwo Y is typically best used to extend an already existing advantageous game state instead of seizing it for itself; the exception to this is against Pokemon that get OHKOed by Mega Mewtwo Y like Mega Gengar. The more weakened the opposing team is, the more dangerous Mega Mewtwo Y becomes. It can still make progress early-game, but should be used in combination with more powerful Pokemon during this phase. Most solid teams will have Pokemon that match up poorly against Mega Mewtwo Y. In the likely situation that the opponent doesn't have a counter to it that completely shifts momentum in their favor, Mega Mewtwo Y can ruthlessly exploit these Pokemon when they are forced in, constantly making progress until the opposing team begins to crumble. Unless making progress with Mega Mewtwo Y is an unfeasible plan due to irremovable counters, status shutting it down before Toxic Orb activates, or other Pokemon being more necessary in a situation where a Pokemon has to be sacrificed, Mega Mewtwo Y's longevity should be used to its advantage. Try to keep it healthy, because its HP is very important in determining what it can beat. Mega Mewtwo Y is near worthless if its Toxic Orb can't activate because of status moves or Knock Off. Be wary of these before bringing it in for the first time. Getting Mega Mewtwo Y in through U-turn, double switching, or hard switching out of Imposter is always safer than leading with it or revenge killing a Pokemon outside of KO range. Mega Mewtwo Y appreciates being brought in by slow pivots such as Zygarde-C and Shedinja in order to gain back HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Imposter Chansey is an incredible partner for this set, because in addition to scouting out foes to determine which ones are bait for Mega Mewtwo Y and forming a powerful anti-offense core with it, it can also shut down the initiative of teams that use RegenVest Pokemon. RegenVest users like Registeel, Magearna, and Yveltal are incredibly annoying for Mega Mewtwo Y because they are very difficult to chip, can recover in spite of Taunt, and take reduced damage from all attacks except Psystrike, so having a counter to them is very useful to prevent a one-sided matchup. Dedicated entry hazard removers like Magic Bounce users and -ate Rapid Spin on Pokemon like Magearna, Zygarde-C, Ho-Oh, and Xerneas can potentially gain initiative through their lack of passivity, form a decent offensive and supportive core with Mega Mewtwo Y, and block hazards, preventing opponents from restricting Mega Mewtwo Y's movement. These Pokemon can also cover Imposter users when Mega Mewtwo Y is using Will-O-Wisp or Stealth Rock. Sturdy Shedinja also synergizes well with Imposter and entry hazard removers, and allows for more flexible and unpredictable play with Mega Mewtwo Y thanks to its pivoting abilities. It can also assist in breaking down teams and Imposter-proof Earth Power variants of Mega Mewtwo Y. Wallbreakers that have a good matchup against Giratina are great at helping Mega Mewtwo Y make progress in the game. These typically come in the form of Pixilate and Refrigerate users like Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, Xerneas, Mega Mewtwo X, and Kyurem-W, but other options are also viable. For example, Mega Mewtwo Y can pair up with Poison Heal Xerneas to form a formidable double Poison Heal core. Knock Off support is a big help for Mega Mewtwo Y primarily due to removing Assault Vest and limiting Sturdy Shedinja. Try to fit this move somewhere on the team on a Pokemon that draws in these threats. The aforementioned Poison Heal Xerneas or even Pixilate Mega Diancie can use this option viably.</p>"

  "Mewtwo-Mega-X": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Mewtwo Y excels at breaking through defensive and offensive Pokemon alike thanks to its amazing mixed attacking stats and near-unmatched Speed stat. Other offensive Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Gengar are outsped and OHKOed or severely damaged by its attacks, while defensive Pokemon like Zygarde-C, Primal Kyogre, and Celesteela can also be broken through or even OHKOed by some Mega Mewtwo Y sets. Mega Mewtwo Y also has decent bulk and is good at tanking even strong neutral hits, like Boomburst from Pixilate Mega Diancie and Z-Thousand Waves from Zygarde-C, and weaker special hits like Giratina's Core Enforcer do minor damage. That being said, Mega Mewtwo Y struggles due to its offensively poor Psychic typing, which is resisted by several common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Yveltal, Registeel, and Necrozma-DM. This forces it to rely on coverage moves to threaten teams, meaning that Mega Mewtwo Y will often not be hitting as hard as its stats may suggest compared to Pokemon with better STAB types like Mega Gengar, Kartana, and Mega Garchomp. Mega Mewtwo Y's Psychic typing and reliance on coverage moves can also turn Imposter users into an annoyingly bulky hurdle for it, especially considering its good special bulk. Mega Mewtwo Y can be chipped very easily, considering its weaknesses to common moves like U-turn, Spectral Thief, and Knock Off. Lastly, its physical bulk leaves something to be desired, succumbing to priority users like Mega Diance, naturally faster threats like Mega Beedrill, and bulky attackers like Regigigas.</p> <p>With an incredible stat spread, a fantastic STAB combination, and a good Speed tier, Mega Mewtwo X finds itself as one of the most threatening offensive Pokemon in Balanced Hackmons. Due to its Fighting STAB and high Attack stat, Mega Mewtwo X can pressure Normal-, Steel-, and Dark-types, while its Psychic-type STAB makes Mega Mewtwo X an effective user of Photon Geyser, a powerful move that allows it to get past would-be checks such as Sturdy Shedinja and Fur Coat or Unaware Pokemon. These two types complement each other well, as Pokemon that resist Psychic often don't resist Fighting and vice versa, limiting viable answers to its STAB combination to Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro, Mega Sableye, and Cresselia. Also, with a good Special Attack stat, it can bypass Pokemon that wall physical attackers, such as Fur Coat Pokemon, Zygarde-C and Mega Slowbro, and with its decent bulk it can take neutral STAB attacks in a pinch. For instance, it has the bulk to take Kyurem-B's Extreme Speed, Regigigas's Facade, and Dialga's Core Enforcer. Finally, its high Speed stat in conjunction with its typing allows it to force out or eliminate many Pokemon, including Kartana, Regigigas, Arceus, and Registeel. However, Mega Mewtwo X is still limited by its weaknesses to Flying- and Fairy-type attacks, making it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Mega Diancie, which is very common. Also, it Speed ties with Mega Gengar and is outsped by Mega Mewtwo Y, giving it quite a list of offensive checks. Meanwhile, defensively, though Mega Mewtwo X has few checks in general, Pokemon that do check it such as Mega Sableye, Giratina, and Cresselia consistently do so, as they either resist or are immune to its STAB moves. Also, Mega Mewtwo X can often be OHKOed by slower offensive threats that it cannot OHKO, such as Primal Groudon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y with Adaptability or Tinted Lens is great at breaking holes in teams, but it suffers from Psycho Boost instantly giving up momentum with the Special Attack drop, its STAB coverage being mediocre and having an immunity, and Imposter users being able to switch in multiple times. Setup moves on Mega Mewtwo Y like Tail Glow, Shell Smash, and Quiver Dance are viable, but Mega Mewtwo Y loses to Prankster Haze and any turns used setting up are typically better suited to attacking. No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y with moves like Zap Cannon, Blizzard, Magma Storm, Inferno, Sing, and Focus Blast is a powerful disruptor that can even force in and status Imposter, but it can typically only come in once due to its low power and lack of recovery. Also, it is countered by Poison Heal Xerneas. Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y can use sets not intended to KO the entire metagame but instead cover a specific set of Pokemon without letting in dangerous foes. Such sets are extremely customizable and use moves like entry hazards, Seed Flare, Sludge Wave, Shadow Ball, and Knock Off alongside the already listed moves. These sets are Imposter-proofed very easily and almost never seen coming, but they can be rendered useless if the opponent knows what they do. Focus Sash can be used on Magic Guard Mega Mewtwo Y to provide an emergency check to sweepers on an offensive team. This set typically uses Photon Geyser in order to not lose to Shedinja, because without a Life Orb, Psystrike fails to beat its intended targets. This set is relatively weak and usually more utility-focused, but can be worth it on specific teams. Similarly, Dazzling Mega Mewtwo Y can be used as a lure for priority users, and potentially get a KO on a defensive Pokemon with Z-Moves. However, this set is easily countered and worn down and other Dazzling users like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Gengar are typically better.</p> <p>An Adamant nature can be used on the main set to have a chance at OHKOing Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock with Close Combat, 2HKO Zygarde-C after Leftovers. A Naughty nature can be used on the Technician set to 2HKO Fur Coat Primal Kyogre. However, Mega Mewtwo X enjoys having maximum Speed, which these natures do not give. Mega Mewtwo X can run a set with Refrigerate or Pixilate for the priority, defeating its common checks and also beating Zygarde-C and Giratina. However, Mega Mewtwo X generally does not need the priority, and its main sets are powerful enough that an -ate set only helps against other -ate users. Tinted Lens can be run over Adaptability in order to be able to use STAB options more freely. However, the power loss from Adaptability is noticeable, as without it, Mega Mewtwo X cannot 2HKO Zygarde-C or Giratina, and Mega Mewtwo X is still checked by Pokemon immune to its STAB moves. Mega Mewtwo X can run a Poison Heal set with Low Kick, Will-O-Wisp, Knock Off, and Leech Seed to function as a check to boosted Regigigas as well as prevent it from being statused easily. However, a Poison Heal set sorely misses out on the power that other sets provide via ability, item, or both. Mega Mewtwo X can run a Shell Smash set with Dazzling to lure -ate users that may try to revenge kill Mega Mewtwo X while also breaking down physical walls such as Zygarde-C and Giratina with Stored Power. However, this set fares poorly against Unaware and Spectral Thief users, so it is often very risky to use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Imposter</strong>: Imposter Chansey can't hope to invalidate Mega Mewtwo Y over a longer game if it isn't allowed to recover, but it can completely stop all Mega Mewtwo Y variants except Poison Heal and the rare No Guard in the short term, and if allowed to recover through Shed Shell or careless Imposter-proofing, it can force the Mega Mewtwo Y user into easily exploitable aggressive play. Imposter also switches in on most of Mega Mewtwo X's attacks and easily forces it out. However, it must be wary of a Poison Heal set, as they are generally self Imposter proof.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Normal-types like Poison Heal Regigigas, Slaking, Arceus, and Normalize Normal-types can check Mega Mewtwo Y relatively well. They cannot be OHKOed by any move bar Sheer Force Focus Blast, and they OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y in return with +1 Facade or Normalize V-create.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Shedinja</strong>: Sturdy Shedinja can wall several Mega Mewtwo Y sets, including Sheer Force, Magic Guard lacking Moongeist Beam, and Poison Heal lacking Will-O-Wisp, with Knock Off Magic Guard and Stealth Rock Poison Heal being more neutral matchups. All Mega Mewtwo Y teams need solid counterplay to this Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Pivoting</strong>: Teams that use slow pivoting can deny Mega Mewtwo Y opportunities to come in and do incredibly well against bulkier teams that rely on Mega Mewtwo Y to make progress. Mega Mewtwo Y teams must use secondary proactive Pokemon like Poison Heal users to not lose to these teams. Fast pivots like Mega Beedrill and Pheromosa deserve a mention too; while they are unable to switch in, they can take advantage of Mega Mewtwo Y being in by threatening to OHKO it while potentially gaining momentum through U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Fast Attacks</strong>: Mega Mewtwo Y is naturally frail and thus unable to stand up to priority -ate ability users like Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B as well as naturally faster threats like Mega Beedrill, Pheromosa, Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf users.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit from Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar, RegenVest Yveltal, and Normalize Regigigas severely threatens Mega Mewtwo Y, either KOing it or heavily chipping away at its health.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Cresselia and Fur Coat Chansey are not threatened by Mega Mewtwo Y's coverage options, and thus will pester Mega Mewtwo Y or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis from Pokemon like Registeel and Mega Audino and burns from Pokemon like Giratina, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh can shut down the offensive capabilities of Mega Mewtwo Y, essentially removing it as a notable factor in the game.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Mega Diancie can revenge kill Mega Mewtwo X with its -ate sets. However, it must be wary of Dazzling. In addition to -ate sets, Triage Mega Charizard Y can revenge kill Mega Mewtwo X with less fear of an -ate set, but must still be wary of Dazzling.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Defensive Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Mega Slowbro can wall Mega Mewtwo X's main sets. They must be wary of Dark-or Ghost-type coverage, such as Knock Off or Spectral Thief, however. Knock Off does tend to do reduced damage after the item is lost, though, so it is easier to handle.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: With their high bulk in conjunction with their typings, Mega Sableye, Aegislash, and Giratina can check Mega Mewtwo X's Adaptability set. However, the former two must be wary of Technician, while Giratina must be wary of Photon Geyser on the Adaptability set, as it will get 2HKOed. All Ghost-types must also be wary of Knock Off and Spectral Thief, but Knock Off still does reduced damage after the first use so it's more manageable than Spectral Thief.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Mega Sableye is immune to both of Mega Mewtwo X's STAB moves, making it a viable option to check Mega Mewtwo X with Poison Heal in order to ensure it doesn't get worn down too quickly. However, it must be wary of any coverage move, as Mega Sableye can only sufficiently check Mega Mewtwo X sets that have no way to hurt it, which is very rare. Fur Coat Yveltal can check Adaptability sets, but requires Leftovers to do so and cannot take chip damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Photon Geyser is the Psychic STAB move of choice, bypassing Fur Coat and Sturdy. With Adaptability, it 2HKOes Giratina and Mega Audino, as well as potentially 2HKOing Zygarde-C after Stealth Rock and potentially OHKOing Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock. Close Combat is the Fighting STAB move of choice, OHKOing Registeel, Kartana, and Primal Kyogre lacking Fur Coat and 2HKOing Zygarde-C lacking Fur Coat. It also functions as a way to beat Steel-types and Dark-types that don't mind being hit by Photon Geyser. Knock Off hits Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Mega Slowbro while also removing Leftovers from Pokemon to reduce their passive recovery. It can also be used to remove Plates from Judgment users, limiting their coverage; Choice items and Life Orbs from offensive Pokemon, neutering their power; and Safety Goggles, removing their Spore immunity. Spectral Thief is a more consistent option to hit Psychic-types, steal boosts from slower Pokemon that have stolen other boosts, and punish foes that may otherwise set up on Mega Mewtwo X, but Knock Off is preferred due to the added utility of removing items. U-turn can be used to gain momentum on the switches that Mega Mewtwo X forces while also dealing heavy damage to Psychic-types that may try to switch in. Trick can be used to lock defensive Pokemon into one move, crippling them if they need to use healing moves to check Mega Mewtwo X, while also giving Mega Mewtwo X the freedom to switch attacks again. However, Mega Mewtwo X generally prefers the power that is granted by Choice Band, so using Trick does come with a drawback. Finally, Ice Hammer can be used to OHKO Zygarde-C, but it is already 2HKOed by Mega Mewtwo X's STAB attacks, and running Ice Hammer leaves Mega Mewtwo X walled by Psychic-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band is used to boost Mega Mewtwo X's power alongside Adaptability so it can OHKO Primal Kyogre and 2HKO Mega Audino and Giratina. Adaptability boosts Photon Geyser and Close Combat, further increasing Mega Mewtwo X's power and turning it into a frightening wallbreaker. Tough Claws can be run over Adaptability, but it has the drawback of not boosting Photon Geyser, which is arguably the best move on the set. However, it can boost coverage moves such as Knock Off, Spectral Thief, U-turn, and Ice Hammer. A Jolly nature is used to maximize Speed without sacrificing Mega Mewtwo X's bulk and power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's important to conserve PP on Photon Geyser and Close Combat, as both moves have fairly low PP that can be stalled down by the opponent by using type immunities. Bring Mega Mewtwo X in on Pokemon it can threaten, such as Steel-types, Mega Tyranitar, and Kyurem-B. Be careful not to let Mega Mewtwo X's item get removed, as Choice Band is vital for its power. Scouting for Knock Off on Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar will help in assessing if Mega Mewtwo X can switch in on them. Scout for status on common users such as Registeel, Giratina, and Dialga to ensure that Mega Mewtwo X does not get burned or paralyzed, as it needs both its Speed and power to achieve the 2HKOs and OHKOs that make it good. Do not play Mega Mewtwo X recklessly; make sure you mainly bring it in with slow pivoting or double switches, as Mega Mewtwo X needs to remain healthy to defeat certain threats. Be wary of locking Mega Mewtwo X into Photon Geyser or Close Combat while Dark- or Ghost-types are on the opposing team, as much momentum will be lost if they switch in. Only use Trick when you no longer need Choice Band on Mega Mewtwo X or when the need for power is outweighed by the benefit of crippling a defensive Pokemon. Ensure that the opposing Pokemon is not holding items that cannot be Tricked, such as a Z-Crystal, or items that would cripple Mega Mewtwo X, such as Toxic Orbs from Poison Heal Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>An Imposter user such as Chansey can be used in order to see which Pokemon Mega Mewtwo X can come in on, while also checking to see if Mega Mewtwo X can safely revenge kill Mega Diancie. Stealth Rock support is also valuable to get damage on many of the switches that Mega Mewtwo X forces, such as against Registeel and Dialga, make walls easier to break down, and let Mega Mewtwo X get the potential 2HKO on Zygarde-C. Pokemon with -ate abilities such as Mega Diancie and Zekrom can take advantage of Mega Mewtwo X's ability to eliminate Steel-types. In return, they can beat Pokemon that check Mega Mewtwo X, such as Mega Slowbro and Mega Sableye, and Mega Diancie in particular can additionally eliminate Dark-types so Mega Mewtwo X can use Photon Geyser more freely. Mega Mewtwo X also appreciates checks to Pixilate and Aerilate users, such as Flash Fire Steel-types and Fur Coat Chansey. Checks to opposing Mega Mewtwo X, such as Imposter Chansey, Cresselia, and Mega Slowbro, are appreciated, as they can additionally Imposter-proof Mega Mewtwo X. Checks to Mega Gengar such as Yveltal and Mega Audino are good team options, as Mega Mewtwo X is forced out by Mega Gengar. Mega Mewtwo X appreciates entry hazard removal from common Defoggers such as Giratina, Mega Audino, and Zygarde-C, as Toxic Spikes can put it on a timer which Mega Mewtwo X cannot often afford. Finally, Mega Slowbro, Cresselia, and Mega Sableye can all Imposter-proof Mega Mewtwo X, while also providing safe opportunities to bring it in with slow pivoting.</p>"
      },
      "Technician": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Storm Throw is the Fighting-type STAB move of choice, doing considerable damage to almost anything that does not resist it thanks to the guaranteed critical hit as well as Technician's boost in power. In addition, Storm Throw's critical hit also lets Mega Mewtwo X ignore drops to its attack from King's Shield and boosts to the opponent's Defense, which helps it wallbreak more efficiently. Frost Breath rounds out the coverage, OHKOing Zygarde-C while also 2HKOing Giratina. By virtue of its guaranteed critical hit, Frost Breath can also ignore boosts to the opponent's Special Defense, which may be useful. Bonemerang is used to OHKO Aegislash and Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock while also breaking Substitutes and Focus Sash. Sunsteel Strike can be used to bypass Fur Coat, OHKO Shedinja, and 2HKO Mega Audino. Knock Off is used to remove items as well as hit Psychic-types such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Cresselia. Stealth Rock can be run, as Mega Mewtwo X forces out many common Magic Bounce Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Giratina. Spectral Thief is an option to more consistently hit Psychic-types while also stealing some boosts. Finally, Shell Smash can be run on this set to boost Mega Mewtwo X's offensive prowess, but it will often not need the boost in power and cannot often afford wasting a turn to set up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb allows Mega Mewtwo X to achieve the OHKO on Zygarde-C and Aegislash as well as the 2HKO on Mega Audino, Primal Groudon, and Giratina. Expert Belt can also be used to avoid recoil, as this set relies on super effective hits to do damage. However, the lower power does make a difference, as Mega Mewtwo X no longer reliably OHKOes Zygarde-C and no longer reliably 2HKOes Mega Audino. Technician is used to boost the power of Storm Throw and Frost Breath, allowing them to get key damage on their intended targets. A Naive nature is used to maximize Speed while maintaining power. Naive is preferred, as -ate Fake Out and Extreme Speed are a common way to revenge kill Mega Mewtwo X, so it cannot afford to lower its Defense stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Don't let Mega Mewtwo X take unnecessary damage. As Mega Mewtwo X runs Life Orb, it is already on a timer, and adding damage onto that can hurt Mega Mewtwo X's potential in the match. Don't let Mega Mewtwo X get statused by common users such as Aegislash, Mega Audino, and Dialga, as poison limits its longevity, burn limits its physical damage output, and paralysis can drastically reduce its potency against offense. Make sure to bring Mega Mewtwo X in on Pokemon it forces out, such as Steel-types, or use a teammate's slow momentum move to get it in. Avoid taking unnecessary damage, as Mega Mewtwo X already has a limit on the number of attacks it can deliver in a game due to Life Orb, so it's important that Mega Mewtwo X not waste HP getting a 2HKO where it could have gotten an OHKO. When Mega Mewtwo X forces a switch, it can take the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock to discourage the opponent from switching liberally.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Imposter can be used to scout sets on typical checks to Mega Mewtwo X, such as RegenVest Giratina, Mega Slowbro, and Aegislash. Pokemon that resist Fighting and have the bulk or typing to take on Mega Mewtwo X's other attacks, such as Mega Slowbro and Ho-Oh, can Imposter-proof it. Pokemon that force out Mega Mewtwo X's defensive checks are good partners, such as Mega Diancie and Zekrom. Mega Mewtwo X can also eliminate Steel-types for Mega Diancie and Ground- and Dragon-types for Zekrom. Defoggers such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Mega Audino can remove entry hazards for Mega Mewtwo X to keep its HP as high as possible. Pokemon that check -ate users such as Flash Fire Registeel, Flash Fire Celesteela, and Soundproof Arceus can function as partners to Mega Mewtwo X so it isn't revenge killed. Checks to niche Triage Mega Charizard Y such as Unaware Mega Tyranitar, faster Dazzling users, and Zekrom can function as effective teammates to Mega Mewtwo X. Pokemon such as Registeel, Mega Audino, and Zygarde-C can help Mega Mewtwo X by helping it switch in with their slow pivot moves. If Mega Mewtwo X is not running Stealth Rock, partners with the ability to set up entry hazards such as Zygarde-C, Registeel, and Giratina can be useful. Checks to Mega Gengar such as Yveltal and Mega Audino can afford Mega Mewtwo X more opportunities to wallbreak, as it will no longer have to worry about being revenge killed. Checks to Aegislash, such as Yveltal, Mega Gengar, and Mega Gyarados, should be used if Mega Mewtwo X is not running Bonemerang as Mega Mewtwo X cannot bypass it otherwise. Fur Coat Primal Kyogre can wall Mega Mewtwo X, so Pokemon such as Zekrom and Mega Sceptile can be used deal with it.</p>"

  "Tyranitar-Mega": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Tyranitar is able to effectively run a wide range of sets that offer both offensive and defensive utility due its excellent stat spread and unique typing. In particular, its great offensive Dark typing hits many common defensive Pokemon such as Giratina and Aegislash super effectively. It also gives Mega Tyranitar STAB on useful and powerful moves such as Knock Off and Pursuit. Mega Tyranitar is an especially good user of Shell Smash due to the combination of its very high Attack, resistance to Aerilate Extreme Speed and Triage Oblivion Wing, STAB on Power Trip, and immunity to Prankster-boosted moves. Mega Tyranitar's offensive Poison Heal set is a fearsome bulky sweeper that can wear down its checks over the course of a match through Knock Off and status moves, and its various Choice Band sets are potent wallbreakers that use Pursuit to punch holes in teams by trapping Pokemon like Giratina and Mega Mewtwo Y. However, Mega Tyranitar is held back offensively by a poor Speed stat that leaves it outsped by much of the metagame and having a range of common weaknesses, particularly Fairy, Ground, Steel, and Fighting. This means it is often forced out by common offensive threats like Mega Mewtwo X, Kartana, and Mega Diancie and that many of its sets have limited utility in offense matchups. Despite this, Mega Tyranitar's great mixed bulk, key resistances to Normal, Dark, Ghost, and Flying, and its immunity to Psychic allow it to support its team defensively and serve as an effective answer to Poison Heal Regigigas and many Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo Y sets. The prevalence of Zygarde-C hinders Mega Tyranitar's viability, though, as it can easily check most Mega Tyranitar sets unless it chooses to run otherwise niche Ice-type coverage moves, and its weakness to the extremely common U-turn makes Mega Tyranitar's defensive sets prone to being worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more defensive Poison Heal set can be run that trades the sweeping potential of the offensive Poison Heal set for the ability to more consistently check Pokemon like Regigigas and Mega Rayquaza. Defensive Poison Heal Mega Tyranitar commonly runs a set of Knock Off, Spore, Core Enforcer, and Shore Up with a Careful nature. Occasionally, this set will run Ice-type coverage moves as well. Mega Tyranitar's defensive sets can be customized greatly to suit the specific needs of their team; Mega Tyranitar can remove entry hazards for its teammates with Defog or Rapid Spin or it can set them up itself, Topsy-Turvy lets Mega Tyranitar shut down certain set up sweepers, and Entrainment is an option over Core Enforcer on the Magic Bounce set to mess with Poison Heal Mega Audino and Xerneas. A Mold Breaker set with Knock Off, Pursuit, Spore, and Stealth Rock can make for a potent support Pokemon on offense teams, reliably setting up Stealth Rock, Pursuit trapping Sturdy Shedinja, and spreading sleep. This set is often performed better by Mega Gyarados, however, which is faster and has fewer common weaknesses. The Shell Smash set can run Dazzling as its ability to avoid being revenge killed by Pixilate Mega Diancie or Steelworker Kartana. Mold Breaker is also an option to bypass Fur Coat and Unaware.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon like Xerneas, Mega Audino, and Mega Diancie resist Mega Tyranitar's Dark-type STAB attacks and can hit it super effectively in return. In particular, Poison Heal Xerneas makes a good answer to Mega Tyranitar, as it does not mind having its item removed by Knock Off and cannot be statused by Mega Tyranitar's Poison Heal set. Pixilate Mega Diancie with Extreme Speed can revenge kill Mega Tyranitar's Shell Smash and Poison Heal sweeping sets even when they are boosted. However, they must be wary of Mega Tyranitar's potential Steel-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Fur Coat Users</strong>: As with most physical attackers, Mega Tyranitar usually struggles to break past Fur Coat walls like Giratina and Primal Kyogre due to their immense physical bulk.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Zygarde-C's physical bulk lets it take on Mega Tyranitar even after it has boosted, and it can hit back hard with Thousand Waves. It can be bypassed by Ice-type coverage moves, however.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon takes on most Mega Tyranitar sets with ease. This is due to the combination of its excellent physical bulk, lack of weakness to any of Mega Tyranitar's common moves, and Red Orb to weaken Mega Tyranitar's Knock Off. It hits Mega Tyranitar hard with powerful STAB Ground-type moves in return. Primal Groudon's Desolate Land also cancels Mega Tyranitar's sandstorm.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage Moves</strong>: Mega Tyranitar's large number of common weaknesses make it easy for Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo Y to lure it in and take it down with super effective coverage moves, like Secret Sword, Precipice Blades, and Sunsteel Strike.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-type Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken can easily OHKO Mega Tyranitar with their STAB moves, although they don't often want to switch into Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Prankster</strong>: The Shell Smash set is stopped dead in its tracks by Prankster Haze or Destiny Bond. However, Mega Tyranitar's immunity to targeted Prankster moves like Encore, Will-O-Wisp, and Glare limits their options against it considerably.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash boosts Mega Tyranitar's Attack to astronomical levels and gives it enough Speed to outpace practically the entire unboosted metagame, turning it into a terrifying sweeper. After a Shell Smash, Power Trip becomes extremely powerful, capable of OHKOing almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, including defensive behemoths like Registeel. Sunsteel Strike is used to hit Fairy-types that resist Power Trip, like Mega Audino and Xerneas. It also knocks out Sturdy Shedinja and ignores Unaware, allowing Mega Tyranitar to defeat Unaware Pokemon like Yveltal with some prior damage. Close Combat knocks out Mega Tyranitar's Imposter after a Shell Smash. This is especially valuable with White Herb + Unburden or with an intact Focus Sash, as in these scenarios Mega Tyranitar does not need to risk a Speed tie. Close Combat also hits Mega Gyarados super effectively and 2HKOes Registeel, meaning that Mega Tyranitar is not shut down completely by Registeel's Prankster set. Imprison is an option with Unburden that allows Mega Tyranitar to defeat Imposter Chansey without needing to lower its defenses. To beat Zygarde-C, Mega Tyranitar can opt to run an Ice-type move such as Icicle Spear or Ice Hammer. However, it is rarely worth sacrificing an important coverage move for this purpose.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>White Herb removes the stat drops from Shell Smash, which makes Mega Tyranitar more difficult to revenge kill. It also activates Unburden, allowing Mega Tyranitar to defeat Imposter Pokemon. If Unburden + White Herb is the set of choice and Mega Tyranitar is using Close Combat, it should run 0 Defense EVs and 0 Defense IVs to ensure that it can OHKO its Imposter after a Shell Smash. Alternatively, Focus Sash gives Mega Tyranitar more opportunities to set up, allows it to beat its own Imposter after a Shell Smash if the Focus Sash is still intact, and lets Mega Tyranitar serve as an emergency check to dangerous attackers like Pixilate Mega Diancie and Mega Mewtwo Y; however, the last is reliant on Mega Tyranitar being at full health, making it somewhat unreliable.</p> <p>Simple can be used instead of Unburden to double Mega Tyranitar's stat boosts, making it far more difficult to handle defensively. It notably makes Power Trip far stronger; after a Simple Shell Smash, Power Trip reaches 260 Base Power and can OHKO Zygarde-C and even some Unaware Pokemon like Primal Kyogre. This does put Mega Tyranitar at a far greater risk against Imposter users, however. An Adamant nature is chosen to boost Mega Tyranitar's power and make it more effective at sweeping.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar functions best as a late-game sweeper, once checks like Mega Diancie and Zygarde-C have been weakened or removed. Unburden and Focus Sash are both one-time use, meaning that Mega Tyranitar will not often get a second opportunity to set up and sweep. Thus, it is best to try to scout for users of Prankster or Unaware on the opposing team and wear them down to allow Mega Tyranitar to sweep. Mega Tyranitar can get setup opportunities by forcing out Pokemon like Aegislash and Cresselia that fear its powerful Dark-type moves. It can also set up against Pokemon like Aerilate Mega Rayquaza that it can take hits from and against Choice-locked foes locked into moves that Mega Tyranitar resists or is immune to. Aim to keep entry hazards off the field so Mega Tyranitar can take full advantage of its Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Focus Sash sets appreciate Defog or Rapid Spin support to ensure that the Focus Sash remains intact, making it far easier for Mega Tyranitar to find setup opportunities. Powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Garchomp can support Mega Tyranitar by weakening the foe's defensive core, helping to pave the way for Mega Tyranitar to clean up later in the match. Shedinja is also a good partner, as it baits moves like Moongeist Beam and Photon Geyser that Mega Tyranitar resists or is immune to. While Focus Sash can often allow Simple variants to beat their own Imposter after a Shell Smash, in the event that the Focus Sash is broken and Mega Tyranitar loses against Imposter, it's important to have an emergency check in the back to avoid being swept. A Pokemon with Prankster + Haze like Aegislash can stop Imposter, as can a bulky Unaware user like Zygarde-C or Yveltal. Mega Tyranitar pairs well with other setup sweepers that can wear down Unaware users and Imposter Chansey and potentially bait out Destiny Bond from an opposing Prankster Pokemon, making it easier for Mega Tyranitar to clean up later on.</p>"
      },
      "Poison Heal Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a powerful and reliable STAB move that helps Mega Tyranitar wear down opposing Pokemon by removing items like Leftovers and Eviolite and can also remove Safety Goggles to allow Mega Tyranitar to put its foes to sleep with Spore. Shift Gear boosts Mega Tyranitar's Attack and Speed, making it a threatening sweeper. Mega Tyranitar appreciates a move that can inflict status to help it defeat Imposter Chansey and wear down its checks. Sacred Fire spreads burns somewhat reliably, which wears down Pokemon like Mega Audino and Zygarde-C and cripples Imposter. It also hits Steel-types like Registeel and Kartana super effectively. Will-O-Wisp is an alternative that does not hit Magic Bounce Pokemon or offer coverage against Steel-types but does inflict burns far more reliably. This notably makes Mega Tyranitar much more efficient at beating Imposter users. Spore is an equally valid option, shutting down many of Mega Tyranitar's checks and giving it some free turns to set up boosts and recover HP thanks to Poison Heal. Diamond Storm hits Mega Rayquaza and Yveltal super effectively and is decently strong against Pokemon that resist Dark like Mega Audino and Mega Gyarados. The Defense boosts make Mega Tyranitar harder to revenge kill with Pixilate Mega Diancie's Extreme Speed or Steelworker Kartana's Bullet Punch, and they also allow it to more reliably defeat Poison Heal Regigigas and Imposter Chansey. Additionally, it gives Mega Tyranitar a much more powerful attack to use against neutrally hit foes once their item has been removed by Knock Off. Avalanche is a reasonable alternative that OHKOes Mega Rayquaza and hits Zygarde-C super effectively, and by always moving last it allows Mega Tyranitar to avoid the ability-nullifying effect of Core Enforcer.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Toxic Orb is the most efficient way for Mega Tyranitar to activate Poison Heal, which provides passive recovery that makes Mega Tyranitar extremely difficult to wear down, allows it to sponge status, and enables it to beat its Imposter. The Adamant nature boosts Mega Tyranitar's power, making it easier for it to bust through walls. It also enables Mega Tyranitar to consistently OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y with Knock Off. Jolly may be used instead, but the extra speed is generally unnecessary as Mega Tyranitar outspeeds the vast majority of the metagame after a Shift Gear, and there are very few relevant foes that Mega Tyranitar outspeeds unboosted with Jolly.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar's utility is reduced enormously if it is statused or loses its Toxic Orb before it becomes poisoned. Try to get it in safely to activate the Toxic Orb with slow pivoting moves like Registeel's U-turn or by switching it in on a predicted switch or a move that doesn't hurt it like Giratina's Spectral Thief. With Knock Off and status moves, Mega Tyranitar can wear down opposing teams in the early game to pave the way for a sweep later on. While this set almost always defeats Imposter Chansey if it is healthy enough, at low HP Mega Tyranitar can lose to its Imposter if it gets unlucky with Speed ties and Sacred Fire's burn chance. Aim to keep Mega Tyranitar healthy if the opponent still has an Imposter user to avoid this possibility. Mega Tyranitar should be wary of moves like Core Enforcer and Entrainment that remove its ability, as they will cause it to start taking Toxic damage. Common users of these moves include Zygarde-C and Ferrothorn, and they should ideally be heavily weakened or eliminated before Mega Tyranitar attempts to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow U-turn users like Mega Audino and Aegislash can help get Mega Tyranitar in safely to activate Toxic Orb. Aegislash is a particularly good partner for Mega Tyranitar, as it can take on Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Diancie that often force Mega Tyranitar out. In return, Mega Tyranitar can switch into Dark- and Ghost-type moves aimed at Aegislash. Adaptability Mega Gengar can lure in many of Mega Tyranitar's checks such as Mega Audino and Yveltal and KO or weaken them with Sludge Bomb. Mega Tyranitar baits Core Enforcer, so it can be paired with a Fairy-type Pokemon like Xerneas or Mega Diancie that can switch into Core Enforcer freely and gain momentum.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Mega Tyranitar's main STAB move, able to 2HKO almost anything that doesn't resist it when boosted by Choice Band and Tough Claws. Knock Off's side effect of removing items annoys Mega Tyranitar's switch-ins, and it particularly dissuades Eviolite Imposter Chansey and RegenVest Pokemon from coming in. Pursuit makes Mega Tyranitar into a fearsome trapper, punishing Pokemon like Giratina and Aegislash as they switch out trying to avoid Knock Off. Close Combat is a powerful coverage move that can OHKO bulky Dark-types like Mega Gyarados and opposing Mega Tyranitar and Steel-types like Registeel and Dialga. Close Combat also takes out Mega Tyranitar's Imposter with just a bit of prior damage or if it does not have Eviolite. Sunsteel Strike takes down Fairy-types like Xerneas and Mega Audino and also OHKOes Sturdy Shedinja. Alternatively, Ice Hammer can be used to OHKO Zygarde-C and Mega Rayquaza. Ice Hammer is also Mega Tyranitar's best option against Yveltal. With Adaptability, Diamond Storm can be used to take out Mega Rayquaza, Kyurem-B, and Yveltal and 2HKO miscellaneous Dark-resistant foes like Mega Gyarados and Mega Audino. First Impression and Sucker Punch are both decent options to surprise fast sweepers like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar, especially in combination with Mold Breaker to ignore Dazzling and Queenly Majesty. Both of these moves are extremely poor to be Choice-locked into, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature in combination with Choice Band makes Mega Tyranitar's Attack skyrocket, making it very difficult to wall with proper prediction. Tough Claws boosts Mega Tyranitar's contact moves, increasing its wallbreaking power substantially. It is typically the best ability on this set, as it powers up Mega Tyranitar coverage moves, enabling it to OHKO Registeel with Close Combat and Zygarde-C with Ice Hammer. Mold Breaker allows Mega Tyranitar to Pursuit trap Sturdy Shedinja and more easily break past Fur Coat walls at the expense of being weaker than Tough Claws in all other situations. Adaptability gives a significant boost to the power of Mega Tyranitar's STAB moves, but it does not boost its coverage moves as Tough Claws does. It should always be used alongside Diamond Storm, as this is its only notable advantage when compared to Tough Claws.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar is best used as an early-game wallbreaker, breaking holes in defensive cores with its powerful attacks and Pursuit to pave the way for its teammates to sweep later in the game. Mega Tyranitar can Pursuit trap offensive Pokemon that it can take hits from, like Mega Rayquaza and Mega Gengar, and bulkier Pokemon that are weak to Dark, like Giratina, Aegislash, and Cresselia; however, while it is a very powerful tool, it is also situational and can be risky to become locked into. Be careful with it, as using Pursuit when the opponent doesn't switch can be disastrous for Mega Tyranitar. Furthermore, be mindful that Pursuit can give free setup opportunities to Pokemon like Poison Heal Regigigas. Mega Tyranitar does not often like to switch directly in against Pokemon like Giratina, as they can chip it and escape with U-turn or cripple it with a Will-O-Wisp or Knock Off as it switches in. Try to get Mega Tyranitar in safely against these Pokemon with a slow U-turn user like Mega Audino or RegenVest Primal Kyogre, on a double switch, or on a predicted move like Spectral Thief or Recover that won't hurt it. While Mega Tyranitar does make a solid check to Pokemon like Aerilate Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo Y, a lack of recovery makes this set fairly unreliable at switching into these Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar pairs well with Pokemon like Poison Heal Regigigas, Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken that appreciate its ability to Pursuit trap Pokemon like Aegislash, Giratina, and Cresselia. Choice Band Pheromosa is an especially good partner, as it can get Mega Tyranitar in freely through U-turn against the bulky Ghost-type Pokemon that it baits in. Between Knock Off and Close Combat, Mega Tyranitar is effective at weakening Imposter Chansey, so it partners well with Pokemon like Pixilate Mega Diancie and Mega Mewtwo Y that can struggle against Imposter. Slow Pokemon with U-turn like Registeel and Mega Audino can help Mega Tyranitar switch in freely. While Mega Tyranitar does a good job at dissuading Imposter Chansey from switching in, if it does get in safely, you should have a Pokemon to switch in against its Imposter. Depending on your choice of coverage move, bulky Fairy-types like Mega Audino and Xerneas or a Fur Coat Pokemon like Primal Kyogre can be a good candidate for this role.</p>"
      },
      "Sand Stream": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shore Up is a reliable recovery move that keeps Mega Tyranitar healthy throughout the match and makes it very difficult to wear down under sand. Knock Off is a powerful STAB move that removes pesky items like Imposter Chansey's Eviolite and can remove Safety Goggles and Leftovers to make it easier to wear down foes through sand. Ice Hammer is primarily used to OHKO Mega Rayquaza after sand damage and 2HKO Zygarde-C. Diamond Storm is an alternative that still deals a lot of damage to Mega Rayquaza, although it just misses out on the OHKO. It is notably stronger against Yveltal and Kyurem-B, and the Defense boosts can help Mega Tyranitar take on physical attackers, but it doesn't deal any meaningful damage to Zygarde-C. Mega Tyranitar can defeat its own Imposter using Anchor Shot, which allows it to stall it out of its limited PP while it cannot escape. It also enables Mega Tyranitar to sometimes beat Pixilate Mega Diancie in a one-on-one situation, as Mega Tyranitar can survive a Boomburst or Extreme Speed from full HP under sand and OHKO in return. Alternatively, U-turn allows Mega Tyranitar to get momentum on the bulky Fairy- and Steel-types that would otherwise be able to switch in safely and give a safe switch to a teammate. Mega Tyranitar also makes for a decent setter of Stealth Rock, as it can pressure and wear down common Magic Bounce and Defog Pokemon like Mega Audino and Giratina with Knock Off and sand damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sand Stream summons a sandstorm when Mega Tyranitar enters the battle, which it can take advantage of in numerous ways. The 1.5x boost to Mega Tyranitar's Special Defense allows it to more reliably take on special attackers like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Rayquaza, especially in conjunction with the 66% HP recovery Mega Tyranitar gets from Shore Up. The sandstorm also knocks out Sturdy Shedinja and can provide support to Mega Tyranitar's teammates. A Careful nature bolsters Mega Tyranitar's Special Defense to improve its defensive capabilities. It notably ensures that Mega Tyranitar avoids being OHKOed by Pixilate Mega Diancie's Boomburst. If you opt to run U-turn, Mega Tyranitar should run a Sassy nature with minimized Speed EVs and IVs to allow it to pivot out after Pokemon like Giratina and Zygarde-C and give its teammates a safe switch. Leftovers helps to keep Mega Tyranitar healthy. Smooth Rock is a strong alternative on teams that aim to take full advantage of the sandstorm, while Safety Goggles protects Mega Tyranitar from Spore, which can be especially helpful against some variants of Triage Mega Rayquaza.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>On dedicated sand teams, take care to keep Mega Tyranitar healthy so it can continue to set up sand throughout the match. Many defensive Pokemon run U-turn, which will quickly wear Mega Tyranitar down. Against teams with Shedinja, aim to keep sand up as much as possible so as to never give Shedinja an opportunity to safely switch in and gain momentum. Many of the Pokemon that Mega Tyranitar checks, like Mega Gengar and Mega Rayquaza, can sometimes carry Fighting- or Ground-type coverage moves, so it is best to try to scout for those to avoid being caught off guard. Take advantage of the switches that Mega Tyranitar forces to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set should be paired with Pokemon that can take advantage of the sand that it sets up. Other Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Mega Aerodactyl appreciate the Special Defense boost, and Pokemon with Shore Up benefit greatly from the extra recovery. This set also pairs nicely with Pokemon like Aerilate Mega Rayquaza that can struggle to beat Sturdy Shedinja. Finally, Sand Rush can be used on slow but powerful wallbreakers like Mega Garchomp to turn them into a devastating sweeper while the sand is active. Aegislash pairs well with Mega Tyranitar defensively, taking on Fairy-, Fighting-, and Steel-type attackers that Mega Tyranitar may struggle with. Pokemon with Spore appreciate Mega Tyranitar's support in removing foes' Safety Goggles with Knock Off.</p>"
      },
      "Magic Bounce": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shore Up is used to keep Mega Tyranitar's health up and allow it perform its role throughout the match. Knock Off is a strong, reliable STAB move that weakens foes by taking away their items. While it is not as effective at trapping as the Choice Band set, Magic Bounce Mega Tyranitar makes good use of Pursuit to weaken Pokemon like Aegislash, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Cresselia that it forces out. Pursuit is especially effective against Normalize Mega Gengar, as it will typically be unable to meaningfully damage Mega Tyranitar after its Entrainment is bounced back, and it can be OHKOed by Pursuit as it switches out. Core Enforcer makes Mega Tyranitar a reliable answer to various Poison Heal Pokemon, like Regigigas, Giratina, and other Mega Tyranitar, as it suppresses their ability and makes them take poison damage. Ice Hammer can be used to take out Mega Rayquaza and Zygarde-C, and Anchor Shot is an option to allow Mega Tyranitar to trap and stall out Imposter Chansey and dissuade Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Mega Audino from switching in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magic Bounce provides Mega Tyranitar a lot of utility. Most notably, it reflects Normalize Mega Gengar's Entrainment and Poison Heal Regigigas's Spore, allowing Mega Tyranitar to serve as a reliable counter to both of those sets. Additionally, it protects Mega Tyranitar from status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Glare and bounces back entry hazards, providing valuable support for Mega Tyranitar's teammates. Leftovers keeps Mega Tyranitar's HP high throughout the match. A Sassy nature maximizes Mega Tyranitar's special bulk, which helps it out against Mega Rayquaza and Mega Mewtwo Y. Sassy is chosen over Careful in combination with minimized Speed IVs and EVs to ensure that it can remove the foe's ability with Core Enforcer and prevent Giratina and Zygarde-C from getting momentum via a slower U-turn. Having minimal speed also makes Mega Tyranitar's Pursuit stronger against these foes if they use U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Tyranitar can safely switch into most Poison Heal Regigigas and Normalize Mega Gengar sets and beat them one-on-one, but be cautious against non-Normalize Mega Gengar sets, which commonly carry Secret Sword. You can use Pursuit to wear down Pokemon like Aegislash that Mega Tyranitar threatens out, Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza that Mega Tyranitar walls, and Choice item users like Mega Mewtwo X locked into a move that is ineffective against Mega Tyranitar. Pursuit is also quite strong in combination with Core Enforcer, as Poison Heal users will often be forced to switch after their ability is removed. Mega Tyranitar can usually safely switch in against most Giratina sets and force them out, making it a fairly risk-free way to scout out their moveset and deal some good chip damage with Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is a good partner for Sturdy Shedinja, as it helps keep entry hazards off the field and can use Pursuit to weaken or KO the Ghost-type Pokemon that block Shedinja's Endeavor. Other Pokemon that appreciate Mega Tyranitar's ability to reflect entry hazards include Kyurem-B and Mega Rayquaza. Mega Diancie makes for a good partner with Mega Tyranitar, as Mega Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Aegislash, Normalize Mega Gengar, and some variants of Dazzling Mega Mewtwo Y, all of which are solid Mega Diancie checks. Poison Heal Xerneas can take advantage of an Imposter Chansey that is Transformed into Mega Tyranitar to freely set up Quiver Dances.</p>"

  "Shedinja": {
    "overview": "<p>Shedinja's role in Balanced Hackmons is a unique one. Shedinja is hardcoded to always have its raw HP stat be 1. Because of this, Sturdy Shedinja can only be KOed by very few things, as it always has full HP, which allows Shedinja to survive almost any attack. Due to its low Speed stat in conjunction with the ability to survive almost any attack, Shedinja is able to provide momentum to the team against most Pokemon. This allows Shedinja's teammates to come onto the field for free. Shedinja's 1 HP also allows it to bring any non-Ghost-type Pokemon down to 1 HP with Endeavor, which is a fantastic asset for Shedinja, as it forces a lot of switches due to this. Most teams lack a reliable way to deal with a good team built around Shedinja as well, primarily relying on entry hazards or Mold Breaker with Pursuit to get around it. These ways to check Shedinja have multiple forms of counterplay on most teams built around it, allowing Shedinja to devastate opposing teams.</p> <p>Despite these benefits of using Shedinja, it suffers from very exploitable weaknesses. Shedinja's 1 HP leaves it KOed by any form of passive damage such as hazards, status, and weather. Photon Geyser, Sunsteel Strike, and Moongeist Beam ignore abilities, meaning they bypass Sturdy and are able to KO Shedinja. These moves are common on many offensive Pokemon, including Mega Mewtwo X, Kartana, and Mega Gengar. Mold Breaker users can bypass Sturdy and KO Shedinja with any attack, and if the Mold Breaker Pokemon has Pursuit, it can ensure a KO on Shedinja due to it being KOed if it attempts to switch out. Due to these weaknesses, Shedinja requires a lot of support to use successfully, such as Magic Bounce support and hazard removal. In addition to the aforementioned team support, Shedinja requires a lot of scouting to avoid being surprised by the above checks and getting KOed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Spectral Thief can be run over Foresight to hit Ghost-types, steal boosts, and function as a move that deals overall good chip damage. However, Shedinja is weak, so Foresight is preferred, as it allows Shedinja to 2HKO Ghost-types with Endeavor into Extreme Speed. Shedinja also needs its other three moveslots, so Spectral Thief is generally difficult to fit onto the set. Shedinja can opt to run Pain Split over Endeavor, which allows it to halve the HP of every Pokemon as well as hitting Ghost-types without the use of Foresight. Pain Split also avoids contact and has more PP, so it can be used more freely. However, this is a lot slower for KOing Pokemon, and Shedinja is often running Protective Pads anyway, so Endeavor is the preferred move. Shedinja can run Safety Goggles to be immune to weather damage and Spore, but it appreciates Protective Pads more. Shedinja can run Lum Berry to have a safeguard against status, but this only works once and you can run Misty Surge on your teammates for a more reliable status immunity. Shedinja should use Recycle to recover its Lum Berry, but Shedinja doesn't enjoy losing any of its four moves for Recycle. Make sure to use Ice Shard while holding Lum Berry, as it avoids making contact, so Shedinja does not make contact with Rocky Helmet, Baneful Bunker, and Spiky Shield users. In addition, run Baton Pass over U-turn if Shedinja holds a Lum Berry for another way to prevent contact.</p> <p>Shedinja can use a Magic Guard set to be immune to weather and status, but it is forced to use Focus Sash and cannot function as effectively due to having to continually use Recycle or surviving only two hits if it does not. Shedinja can run a Pixilate set to hit Ghost-types with Endeavor without prediction, but most Pokemon do not hesitate to use U-turn against Shedinja so its Focus Sash will be consumed very quickly, and it cannot do anything aside from claim one surprise KO in specific matchups. Shedinja can function as a quite effective Stealth Rock setter due to it forcing out every Magic Bounce user aside from Giratina, but as previously mentioned, it already has four-moveslot syndrome. Shedinja can run Baneful Bunker over Foresight to scout for Sunsteel Strike, Moongeist Beam, and Photon Geyser, as well as poisoning Pokemon that use U-turn. However, it's difficult to drop any of the four other moves in the set to make room for Baneful Bunker. Shedinja can run Safeguard to make itself and its teammates immune to status for a short duration, but it generally isn't worth a moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Moves That Ignore Abilities</strong>: Sunsteel Strike, Moongeist Beam, and Photon Geyser all KO Shedinja and can surprise it from any offensive Pokemon. For this reason, it's crucial to scout for these moves and potentially stall them out if necessary using Shedinja's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Mold Breaker attacks bypass Sturdy, so they OHKO Shedinja. Fortunately, Mold Breaker announces itself, so unless the Mold Breaker user has Pursuit, Shedinja can simply switch out. However, if Mold Breaker Pokemon have Pursuit, Shedinja has no viable way to beat them and inevitably will get KOed.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: If Shedinja is burned or poisoned, it will get KOed unless Shedinja holds a Lum Berry. It is recommended to scout for status. However, Shedinja can avoid being statused with Misty Surge support.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types can switch in on an Endeavor if necessary, and if Shedinja lacks Foresight, they can cause Shedinja trouble. Giratina in particular deserves a special mention, as even if Shedinja has Spectral Thief, Giratina is bulky enough to not get 2HKOed by it.</p> <p><strong>Sand and Hail</strong>: Sand and hail KO non-Safety Goggles Shedinja. There is no way for Shedinja to beat these two weathers other than Safety Goggles, so it is recommended that you KO their setter as early as possible using other teammates. Fortunately, these two weathers are relatively uncommon in the metagame.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Endeavor allows Shedinja to bring most Pokemon to 1 HP, automatically putting the opposing Pokemon in range of Shedinja's other offensive moves. Extreme Speed is used to finish the job, KOing every Pokemon after it has been hit by Endeavor, save for Poison Heal Zygarde-C. It also has a higher priority than Prankster, ensuring that Shedinja is able to KO Prankster Pokemon such as Registeel and Zygarde-C. Ice Shard can be used over Extreme Speed to KO Poison Heal Zygarde-C after Endeavor, but it fails to KO other defensive Pokemon such as Leftovers Registeel and Poison Heal Mega Audino. Ice Shard also has 48 PP, which can be useful in PP stalling scenarios. U-turn is used to allow Shedinja to gain momentum as well as chip the opposing Pokemon. It also has the use of avoiding Mold Breaker Pursuit if the Mold Breaker user switches in as Shedinja uses U-turn. Foresight allows Endeavor and Extreme Speed to hit non-Magic Bounce Ghost-types, making Shedinja more effective and enabling it to use Endeavor more freely. Pursuit is used to damage Pokemon that attempt to switch out on Shedinja. If the opponent attempts to switch their Pokemon out after an Endeavor, Pursuit is able to pick up a KO. In addition, Pursuit damages Imposter users fairly heavily if they ever decide to switch in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Sturdy grants Shedinja the ability to survive almost any attack and force a multitude of switches. Shedinja has its Speed minimized so it can avoid having its ability suppressed by as many Core Enforcer users as possible. In addition to this, minimum Speed investment allows Shedinja to have a slower U-turn, bringing in the Pokemon of choice safely most of the time. Protective Pads allows Shedinja to avoid Rocky Helmet and Spiky Shield damage and prevents it from being poisoned by Baneful Bunker. 0 IVs in Defense and Special Defense allow it to make Imposter users as frail as possible, letting Shedinja deal more damage with Pursuit as well as letting teammates damage the Imposter user more heavily, wearing it down more quickly. A Brave nature allows Shedinja to be as strong as possible while being the slowest it can be.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Endeavor should be used with caution, as it only has 8 PP and using it too liberally can drastically lower how much of a threat Shedinja is to the opposing team. Scout for Sunsteel Strike, Moongeist Beam, and Photon Geyser when facing offensive Pokemon before sending Shedinja in on them. Take care to scout for status-inducing moves such as Poison Fang and Will-O-Wisp, as they KO Shedinja the turn it gets statused. Be wary of sand and hail; make sure to scout for Pokemon with Sand Stream and Snow Warning before using anything other than U-turn on Shedinja. Make sure entry hazards are off the field at all times. U-turn has 32 PP, so it can be used liberally while also granting momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shedinja necessitates Magic Bounce support due to it warding off status and entry hazards. Pokemon such as Mega Audino, Giratina, and Zygarde-C can all provide this support. Shedinja also requires hazard removal support, as 1 HP means it will automatically be KOed by any damaging hazard. Almost any defensive Pokemon can run Defog to help Shedinja. Shedinja appreciates Imposter Pokemon such as Chansey to scout moves that can harm Shedinja, such as Sunsteel Strike and Will-O-Wisp. Misty Surge Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Giratina can prevent Shedinja from being statused under Misty Terrain. Strong Pursuit users that can KO Imposter Pokemon, hit Ghost-types, and hit Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar hard are all amazing options for Shedinja's teammates. Dark-types with Pursuit are useful in particular, as they resist or are immune to Photon Geyser and Moongeist Beam. Mega Gyarados resists Sunsteel Strike as well, making it an excellent partner to Shedinja. Pokemon that can beat Giratina such as Xerneas, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Gengar all enjoy the switches Shedinja forces, as when Shedinja uses U-turn, it can bring in one of these Pokemon for free. Wallbreakers such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Diancie all appreciate Shedinja's ability to force switches, as they are all able to capitalize on the vast majority of Ghost-types in the metagame. Defensive Pokemon such as Registeel, Giratina, and Zygarde-C are useful due to Shedinja breaking opposing walls for them, limiting the number of opposing defensive Pokemon that may be able to PP stall them. Toxic Spikes are useful, as it allows Shedinja to KO many Pokemon with just Endeavor, as poison finishes the job.</p>"

  "Kyogre-Primal": {
    "overview": "<p>Primal Kyogre's excellent 100 / 160 special bulk along with its high base 180 Special Attack and base 150 Attack makes it a versatile option on many Balanced Hackmons teams, capable of fulfilling non-passive defensive roles thanks to resistances to common types such as Fire, Steel, Water, and Ice while having only two weaknesses to Grass and Electric or serving as a strong special attacker. These traits allow it to answer threats such as Mega Gengar, Dialga, and Poison Heal Primal Kyogre and Xerneas while capable of blanket checking a large portion of the special attackers of the metagame. It also can run a variety of offensive sets such as Poison Heal and Choice Specs Primordial Sea that are difficult to switch into and can be very unpredictable and threatening. However, Primal Kyogre's Speed is low for an offensive Pokemon and leaves it vulnerable to faster attackers, although its bulk somewhat makes up for this. Also, Water is a poor offensive typing, hitting very few Pokemon super effectively while being resisted by common types such as Dragon and Water, though Kyogre's massive Special Attack mitigates this a bit. In addition, despite its good special bulk, its physical bulk is quite lackluster and leaves it weak to powerful physical attackers like Kartana and Mega Mewtwo X.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>For the Unaware set, Baton Pass can be run over U-turn for the extra PP in slower matchups and its ability to ignore contact move-punishing moves and Rocky Helmet, but it cannot break Focus Sashes and also passes stat drops. In addition, Beak Blast is an option to deter contact moves such as U-turn, but Primal Kyogre loses out on a lot of the utility other moves bring. Other defensive abilities such as Comatose and Fur Coat can also be run; Comatose can prevent some status moves and provide a counter to Poison Heal Primal Kyogre and Xerneas that, unlike Magic Bounce variants, will not get poisoned from Toxic Spikes and Poison Fang, while Fur Coat improves Primal Kyogre's physical bulk and allows it to check some physical attackers better, like Kyurem-B. However, those sets are generally less viable or better run on another defensive Pokemon. A Sheer Force set using Steam Eruption, Ice Beam, Bolt Strike, and Shell Smash is a fast sweeper that can surprise many teams due to its immediate increase in power and can OHKO opposing Primal Kyogre and Giratina with a boosted Bolt Strike or Ice Beam. A defensive Poison Heal set is possible with Scald, Stealth Rock, Spiky Shield, and Ice Beam or Knock Off, providing a hazard setter with longevity while not requiring much team support.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Primal Kyogre and Mega Gyarados both resist Water, have great special bulk, and don't take much from coverage moves. Opposing Primal Kyogre can use Core Enforcer and Spectral Thief to deal damage back while Mega Gyarados threatens with Knock Off. All Mega Gyarados sets and non-RegenVest Kyogre get 2HKOed by maximum power Water Spout from the wallbreaker set, however.</p> <p><strong>Other Bulky Water Answers</strong>: Bulky Pokemon that resist Water, such as Giratina and Ferrothorn, can take Primal Kyogre's Water moves with ease and proceed to retaliate. They can also tank the coverage moves if needed. The wallbreaker set can 2HKO them with Water Spout, however.</p> <p><strong>Red Orb Groudon</strong>: Red Orb Groudon sets Desolate Land, which renders Primal Kyogre's Water-type STAB moves useless and takes the coverage moves well. In return, it can 2HKO Primal Kyogre with V-create or set up. It fears Earth Power from the wallbreaker set, however, and loses if the weather has been reset if Primal Kyogre switches in or its ability has been nullified by Core Enforcer or other ability-removing moves. The rare Fur Coat Primal Kyogre can also tank the hits and defeat Primal Groudon.</p> <p><strong>Imposter Users</strong>: Imposter Chansey is one of the few switch-ins to the wallbreaker and threatens Primal Kyogre out. It can also recover in front of defensive sets and take advantage of Regenerator for free. It can also annoy the RegenVest set with Core Enforcer, removing the only source of recovering health. However, it loses to the Poison Heal set and cannot switch in safely to the Sheer Force set.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X, Kartana, and Regigigas can target Primal Kyogre's weaker physical bulk and defeat it. Mega Mewtwo Y can use Psystrike to do the same. The physical attackers must be wary of burns, although Regigigas doesn't care if Toxic Orb has been activated.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Super powerful attackers such as Regigigas can use brute force to break past even defensive Primal Kyogre.</p> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-types</strong>: Grass- and Electric-types such as Mega Sceptile and Zekrom can hit Primal Kyogre for super effective damage. Grass-types have a bonus of resisting Water. These Pokemon are rare in the metagame, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "RegenVest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn allows Primal Kyogre to pivot which allows it to gain momentum and health through Regenerator, and unlike Volt Switch and Parting Shot, it cannot be blocked. Revelation Dance is a decently powerful STAB move that hits Normalize Mega Gengar, as it ignores Normalize when Primal Kyogre gets hit with Entrainment, and can chip opposing Pokemon such as Registeel and Mega Audino. If Mega Gengar is not a problem, Scald can be run to spread burns, and it is also useful to wear opposing Pokemon down and deter Sturdy Shedinja. However, Primal Kyogre becomes more difficult to Imposter-proof because of the threat of burns, most likely requiring a Pokemon with an ability like Comatose or Poison Heal, limiting the team options. Spectral Thief lets Primal Kyogre steal stat boosts from the opposing Pokemon, letting it reliably check threats like Poison Heal Primal Kyogre and Xerneas while preventing Kyogre from being setup fodder. Core Enforcer can nullify useful abilities like Poison Heal and Regenerator and hits Dragon-types like Giratina and Mega Garchomp hard. Nuzzle is an option to be able to slow down fast sweepers and help with non-Choice Scarf Imposter Speed ties. However, Imposter users will be able to paralyze your Pokemon as well, limiting the possible Imposter-proofs for Primal Kyogre to status-immune Pokemon such as Comatose Giratina. Ice Beam provides decent coverage with Revelation Dance or Scald and OHKOes Mega Garchomp, which can usually force Primal Kyogre out. If the team lacks an entry hazard remover, Rapid Spin can be run. However, this is a poor move on Primal Kyogre, as it fails to pressure common spinblockers like Giratina. Rapid Spin should be run along with Scald to effectively annoy Giratina with Scald burns and Core Enforcer nullifying Poison Heal, while also forcing out Shedinja, another spinblocker.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Sassy nature along with 0 Speed IVs is run to maximize Primal Kyogre's special bulk while letting it Speed tie with opposing mininum investment base 90 Speed Pokemon to slow pivot, letting it bring in frail teammates in safely. As an alternative, 116 Speed EVs and a Sassy nature let Primal Kyogre outspeed everything up to and including base 150 Speed Pokemon after stealing a Shell Smash boost, allowing it to KO the opposing Pokemon before taking another hit. This comes at a cost of almost always outspeeding opposing defensive pivots, however. An Assault Vest further amplifies Primal Kyogre's special bulk, letting it take on powerful special attackers like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar better. Regenerator allows Primal Kyogre to regain a third of its health every time it switches out, and is the only way for this set to recover health. This differentiates from other healing methods, as it doesn't force Primal Kyogre to lose momentum by using a recovering move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Primal Kyogre in against special attackers it can handle, such as Mega Gengar, opposing Primal Kyogre, and Xerneas. It is important to scout the moveset of the Pokemon you are planning to switch Primal Kyogre into, as it may carry a strong coverage move, such as Bolt Strike on Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y. Be careful with strong physical attackers, as Primal Kyogre's modest physical bulk isn't enough to take strong hits. Since this set does not carry Safety Goggles, beware of Spore, as it cripples Primal Kyogre. Since Primal Kyogre needs its Assault Vest to check the special attackers it is supposed to check, avoid Knock Off, as it will reduce Primal Kyogre's special bulk. If Primal Kyogre is low on HP, switch it in safely and switch out to instantly to regain a third of its health. Because Primal Kyogre is reliant on Regenerator as its only form of recovery, avoid Core Enforcers from slower Pokemon like Registeel and Mega Audino. U-turn is excellent for regaining health with momentum, chipping opposing Pokemon and bringing in teammates safely, and is very easy to spam, especially if the opposing Pokemon is unable to pressure Primal Kyogre. Revelation Dance and Scald are also easy to spam thanks to STAB, being able to chip opposing walls and, in Scald's case, spread burns. If the opposing Pokemon is a setup sweeper, Spectral Thief will steal the stat boosts and neuter their power. While this set is vulnerable to Imposter users, using Scald or Nuzzle can burn or paralyze them, reducing their effectiveness.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types such as Registeel and Celesteela are appreciated in taking on -ate Pokemon like Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B which can target Primal Kyogre's poor physical bulk. They also can take on strong physical attackers like Kartana that threaten Primal Kyogre. Imposter Chansey is useful for scouting oposing movesets, which help determine if Primal Kyogre can switch in against opposing attackers. Entry hazard removers like Magic Bounce Giratina and Mega Audino are appreciated, as Primal Kyogre hates taking chip damage, even with Regenerator. A Knock Off absorber like Griseous Orb Giratina or a Poison Heal user with its Toxic Orb already activated prevents Primal Kyogre from losing its very important Assault Vest. Dragon-types like Giratina and Zygarde-C can tank the Grass- and Electric- type moves targeted at Primal Kyogre and also help with answering Red Orb Groudon. Physical walls like Mega Slowbro and Prankster Giratina check dangerous physical wallbreakers, which force Primal Kyogre out. It is necessary to have a Pokemon that can take care of an opposing Imposter user that transformed into Primal Kyogre, as this set often gives free recovery for the opponent's Imposter. Examples include Red Orb Groudon, Ferrothorn, and Comatose Giratina. In addition, Toxic Spikes, offensive Poison Heal users like Regigigas and Xerneas, and Mold Breaker attackers such as Mega Gengar that can pressure opposing Imposter users are appreciated. Primal Kyogre's longevity and bulk allow it to be paired with powerful special attackers that it can Imposter-proof, such as Kyurem-W.</p>"
      },
      "Poison Heal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance is a reliable setup move to boost Primal Kyogre's offensive presence and special bulk. It also boosts Kyogre's Speed, potentially allowing a sweep and letting it outspeed dangerous offensive threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y at +1. Water Spout is a powerful STAB move that is very threatening to anything that doesn't resist it, while the passive Poison Heal recovery helps keep its power high. However, it only has 8 PP. Scald is a reliable alternative STAB move with good PP and decent power along with a chance to burn the opposing Pokemon, letting Primal Kyogre threaten physical attackers more. However, it is much weaker compared to Water Spout and is less threatening. Also, Scald burns can conflict with sleep Primal Kyogre may want to inflict instead. Moonblast is a good coverage move that hits Dragon-types as well as Mega Gyarados and Mega Mewtwo X hard. It does make Ferrothorn and Red Orb Groudon problems, however. Ice Beam is an alternative coverage move that hits Dragon- and Grass-types and hits Zygarde-C harder than Moonblast. It can also provide potential hax through fishing for freezes, but it does mean Primal Kyogre will struggle with opposing Primal Kyogre and Mega Gyarados. Lovely Kiss puts foes to sleep and bypasses Safety Goggles, opening up free turns that allow Primal Kyogre to regain health with Poison Heal during the sleep turns. It also cripples defensive Pokemon to break past them easier and allows Primal Kyogre to defeat Imposter. Poison Heal also prevents backfiring from Magic Bounce, allowing Primal Kyogre to safely run Lovely Kiss without fear it will be put to sleep if the move is bounced back. Spore is a more reliable way to put foes asleep, though Primal Kyogre prefers Knock Off support to remove Safety Goggles that block it. Tail Glow gives Primal Kyogre an immediate power boost, letting it defeat defensive answers like Poison Heal Giratina. Freeze-Dry is an alternative coverage move that provides perfect neutral coverage with Water, but it is quite weak and worsens the Imposter matchup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature provides extra power; the extra Speed provided by Timid isn't very useful, since Primal Kyogre outspeeds everything up to and including Timid Mega Mewtwo Y at +1 already. On the other hand, the extra power can allow Kyogre to defeat some bulky walls such as RegenVest Registeel with Water Spout at +1 and is useful for chipping down defensive answers when unboosted. A Toxic Orb reliably activates Poison Heal, which provides Primal Kyogre with an immunity to status and gives a passive recovery of 12.5% of the maximum health each turn, making Kyogre durable and difficult to wear down. The immunity to other status also lets it absorb sleep moves and defeat Imposter users by putting them to sleep. Poison Heal also makes Primal Kyogre a decent Knock Off absorber after Toxic Orb activation.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pivot Primal Kyogre in safely to activate the Toxic Orb, as failing to activate Poison Heal greatly diminishes Primal Kyogre's ability by removing its passive healing and status immunity. Once Poison Heal has been triggered, Primal Kyogre can set up in front of defensive Pokemon that cannot threaten it. Beware of Spectral Thief, as it can steal Primal Kyogre's boosts, which not only reduces Primal Kyogre's power but also makes the opponent bulkier. Avoid Core Enforcer, Entrainment, and Worry Seed, because they will nullify Poison Heal and result in Primal Kyogre taking massive poison damage. Unboosted Water Spout can be used to chip opposing Pokemon and scout for the opponent's Primal Kyogre answer. Use Tail Glow against bulky teams to break through them faster, which also leaves Primal Kyogre less susceptible to Spectral Thief, as it will not give the opponent Special Defense boosts. If Primal Kyogre is low on health, bring it in via a slow pivot to gain free Poison Heal health. After a few turns of Poison Heal recovery, Primal Kyogre will often be healthy enough to set up again. If needed, Primal Kyogre can defensively check Refrigerate users. Thanks to Poison Heal negating chip damage and status, Primal Kyogre can sponge U-turn and status as well as Knock Off once Toxic Orb has been activated.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A slow pivot like Registeel or Mega Audino can bring Primal Kyogre in safely to activate Toxic Orb. Attackers such as Mega Sceptile and Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y that can pressure Water-type switch-ins like Primal Kyogre and Giratina are appreciated, as the aforementioned Pokemon can eat a hit and use Core Enforcer, forcing Primal Kyogre out. An entry hazard setter is nice to chip switch-ins and help Primal Kyogre pressure them, as they are generally susceptible to entry hazards, especially Spikes. Since Primal Kyogre often attracts Core Enforcer to negate Poison Heal, a Fairy-type can come in safely to gain momentum. Examples include Mega Audino, Mega Diancie, and Xerneas.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Revelation Dance is a decently strong STAB move that can hit Normalize Mega Gengar even after Primal Kyogre has been hit with Entrainment, though Primal Kyogre must be careful, as it can still lose to Quiver Dance variants if they have used Entrainment on the switch. Scald is an alternative STAB move that spreads burns if Normalize Mega Gengar is not a problem. Shore Up is mandatory to keep Primal Kyogre healthy throughout the match. Spectral Thief lets Primal Kyogre steal stat boosts, allowing it to check setup attackers. It also deals respectable damage against super effective targets like Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y. U-turn can allow slow pivots to bring in teammates safely. It is chosen over other pivoting moves because it is unblockable, unlike Volt Switch and Parting Shot, and can break Focus Sash, unlike Baton Pass. Core Enforcer and Entrainment can remove abilities such as Poison Heal from the opposing Pokemon, effectively forcing them out. Note that Core Enforcer also pressures Dragon-types such as Giratina, while Entrainment has more PP and can hit Fairy-types. Nuzzle slows down fast sweepers and helps with Speed ties with non-Choice Scarf Imposter users. Anchor Shot can trap Imposter users lured in by Primal Kyogre and PP stall them. Defog is an option to clear entry hazards and pairs well with Magic Bounce. Topsy-Turvy can be run over Spectral Thief to hit Normal-types like Arceus.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Sassy nature lets Primal Kyogre take strong special attackers like Mega Mewtwo Y better as well and makes the Primal Kyogre and Xerneas matchup easier. A Relaxed nature, on the other hand, slightly patches Primal Kyogre's lower Defense stat and reduces chip damage from U-turn and Spectral Thief. A Sassy nature is usually the better choice, however, as Primal Kyogre is more suited as a specially defensive Pokemon. Safety Goggles prevents Spore, as some setup attackers carry Spore, which cripples Primal Kyogre and temporarily shuts it down. Leftovers grants passive recovery, which is useful for negating chip damage and increasing Primal Kyogre's longevity. Unaware lets Primal Kyogre ignore opposing stat boosts, which allows it to beat certain setup sweepers. Magic Bounce is an alternative that prevents sleep from Lovely Kiss and blocks Entrainment, letting Primal Kyogre counter Xerneas and Mega Gengar more effectively without getting put to sleep. This also allows Primal Kyogre to run a different item over Safety Goggles. Ghostium Z lets Kyogre safely defeat Normalize Gengar while OHKOing Mega Mewtwo Y as well.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Primal Kyogre to answer dangerous setup attackers like Mega Gengar and Poison Heal Primal Kyogre and Xerneas. With Unaware, it can also check certain Shell Smash users like Mega Gengar. However, be careful around Mold Breaker, Moongeist Beam, and Photon Geyser, as they ignore Unaware and can heavily damage Primal Kyogre. Also watch out for ability-nullifying moves like Core Enforcer and Entrainment, since they also remove Unaware and make Primal Kyogre much more susceptible to setup. Use Spectral Thief against boosted targets, as it makes them easier to handle for teammates. Stealing defensive boosts can also help Primal Kyogre take more hits, with notable examples being Moongeist Beam and Photon Geyser, as those attacks ignore Unaware but not stat boosts. Revelation Dance and Scald are great for chipping opposing Pokemon and U-turn is a great option against foes that fail to pressure Primal Kyogre. Core Enforcer is effective at annoying the opponent, especially against Pokemon that heavily depend on their ability, such as Poison Heal and Regenerator users. Keep Primal Kyogre's health high with Shore Up, especially against known setup attackers like Mega Gengar, as Primal Kyogre can get 2HKOed if not healthy enough.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Steel-types like Registeel and Aegislash, especially with Flash Fire, can take on -ate Pokemon while being able to answer some threatening physical attackers like Kartana and Regigigas. Checks to powerful physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X are appreciated, as Primal Kyogre cannot take them on well. Examples include Mega Slowbro, Zygarde-C, and Prankster Giratina. Bulky walls such as Zygarde-C that struggle against strong setup attackers, especially specially attacking ones, appreciate Primal Kyogre blanket checking them, while they can help against wallbreakers that can use brute force to break through Primal Kyogre. Entry hazard removers are necessary, as Primal Kyogre is vulnerable to chip damage, which forces it to waste momentum recovering, as it needs to have high health to check the appropriate attackers. Defensive Pokemon that can run Defog, Rapid Spin, and Magic Bounce like Registeel, Yveltal, and Mega Audino, respectively, are also good options. Despite Unaware, Primal Kyogre can get overwhelmed by certain setup sweepers like Mega Sceptile and Belly Drum Necrozma-DM. Thus, a secondary setup answer such as Prankster Registeel or Giratina can help.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boosted by rain, STAB, and Choice Specs, Water Spout is ridiculously powerful and can OHKO common defensive Pokemon like Registeel and Mega Audino. Steam Eruption is a good secondary STAB move that is useful for spreading burns and when Primal Kyogre is low on health. The potential threat of a burn also deters Sturdy Shedinja as well as physical revenge killers like Mega Diancie. Ice Beam provides good coverage and hits Pokemon such as Giratina and Zygarde-C hard without consuming Water Spout PP. It also does a good chunk to Red Orb Groudon and OHKOes Zygarde-C, which no other move can, especially on Tinted Lens variants. Volt Switch lets Primal Kyogre pivot out of checks to deal chip damage and gain momentum. U-turn is an option if the Imposter-proof teammate isn't Primal Groudon, letting Primal Kyogre pivot out while not getting blocked by opposing Primal Groudon. Water Shuriken is a decent priority move that can revenge kill some Pokemon or clean up some faster threats. However, the damage output is quite lacking even with rain and Choice Specs, and Primal Kyogre usually appreciates the coverage or pivoting more. Also, running Water Shuriken results in three Water moves and a lot of type redundancy. Earth Power specifically hits Red Orb Groudon, which is immune to the Water moves thanks to Desolate Land, guaranteeing an OHKO with some prior chip damage, but it doesn't hit any other relevant targets. Moonblast is an alternative move to hit Dragon-types while letting a teammate Red Orb Groudon Imposter-proof Primal Kyogre, since it will resist or be immune to all Primal Kyogre's moves. Knock Off can be run to remove Assault Vests from opposing Primal Kyogre and Giratina, Eviolite from Chansey, and even Protective Pads from Shedinja, allowing Primal Kyogre to break past them more easily or making them easier to be dealt with by teammates. However, it is usually better on a teammate instead, as a Choice-locked and unboosted Knock Off can be taken advantage of easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature provides Primal Kyogre with maximum power, letting it hit important benchmarks such as OHKOing Registeel and 2HKOing Giratina. A Timid nature can be run to outspeed neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Impish or Bold Giratina and 2HKO it, but such Pokemon usually don't run max Speed. Choice Specs boosts Primal Kyogre's Special Attack to sky-high levels. Primordial Sea boosts Primal Kyogre's Water-type moves by 50%, and combined with Choice Specs it leaves very few Pokemon capable of taking Water Spout, limited to the most bulky Pokemon that resist or are immune to Water such as RegenVest Primal Kyogre and Giratina. If rain is set by a teammate, Tinted Lens can be run to fully remove all switch-ins, OHKOing non-Assault Vest Giratina. Tinted Lens can also be run outside of rain support to pressure Pokemon that resist harder, but Primal Kyogre misses out on many key OHKOs on other passive Pokemon such as Registeel and Mega Audino. Swift Swim can also be run to outspeed up to and including Mega Mewtwo Y and lets Primal Kyogre take on otherwise faster foes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Primal Kyogre in safely through a slow pivot, as it loses a lot of its wallbreaking power if it takes chip damage that reduces Water Spout's base power. In general, Water Spout will be chosen as the attack due to its astronomical power. Against Imposter users, try to fish for a burn from Steam Eruption or pivot out with Volt Switch to do some chip damage and gain momentum. Scouting opposing sets, such as with Imposter, is important to determine if Primal Kyogre is capable of breaking through walls; for example, RegenVest Dialga is difficult for Primal Kyogre to break through without support, whereas offensive Dialga is 2HKOed. If the opposing Pokemon is faster or Primal Kyogre is unable to handle it, it is ideal to switch out to avoid damage. Do not let Primal Kyogre take any chip damage such as from entry hazards if it is trying to wallbreak effectively, as it needs to have maximum power Water Spout for many crucial benchmarks, so Wish passing and Z-Parting Shot can mitigate this somewhat. If needed, Primal Kyogre can be used to remove a dangerous threat such as Mega Mewtwo Y, as Steam Eruption can still OHKO it while its good bulk allows it to take a hit and retaliate. This is not recommended if you still need Primal Kyogre for wallbreaking later, however. Try to preserve Water Spout's PP, such as by clicking Ice Beam against Giratina, as the PP is very important. Watch out for Prankster Destiny Bond, as this could mean trading away an important wallbreaker that the opponent lacks a switch-in to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slow, bulky pivots such as Registeel, Mega Audino, and Mega Slowbro are crucial to bring this set in safely to maintain Water Spout's power, and they also can sponge the opponent's hits when Primal Kyogre switches out. They also can force common defensive answers such as Magic Bounce Registeel and Mega Audino in, both of which Primal Kyogre is capable of OHKOing. Knock Off users such as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados are appreciated to remove Assault Vests from opposing Primal Kyogre and Giratina, which otherwise wall Primal Kyogre. They can also remove Imposter Chansey's Eviolite, which makes it much easier to chip down. Mega Tyranitar in particular can also threaten Giratina, one common answer to Kyogre. Entry hazard removers are very important to keep Primal Kyogre healthy, and good examples include Magic Bounce Giratina and Magearna. Conversely, hazard setters are appreciated to ease the matchup against bulky switch-ins like Primal Kyogre and Giratina while chipping Imposter users every time they attempt to switch in. Wish passers like Zygarde-C and Z-Parting Shot users such as Soundproof Mega Slowbro can give Primal Kyogre a second chance at breaking by restoring chipped health. Zygarde-C can also remove hazards while Mega Slowbro is a very slow pivot. Depending on the set, Pokemon to Imposter-proof Primal Kyogre such as RegenVest Primal Kyogre and Red Orb Groudon are needed, as this Primal Kyogre set cannot damage Imposter users too much and will require a teammate that can switch in after they come in. A Pokemon that can lure or remove Imposter is valuable by removing an important defensive switch-in. Examples include defensive Pokemon that can trap and PP-stall Imposter users, Mega Gengar, and Poison Heal Regigigas or Xerneas. Toxic Spikes are very helpful, as they deter Imposter and also pressure other switch-ins such as Primal Kyogre and Giratina.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Primal Groudon is a powerful bulky attacker when equipped with Red Orb, which leaves it with only a Ground-type weakness and a STAB V-create that can OHKO even relatively bulky targets that take neutral damage, such as Mega Audino, Xerneas, and Mega Mewtwo X. It is also offensively versatile, with a wide choice of viable coverage moves such as Fleur Cannon and Bolt Strike that enable it to lure in and weaken otherwise reliable checks such as Giratina and Celesteela, respectively. Its base 180 Attack and base 150 Special Attack are excellent for mixed attacking sets as well, and Desolate Land's Water immunity gives Primal Groudon more opportunities to switch in. Excellent bulk and typing also let it tank hits from powerful attackers, such as Primal Kyogre, Mega Diancie, and Regigigas, and OHKO them back. However, it is initially quite slow, so it struggles against faster Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Kyurem-W that target its weaker special bulk. It also is normally checked by some ubiquitous defensive Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Giratina, but though it bypass them with the appropriate coverage moves on mixed sets or force them to switch in and give momentum to the Primal Groudon user. Lastly, it is fairly one-dimensional, as its item and ability are restricted to Red Orb and Desolate Land, though it still carries staggering power despite these limitations.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>More offensive teams can opt for Morning Sun, which has half the PP of Shore Up but heals more HP per use. Knock Off or Poison Fang can be run to cripple common switch-ins such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Mega Slowbro. A Shift Gear set with Thousand Arrows, V-create, and a recovery move can sweep late-game but is forced out by too many threats such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Imposter to be reliable. Primal Groudon can forego Primal Reversion with a Leftovers + Fur Coat set to become a physical wall with an Electric immunity that can trap its Imposter with Thousand Waves. However, while it does not have the 4x Ice-type weakness of Zygarde-C, some common physical attackers like Adaptability Mega Mewtwo X and Refrigerate users still beat it. Mega Swampert can take hits from Kyurem-B better due to its additional Water typing but has lower overall physical bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types</strong>: Prankster variants of Giratina and Zygarde-C have enough bulk to take V-create and can use Haze to remove any Shell Smash or Download boosts Primal Groudon has accumulated. Other variants are generally safe switch-ins but can lose to Shell Smash Primal Groudon, especially with entry hazards up. Assault Vest variants of both Dragon-types can take a +2 Fleur Cannon or Ice Beam from full HP and use Spectral Thief to steal Primal Groudon's boosts. Non-Prankster Giratina may not survive +3 Precipice Blades, however.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Several faster special attackers can check unboosted Primal Groudon after it gets a KO. Kyurem-W OHKOes Primal Groudon with Refrigerate Boomburst, regardless of whether or not the former runs a boosting item. Normalize Mega Gengar threatens to render Primal Groudon impotent with Entrainment. Primordial Sea Ash-Greninja forces out Primal Groudon with its Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Imposter</strong>: Shell Smash Primal Groudon is very vulnerable to Imposter users, and finding a Pokemon that can wall its most effective moveset is difficult. While Imposter users must switch out after discovering Anchor Shot sets or be trapped and PP stalled, if they run Shed Shell, they can easily PP stall Primal Groudon or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Defensive sets of Primal Groudon should be wary of Mega Garchomp. Mega Garchomp outspeeds Primal Groudon that has not set up and threatens defensive sets out with its Ground-type STAB moves. Its common sets also prove troublesome to many common teammates that Primal Groudon works well alongside, and it can even take a single V-create. Primal Groudon is 2HKOed by Mega Diancie's Precipice Blades without an Impish nature, allowing Mega Diancie to easily PP stall Primal Groudon's recovery move if Precipice Blades doesn't miss. Zygarde-C often runs Thousand Waves and can survive V-create, letting it trap and KO Primal Groudon. Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y OHKOes Primal Groudon with Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Shedinja</strong>: Sturdy Shedinja walls most of Primal Groudon's attacks, but Primal Groudon can use Will-O-Wisp on it and can often force Stealth Rock up against Shedinja's teammates, making it difficult to switch Shedinja in. Shell Smash sets are usually helpless against Sturdy Shedinja, however.</p> <p><strong>Other Prankster Users</strong>: Prankster users such as Registeel and Aegislash can threaten to trade themselves for Shell Smash Primal Groudon with Destiny Bond, but defensive sets can just use these passive walls as opportunities to set up Stealth Rock or use Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Fire-immune Steel-types</strong>: Flash Fire Steel-types such as Registeel and Ferrothorn can be very annoying to defensive Primal Groudon sets. Given a safe switch, they can recover any damage done to them and proceed to trap Primal Groudon. However, they risk losing to Precipice Blades and Shell Smash variants. Primordial Sea Celesteela works similarly, but it fears Thousand Arrows and Shell Smash-boosted Power Trip.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>V-create deals fatal damage to targets that do not resist it such as Dialga, Mega Audino, and Xerneas, letting Primal Groudon check these threats. Shore Up keeps Primal Groudon's HP high, letting it continually check threatening Pokemon such as Regigigas and Mega Diancie. It has double the PP of Morning Sun, making it preferable for longer games. Stealth Rock is also viable, as Primal Groudon forces many switches, and the move gives it something to do as Prankster Dragon-types such as Giratina and Zygarde-C switch in. Alternatively, Bolt Strike deals heavy damage to Mega Slowbro, Celesteela, Ho-Oh, and other Fire-immune Steel-types like Celesteela. When boosted by Electric Terrain, Bolt Strike is a 2HKO against Mega Slowbro. Anchor Shot traps some defensive switch-ins, such as Primordial Sea Celesteela, Mega Slowbro, and Ho-Oh, preventing them from escaping the followup move. It also threatens to trap Imposter users that are not running Shed Shell, preventing them from safely switching into or staying in against Primal Groudon. Will-O-Wisp deals useful chip damage to common switch-ins such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Mega Slowbro and KOes Sturdy Shedinja. Thousand Arrows may be run instead of Bolt Strike as another strong STAB move that can invalidate Ho-Oh and Celesteela as checks. Primal Groudon can set other entry hazards such as Spikes if your team already has a Stealth Rock setter, but this mandates a Magic Bounce teammate to prevent Imposters from doing the same.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate can soften physical blows the first time Primal Groudon comes in, allowing it to be a better check to some physical attackers that might otherwise deal fatal damage to it, such as opposing Primal Groudon. Electric Surge powers up Bolt Strike and prevents Primal Groudon from being put to sleep. Lastly, Download is useful if Primal Groudon gets an Attack raise, but this boost is often removed or stolen by its counters via Haze or Spectral Thief. Red Orb gives Primal Groudon a far more useful defensive typing, higher physical bulk, and greater power behind its attacks. An Impish nature is preferred to bolster Primal Groudon's Defense so it can better take boosted and super effective hits, notably guaranteeing that it survives Regigigas's +1 Facade after Stealth Rock damage and giving it a good chance to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Diancie's Precipice Blades. A Careful nature allows Primal Groudon to handle Mega Diancie's Boomburst better but results in Primal Groudon being 2HKOed by Precipice Blades on the switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Primal Groudon set usually plays as a defensive pivot by forcing switches that its teammates can capitalize on. Early-game, Anchor Shot is a risk-free move to click, as the only common Pokemon that can safely avoid being trapped are Zygarde-C, Giratina, Shed Shell Imposter users, and Flash Fire Aegislash. Giratina is a fairly passive Pokemon and Aegislash cannot risk taking a possible Ground-type attack, but Primal Groudon should scout Imposter users for a possible Shed Shell, which can cause them to deplete Primal Groudon's PP if they successfully trap Primal Groudon. Most other switch-ins can easily be trapped and then removed the next turn with Bolt Strike or have Stealth Rock set up on them as they pivot out. If running Stealth Rock, it is important to scout for Magic Bounce Pokemon by using Will-O-Wisp if Primal Groudon has it or by analyzing how your opponent responds to Primal Groudon. Most teams are forced to switch the same Pokemon into Primal Groudon as it comes in, making your opponent more predictable. You can use this tendency to dictate your opponent's plays, maintain momentum, and wear their team down with entry hazard damage and double switches. Be mindful of the low PP of V-create and Bolt Strike, as after either move is used up, Primal Groudon becomes far easier to switch into for the opponent. If you need Primal Groudon to check a threatening Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Mega Beedrill, or a Poison Heal user like Regigigas or Xerneas, play more carefully with it and ensure that its HP stays high enough to take them on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits on many balance teams thanks to its ability to force predictable switches. Powerful special or mixed wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Mega Diancie, Ash-Greninja, and Pixilate Mega Mewtwo X can threaten Primal Groudon's common checks such as Shedinja, Zygarde-C, Flash Fire Steel-types, Mega Garchomp, and Giratina, and they appreciate Primal Groudon trapping and KOing their standard defensive answers such as Soundproof Mega Slowbro and Celesteela. Primal Groudon can Imposter-proof Mega Diancie and Ash-Greninja if they do not carry a Ground-type attack, as well as Pixilate Mega Mewtwo X. Setup checks such as Prankster Zygarde-C, Prankster + Haze Registeel, and Choice Scarf Imposter users can give the team a safety net against unexpected setup Pokemon, allowing Primal Groudon to play more defensively against setup-heavy teams. RegenVest Pokemon such as Dialga and Primal Kyogre check special attackers and pivot Primal Groudon in safely with U-turn. Poison Heal users such as Xerneas, Mega Tyranitar, and Regigigas provide an additional layer of protection against status, can remove items such as Shed Shell and Leftovers with Knock Off, and spread their own status to help Primal Groudon, while Primal Groudon can check powerful wallbreakers that might force them out. If Primal Groudon is running Stealth Rock, a Magic Bounce teammate that resists V-create such as Zygarde-C or Giratina can prevent Imposters from setting up Stealth Rock against your team.</p>"
      },
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash sets Primal Groudon up to sweep the opposing team and outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. V-create deals enormous damage to targets neutral to it such as Mega Audino and Arceus, and, at +2, it can even land OHKOs on targets that resist it such as Primal Kyogre and Mega Gyarados. However, the Speed- and Defense-lowering effects leave Primal Groudon slightly more vulnerable to revenge killing from Choice Scarf and priority users. Thousand Arrows allows Primal Groudon to hit Flying-types with its STAB Ground-type move and has respectable power at +2. Alternatively, Precipice Blades has a noticeably higher damage output against bulky neutral targets such as Flash Fire Ferrothorn but cannot hit Flying-types, which may allow a daring opponent to more easily pivot around Primal Groudon with immunities. +2 Precipice Blades also is a guaranteed OHKO against both Mega Mewtwo formes, sparing Primal Groudon from having to use V-create on them. Power Trip is another option that hits Mega Slowbro, Giratina, Ho-Oh, Flash Fire Celesteela, and Flash Fire Ferrothorn hard. Fleur Cannon is the best move to complement Fire-type coverage, severely damaging physically defensive Pokemon that can take Thousand Arrows and V-create such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Mega Slowbro. +2 Fleur Cannon has a chance to OHKO non-Assault Vest Giratina after Stealth Rock damage. Ice Beam is viable alongside Power Trip, as it hits Dragon- and Ground-types super effectively, notably OHKOing Zygarde-C at +2 regardless of its set. However, Primal Groudon loses the ability to OHKO Giratina. Core Enforcer can allow Primal Groudon to stay in against Prankster + Haze Dragon-types such as Zygarde-C, though Primal Groudon will take severe damage from the opponent's Core Enforcer if it sets up a second time, and its ability will be suppressed, degrading V-create's power. Bonemerang is another niche option that allows Primal Groudon to break through Focus Sash and Substitute users, but it is only marginally more powerful than Thousand Arrows and has lower accuracy.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>It is best to use a Naughty nature so that Primal Groudon's offenses are not degraded. Most priority moves are physical, and Primal Groudon can tank a few of them if it's healthy. Primal Groudon is still able to outspeed base 140 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Mewtwo Y, after Shell Smash followed by a Speed drop from V-create. Even with a Naughty nature, Primal Groudon is still able to survive special priority moves from full HP. Red Orb is mandatory for Primal Reversion, which increases Primal Groudon's Attack, Defense, and subpar Special Attack. Download gives Primal Groudon a boost to one of its offensive stats, which synergizes well with Shell Smash. +3 Special Attack is enough to OHKO all variants of Giratina with Fleur Cannon except Assault Vest ones, which can still be KOed after Stealth Rock damage. +3 Attack allows Primal Groudon to OHKO non-Fur Coat Giratina with Precipice Blades.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set operates mainly as a late-game sweeper, but against teams without reliable checks to it, it can be used as a wallbreaker or an emergency check to a physical attacker. It is a good idea to keep Primal Groudon healthy enough to take priority moves such as Fake Out + Extreme Speed from Kyurem-B. Scout for status moves such as Mega Steelix's Glare and Assault Vest users' Poison Fang so that Primal Groudon does not recklessly switch into them and get crippled. Slow pivots are great for scouting for such moves and can get Primal Groudon in safely throughout the game, and Primal Groudon's threatening presence and low list of switch-ins help to maintain momentum. Utilize entry hazard damage and make offensive double switches to wear down Primal Groudon's checks, such as Giratina and Zygarde-C. Several other sorts of checks must be dealt with as well. Prankster users can remove Primal Groudon's boosts, shut it down with Encore, or force an unfavorable trade with Destiny Bond. Focus Sash users with Spectral Thief such as Mega Mewtwo X can stop Primal Groudon's sweep as well and must be worn down before Primal Groudon can sweep.</p> <p>Once Primal Groudon's checks have been dealt with, pivot Primal Groudon in against something that it forces out, such as a Steel-type, for a free setup turn. Be very wary of Imposter users, because they can easily countersweep or, at best, force a two-for-one trade with your Prankster Destiny Bond user. Try not to reveal Primal Groudon's set to Imposter users before it is ready to set up, as your opponent will then be unsure of what they must preserve to check it. If you have a teammate to Imposter-proof this set, keep it alive to protect yourself from being counterswept by Imposters. Be careful of faster attackers such as priority and Choice Scarf users, which can accumulate significant chip damage on Primal Groudon after its defenses have been lowered with Shell Smash or or V-create. Do not be afraid to switch Primal Groudon out after it sets up and KOes a Pokemon to save it for later, as its bulk, especially physically, is surprisingly good and might allow it to set up again.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Primal Groudon set functions as a late-game sweeper and cleaner for both offensive and balance teams, as it can easily gain a free turn to set up. Wallbreakers are key to setting the stage for its sweep. Examples include Mega Garchomp and Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X. These Pokemon can chip Primal Groudon's standard checks such as Giratina and Zygarde-C into KO range of Fleur Cannon or Ice Beam, force trades with Prankster users, defeat Sturdy Shedinja with Moongeist Beam or Photon Geyser, and wear down Imposter users that switch in to scout their sets. Imposter-proofing this set depends entirely on the coverage. For example, Shedinja can Imposter-proof all variants and keep up pressure by using U-turn on the Imposter's forced switch. Primordial Sea Celesteela can handle variants with Precipice Blades. Hyper offensive teams may not want to lose momentum switching into an Imposter-proofer, so a Focus Sash user such as Magic Guard Mega Diancie can use Spectral Thief to steal the boosts from an Imposter that copies Primal Groudon and continue sweeping with them. Offensive entry hazard setters like Stealth Rock Mega Diancie, Mold Breaker Spikes Mega Gengar, Spikes Kartana, and Spikes Xerneas can help weaken walls and break Focus Sashes with their hazards. Kartana and Mold Breaker Gengar with Pursuit can threaten Shedinja, one of the most reliable checks to this set. Flash Fire Steel-types like Registeel can switch into -ate users and threaten to trap Imposters that switch into them, both of which are otherwise threatening to Primal Groudon. Another setup sweeper such as Shell Smash Mega Tyranitar, Shell Smash Mega Gengar, or Belly Drum Necrozma-DM can finish sweeping where Primal Groudon leaves off if it is somehow KOed. Since many teams carry just a single Prankster user, trading for it can allow the other sweeper to sweep unhindered. Mega Tyranitar and Necrozma-DM can also weaken walls like Giratina and Zygarde-C early-game so Primal Groudon can KO them later. Bulky entry hazard control Pokemon such as Defog Giratina and Pixilate Rapid Spin Mega Diancie are useful as partners to allow Primal Groudon to survive priority moves. They can also pivot Primal Groudon in with a slow U-turn and absorb status moves aimed at your offensive Pokemon. Giratina can also opt to run Z-Parting Shot to give Primal Groudon a second chance at sweeping. A way to offensively check Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar is useful, as they heavily damage and outspeed Primal Groudon before it sets up. Choice Scarf Adaptability Mega Gengar and Tough Claws Mega Beedrill check these threats and can use U-turn on predicted switches. Choice Band Adaptability Mega Tyranitar can Pursuit trap Giratina, Mega Gengar, and Mega Mewtwo Y to help Primal Groudon.</p>"

  "Dialga": {
    "overview": "<p>Dialga is a slow powerhouse that has good offensive stats and decent defensive stats, allowing it to run both offensive and defensive sets. With an offensive set, Dialga can pressure the opponent with STAB Doom Desire and wallbreak late-game with Tail Glow boosts, setting up on various Steel-types, Water-types, and slow Pokemon like Mega Audino. Because Dialga isn't weak to Fire, it doesn't feel obliged to run Flash Fire on its sets like other Steel-types, giving it the option to run other abilities instead. Defensively, its RegenVest set easily fits onto many team archetypes because it can remove entry hazards, steal boosts with Spectral Thief, disable the foe's ability, paralyze the foe, and most importantly, pivot out. Also, thanks to its Steel / Dragon typing, Dialga serves as a nice check to many top threats in the metagame, namely Mega Mewtwo Y, Primal Kyogre, and Normal-types. The efficacy of these sets, however, depends also on the level of support Dialga can get from its teammates. Its offensive sets require a lot of support due to how easily they can be revenge killed. When using Dialga, you should always be wary of Fighting- and Ground-type attackers like Mega Mewtwo X and Red Orb Groudon and should play accordingly. Pokemon with common Ground and Fighting coverage such as Precipice Blades Mega Diancie and Secret Sword Mega Mewtwo Y can threaten Dialga. Also, Dialga's offensive sets are hindered by the passive mechanics of Doom Desire and Dialga's relatively slow base 90 Speed. Despite all this, Dialga still manages to be extremely useful in the right circumstances and should not be underestimated.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Adamant Orb is an option on the Doom Desire set, but Dialga appreciates the utility of Corkscrew Crash, so it's best to only use Adamant Orb if you need the Z-Crystal on another Pokemon. The power boost granted can be helpful against targets such as Zygarde-C and Giratina, but it can be removed with Knock Off. Leftovers provides passive recovery for the Doom Desire sets and can assist in stalling for turns while Doom Desire hits, but it poses the same issues as the Adamant Orb does due to the lack of Corkscrew Crash. Doom Desire Dialga can run a Quiet nature with minimum Speed investment to attempt to underspeed targets with Spectral Thief, but a lot of walls still underspeed it regardless like Mega Audino and Registeel. Mold Breaker allows Doom Desire Dialga to break past Unaware Pokemon more easily and beat Shedinja, but it's very niche, as it's difficult to Imposter-proof without using Substitute Fairy-types. Adaptability boosts the power of STAB moves for Dialga's Doom Desire set, but it's only worth using if Dialga runs Core Enforcer too, as Steelworker makes Doom Desire stronger than Adaptability does. Anchor Shot is an option for the Doom Desire set over Tail Glow to PP stall Imposter users, but the set will be significantly weaker. U-turn is an option on the Doom Desire set, but Doom Desire sets struggle with four-moveslot syndrome.</p> <p>Dragon Tail allows Dialga to phaze targets on the RegenVest set, but the moveset is already cramped and Dragon Tail is only worth it with entry hazard stacking. Knock Off is an option on the RegenVest variant and can hit Mega Mewtwo Y super effectively, but Dialga needs to worry about Imposter users removing its Assault Vest. Metal Burst is another option for RegenVest, as it can hit foes like a truck and works especially well for targets that 2HKO Dialga such as Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y, but the opponent will often play less aggressively against Dialga afterward, so it may not get much use. It does synergize well with Dialga's minimal Speed investment for that set, however. Other than that, RegenVest Dialga tends to be limited in its moveset because it holds an Assault Vest, and as such it can be one-dimensional at times.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Dialga generally doesn't run Sunsteel Strike or Mold Breaker and Shedinja underspeeds, making Core Enforcer useless. Any attack that Dialga hits Shedinja with is just shrugged off by Sturdy, and Shedinja can retaliate with Endeavor.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mewtwo X</strong>: Mega Mewtwo X takes little damage from unboosted Dialga, while most variants of it OHKO it back easily. Dazzling and -ate variants have a good chance to OHKO Dialga with Close Combat, while Poison Heal variants have the same chances with Superpower and Low Kick. Technician and Choice Band variants easily get a guaranteed OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mega Garchomp can't switch in, but walls can take advantage of Dialga's Speed to pivot into Mega Garchomp, which can in turn OHKO Dialga with ease. Primal Groudon doesn't like the risk of losing Desolate Land but can set up on RegenVest variants or just OHKO the Doom Desire ones. Zygarde-C doesn't like taking Core Enforcer, but Dialga doesn't like taking Thousand Arrows or Thousand Waves unless it's Fur Coat.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Pokemon</strong>: Primal Kyogre with Unaware is one Pokemon that can counter Dialga. Both sets lose to it, as Doom Desire from Tinted Lens Dialga fails to 2HKO Primal Kyogre and RegenVest often ends up just pivoting out. There are other Unaware users that can take its attacks, such as Mega Gyarados and Chansey, but none of them counter Dialga as well as Primal Kyogre does.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Pokemon with Strong Coverage</strong>: Despite Dialga's bulk, it can be still overwhelmed by some Pokemon. Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y can use Earth Power repeatedly to break through even RegenVest Dialga, while Choice Band Mega Tyranitar and Choice Band Kartana can beat Dialga with respectively Close Combat and V-create.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: RegenVest Dialga has difficulty dealing with Steel-types in particular, and it's not uncommon for Dialga to get into stall wars with opposing RegenVest Steel-types. They resist both of Dialga's STAB move types and pretty much all of them underspeed Dialga, which is bad when Dialga wants to pivot.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: While Dialga isn't walled as hard by Water-types, Primal Kyogre, Mega Gyarados, and more niche ones like Mega Swampert can still take Dialga's attacks. Primal Kyogre flat-out walls RegenVest Dialga and Quiver Dance sets can threaten the Doom Desire set, but RegenVest Dialga can wall Primal Kyogre too unless the Primal Kyogre has Tinted Lens. Mega Gyarados can force out RegenVest Dialga with the threat of Knock Off, and while some sets are checked by Doom Desire, namely Fur Coat, the Choice Band, Unaware, and Unburden sets are not. Mega Swampert can threaten Dialga with Thousand Waves and usually runs Topsy-Turvy to prevent Doom Desire from beating it. All of these with the exception of Unaware Kyogre take fairly significant damage from Tail Glow-boosted Core Enforcer, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Doom Desire": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Doom Desire is an extremely powerful Steel-type move that hits two turns after being used, allowing Dialga to play mind games and put tons of pressure on the opponent. Doom Desire also discourages certain Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Mega Audino, and Giratina from switching in immediately, encouraging Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo X to come in. Tail Glow boosts Dialga's Special Attack by three stages and goes well with Doom Desire as next to nothing can take a +3 Doom Desire. Core Enforcer is Dialga's Dragon-type STAB move as it is the most reliable special Dragon-type move with no drawbacks and can also disable the enemy's abilities if Dialga moves last. Though the move is mainly used for damage because of Dialga's Speed investments, it does allow Dialga to force even faster foes out by disabling their abilities, like Poison Heal for example, which works well in conjunction with using Doom Desire. Draco Meteor hits significantly harder than Core Enforcer, but this comes at the cost of lowering Dialga's Special Attack. Doom Desire and Dragon STAB make Dialga a powerful offensive threat, as next to nothing can take a +3 Doom Desire and a +3 Core Enforcer together as they both already deal massive damage individually. Shore Up keeps Dialga healthy for longer, allowing it to break through more walls and assist its teammates more often with Doom Desire. Dialga can also use King's Shield or Baneful Bunker over Shore Up or Core Enforcer, but it will lose out on longevity or wallbreaking power, respectively. King's Shield weakens physical attackers and can prevent U-turns while Baneful Bunker can wear down non-Steel type walls and Shedinja. King's Shield is generally preferred as it has a better effect against Poison Heal users and Steel-types, though King's Shield does not block status moves. These options allow Dialga to last even longer and give it the option to stall for turns while waiting for Doom Desire to hit, which can be especially useful after spending one turn using Tail Glow. Otherwise, Shore Up is preferred for longevity over these moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Steelium Z allows Dialga to attack immediately with a 200-Base Power Corkscrew Crash, nailing opponents that think they're safe before Doom Desire hits and dealing massive damage to almost any opponent due to its ability. Due to Z-Moves being unaffected by Normalize, it can also hit Normalize Mega Gengar after it uses Entrainment. Safety Goggles can also be used to block the use of Spore, which makes Dialga more effective against Spore users like Xerneas and Mega Sceptile and lets it block hail damage and other powder moves. However, Safety Goggles Dialga is still vulnerable to Lovely Kiss and must be wary of Knock Off users such as Poison Heal Regigigas and Poison Heal Slaking. For its ability, Tinted Lens allows Dialga to heavily pressure balanced and stall teams by hitting extremely common Steel-resistant Pokemon like Registeel and Primal Kyogre significantly harder, possibly even OHKOing them with Doom Desire after a Tail Glow boost. Steelworker lets Dialga's Doom Desire hit the neutral and weak targets more commonly found on offensive teams harder. It also allows Corkscrew Crash to do a ridiculous amount of damage even without a Tail Glow boost. Magic Bounce allows Dialga to check certain Pokemon like Regigigas better as Dialga can bounce back their Spore, eliminating the need for Safety Goggles. It also bounces back Entrainment from Mega Gengar and various Steel-types as well as Topsy-Turvy. Fur Coat is an option that allows Dialga to stay in against a wider group of Pokemon. With doubled Defense, many 2HKOs will turn into 3HKOs and Dialga can set up against more Pokemon. Finally, Modest is used to maximize Dialga's Special Attack and make it as powerful as possible. You can also opt to run Bold, but you may resort to using Tail Glow more often to make up for lost power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Doom Desire only has 8 PP, so use it wisely. Dialga can use Tail Glow before Doom Desire hits in order to wallbreak by itself, or it can switch out to a teammate such as Mega Mewtwo X to support their wallbreaking ability, scare out Pokemon like Xerneas, and put immense pressure on the opponent. The latter plan of action is generally preferred early-game. Due to Doom Desire's unique mechanic of a delayed hit, Dialga can also opt to cast the move and then setup afterwards. Alternatively, because Doom Desire hits at the end of the second turn, Dialga can also attack in the beginning of the same turn or the following turn to deal massive damage and break through walls. If Imposter Chansey or a Spectral Thief user is on the team, Dialga can either use Core Enforcer instead of Tail Glow or switch out after using Doom Desire. However, even coordinated attacks are not always enough, so only bring in Dialga on passive Pokemon you intend on breaking through. If you are using Magic Bounce, you can target even more opponents, as passive Pokemon often carry bounceable moves like Stealth Rock, Will-O-Wisp, and Entrainment. Do not waste Corkscrew Crash. If your opponent has a Normalize Mega Gengar, wait to use Corkscrew Crash as it remains Steel-type even through Normalize and Entrainment and can be used as a check. Otherwise, just wait until the opportune time to use it, such as when a Fairy-type switches into Dialga. A +3 Corkscrew Crash can obliterate anything that doesn't resist it, but just be wary of RegenVest Pokemon and Unaware users, as they can usually absorb the attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>To Imposter-proof Dialga, Substitute Fairy-types like Poison Heal Xerneas and Poison Heal Mega Diancie are offensive options, while Unaware Primal Kyogre, Unaware Chansey, and Unaware Mega Gyarados are defensive ones. Dialga needs a teammate that can switch into Fighting-type moves as having a check or counter to Mega Mewtwo X is absolutely essential. A Ghost-type such as Giratina or even bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia would work for this role. Dialga appreciates having another Steel-type such as Registeel and Flash Fire Solgaleo as support because it can't check Pixilate and Refrigerate Pokemon. Pokemon that can eliminate opposing offensive threats like -ate users in general do well with Dialga due to the fact that Dialga is not equipped to threaten these Pokemon and is subsequently forced out by them. Dialga pairs exceptionally well with other wallbreakers such as Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Diancie as they enjoy the pressure put on the opponent by the Doom Desire support. Lastly, entry hazard setters, especially those that can pressure Magic Bounce users, can drastically improve the effectiveness of Dialga as most things that normally wall it will get quickly worn down with entry hazard damage. Entry hazards also help against Sturdy Shedinja, one of Dialga's hard counters. Mega Diancie can pressure Magic Bounce Pokemon as well as Defoggers such as Giratina. Mega Diancie itself can also work as an offensive teammate as Dialga can also help Imposter-proof it with Doom Desire. Mold Breaker Pokemon like Mega Garchomp can bypass Magic Bounce entirely to set hazards. Mega Garchomp in particular also pairs well with Dialga as Dragon-types like Mega Garchomp can spam their Dragon-type STAB moves without worry of Fairy-types coming in while Doom Desire is active. Red Orb Groudon can threaten Magic Bounce users by reducing their longevity with Sacred Fire burns. More defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn can run Stealth Rock or Spikes as well, but these have a worse matchup against Magic Bounce users.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn lets Dialga pivot out to a more offensive Pokemon to gain momentum, which is good considering that Dialga is moderately slow. Core Enforcer is a 100-Base Power STAB attack that can negate the abilities of faster foes, which is especially handy considering that Dialga either underspeeds or Speed ties with many other Pokemon in the metagame, especially most Dragon-types bar Zygarde-C. Revelation Dance becomes Steel-type for Dialga and can hit Mega Gengar even after it changes Dialga's ability to Normalize. It also threatens Fairy-types like Mega Audino and Xerneas. Spectral Thief lets Dialga steal boosts from Pokemon utilizing setup moves to prevent Dialga from getting overpowered too quickly. It also hits Mega Mewtwo Y, Aegislash, and Mega Gengar, which Dialga checks decently well. Rapid Spin can be used to get rid of entry hazards, as Dialga is difficult to spinblock due to it threatening two of the three most common Ghost-types, namely Giratina and Mega Gengar. Nuzzle can be used to paralyze targets, but it makes Dialga more difficult to Imposter-proof.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Sassy nature lets Dialga maximize its Special Defense and minimize its Speed. That alongside 0 Speed IVs lets Dialga be as slow as possible to ensure Core Enforcer usually hits last, to prevent Dialga from getting its own ability disabled by other Core Enforcer users, and to let Dialga be a slow pivot. 16 Speed EVs with a Careful nature is an alternative option that allows Dialga to steal Shell Smash boosts from various Pokemon and outspeed everything up to Mega Mewtwo Y at +2 Speed, as it can survive attacks from quite a few Shell Smash users provided they don't have STAB Power Trip or super effective coverage against Dialga. Dialga trades the ability to use status moves for more Special Defense with its Assault Vest. With a 1.5x Special Defense, it can take on many special attackers in the tier such as Primal Kyogre, Mega Gengar, and Xerneas. Regenerator restores 33% of Dialga's HP every time it switches out, letting Dialga passively recover without wasting any turns. This works especially well with momentum moves like U-turn. Regenerator is an important ability on this set, as the passive healing makes up for Dialga's inability to use recovery moves because of its Assault Vest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>RegenVest Dialga counters most special attackers that don't have super effective coverage against it, such as Primal Kyogre without Tinted Lens, Normalize Mega Gengar, No Guard Mega Mewtwo Y, and Xerneas lacking Earth Power. Its improved bulk allows it to switch into these threats and then heal over the course of the match by pivoting or switching out. If Dialga is at low health, utilize free turns against passive Pokemon by switching Dialga in then double switching or using U-turn. Always use U-turn liberally, as oftentimes, once your opponent knows your Dialga is defensive, they'll attempt to bring in walls because they know Dialga won't be able to do too much aside from use Core Enforcer. If they bring in a wall on the same turn Dialga pivots, you can bring in a wallbreaker and maintain momentum. If you predict your opponent is going to bring in something frail, you can try to get a 2HKO or 3HKO using a STAB move. Be wary of Knock Off, however, as Dialga gets significantly weaker if its Assault Vest is removed, so be careful around common Knock Off users such as Mega Audino and Mega Tyranitar even if Dialga has the type advantage. Don't waste Core Enforcer's mere 16 PP, as the move serves both an offensive and utility purpose. If you can't knock something out, pivot to something that can, as Dialga's main role is to provide momentum for the team through pivoting.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Imposter Chansey can assist in scouting for sets that would threaten Dialga like Secret Sword Mega Mewtwo Y as well as various other threatening abilities like Adaptability. Dialga absolutely must have a teammate that can deal with Mega Mewtwo X, as Mega Mewtwo X can easily force out Dialga and set up if it predicts Dialga will switch. Mega Sableye, Giratina, and Mega Slowbro are all checks to Mega Mewtwo X. Zygarde-C can also beat most sets if it has Unaware or Prankster. It is also important to check Mega Diancie, as it is one of the few Fairy-types that can beat Dialga if it has Precipice Blades, and a Boomburst from Mega Diancie is a nearly guaranteed 2HKO with Stealth Rock damage. Ho-Oh beats the Pixilate variants of Mega Diancie, while Flash Fire Aegislash and Sturdy Shedinja beat Magic Guard variants. Red Orb Groudon can prevent Mega Diancie from becoming a problem, and it can also set entry hazards to beat one of Dialga's counters in Sturdy Shedinja. Red Orb Groudon also patches up any weaknesses against opposing Steel-types that Dialga faces and beats opposing RegenVest Pokemon with its powerful physical attacks. Besides Primal Groudon, Mega Mewtwo X can also deal with opposing Steel-types, as this variant of Dialga cannot threaten them at all.</p> <p>RegenVest Dialga can fit on many team archetypes as it can passively recover health and support its teammates by pivoting, and can be paired with decently frail sweepers and wallbreakers like Mega Mewtwo Y. It also pairs well with teammates like Slaking, Mega Sableye, and Zygarde-C that are normally forced out by powerful special attackers. Dialga hates Spikes as they limit its pivoting ability and prevent it from walling stronger attacks like Mega Diancie's Boomburst and Tinted Lens Primal Kyogre's Steam Eruption. Thus, if Dialga doesn't run Rapid Spin, another teammate should run Rapid Spin or Defog. Dialga appreciates something that can absorb Knock Off, as its ability to wall is severely hampered if it loses its Assault Vest. Griseous Orb Giratina, Red Orb Groudon, and Pokemon with Z-Crystals cannot have their items knocked off. Unaware users such as Primal Kyogre, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Audino are also appreciated partners to Dialga as they can beat the setup sweepers that Dialga struggles with. This set is relatively easy to Imposter-proof, as many special walls like Primal Kyogre can easily switch into Imposter users transformed into Dialga, but a drawback is that Imposter users can come in and heal for free, which is why you may want something that can both switch in and force out Imposter Pokemon. A teammate with Poison Heal can help alleviate any issues with Nuzzle spreading status and Poison Heal also soaks other statuses that Dialga is weak to such as sleep from Spore. If you are not running Nuzzle, you can opt for a Safety Goggles teammate instead to check Spore users like Xerneas.</p>"

  "Regigigas": {
    "overview": "<p>Regigigas sets itself apart from other Poison Heal users with its mono-Normal typing that grants it an immunity to Spectral Thief and, combined with its solid bulk, provides it with ample opportunities to set up against various foes and take advantage of passive Pokemon in the metagame. Facade threatens all offensive teams after a single boost and generates additional setup opportunities against them. While Normal does not provide good coverage offensively, Regigigas can simply overpower foes that resist Facade by putting them to sleep and setting up multiple boosts. This leaves Regigigas as a notable threat for defensive teams as well, as Unaware users that can take on a boosted Regigigas risk being put to sleep and left vulnerable, while very few foes that run Magic Bounce can take Regigigas's boosted Facade. On top of this, Regigigas is able to easily defeat Imposter users by removing their Eviolite with Knock Off and taking advantage of its status-boosted Facade and pseudo-immunity to sleep-inducing moves that its Imposters are vulnerable to. All of these factors combine to make Regigigas a threat that has very narrow and specific defensive counterplay options that force opponents to react defensively to it, generating predictable moves from foes for Regigigas's teammates to capitalize on. However, Regigigas fails to provide much defensive utility to the team due to its lack of resistances and immunities apart from an immunity to Ghost-type attacks. Also, the prevalence of Core Enforcer and Entrainment means Regigigas's setup opportunities are somewhat limited. Due to the fact that Regigigas is one-dimensional as an offensive threat and requires a dedicated Pokemon to check it, most competitive teams have adapted to its presence and commonly employ checks like Giratina, Fur Coat users, and Steel-types with Magic Bounce, all of which Regigigas struggles to break past.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Regigigas can various moves to bypass some of its checks. Thousand Arrows lets Regigigas hit Steel-types and Mega Diancie super effectively and notably gives it a chance to defeat Poison Heal variants of Mega Tyranitar. Taunt prevents Entrainment and recovery from problematic defensive roadblocks such as Giratina, but this involves prediction and forces Regigigas to forgo a sleep-inducing move, worsening its overall ability to take advantage of passive threats. Taunt also makes Regigigas's matchup against Imposter users somewhat risky and dependent on a Speed tie. Sunsteel Strike hits Mega Tyranitar, OHKOes Mega Diancie, and KOes Sturdy Shedinja but has no other viable use. Dragon Tail is another option to deal with Dragon-types with Core Enforcer, but the move is weak even with boosts from Shift Gear and leaves Regigigas hopelessly walled by Aegislash if it forgoes Knock Off. Regigigas can afford to utilize Mold Breaker to revenge kill faster Dazzling and Queenly Majesty users with STAB Fake Out and Extreme Speed in a similar vein as -ate users, but this set is very matchup reliant, fails to do any meaningful damage to Ghost-types, and is vulnerable to Imposter. Using Belly Drum in tandem with Unburden and Sitrus Berry can function as a decent late-game cleaner because Regigigas's STAB Extreme Speed does sizable damage to many foes and is faster than Prankster moves. However, this set has rather inadequate coverage options to hit common defensive walls in the metagame and is vulnerable to -ate users, meaning other threats like Kartana outclass Regigigas in this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Giratina and Mega Sableye</strong>: Giratina is by far the strongest counter to Regigigas available thanks to its Ghost typing that grants it immunity to Facade, colossal defensive stats, and ability to viably equip Griseous Orb or a Z-Crystal, which allows it to take minimal damage from Knock Off and use Core Enforcer to end Regigigas's sweep. However, if Giratina has not opted for Magic Bounce, Comatose, or Fur Coat, it might find itself getting overwhelmed by a boosted Spectral Thief during multiple turns of sleep. Poison Heal variants are harder to pressure due to their passive recovery and pseudo-immunity to sleep-inducing moves. Mega Sableye may be less bulkier than Giratina, but it can easily take on Regigigas due to its neutrality to Knock Off and can improve the matchup with Poison Heal.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Steel-types</strong>: Regigigas's tendency to rely on sleep-inducing moves to bypass foes that resist Facade leaves the likes of Magic Bounce Registeel, Celesteela, and Mega Steelix as good checks, as they often have a dedicated way to shut down Regigigas, such as through Core Enforcer and Topsy-Turvy.</p> <p><strong>Fur Coat Users</strong>: The aforementioned Steel-types can take on boosted Regigigas easily with Fur Coat, even when accounting for sleep turns. Other Fur Coat users like Zygarde-C can take multiple boosted Facades and retaliate with Core Enforcer. However, these foes tend to yield momentum to Regigigas due to their vulnerability to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Shedinja</strong>: Due to the fact that Regigigas cannot viably opt for an attack or coverage move to defeat Sturdy Shedinja, it finds itself walled and forced out due to the threat of Endeavor. However, Shedinja does not like being put to sleep or losing important items like Protective Pads and Safety Goggles to Knock Off when switching in.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Mega Tyranitar, especially if it is the Poison Heal variant, can go toe to toe with Regigigas by using Shift Gear itself and can gain the upper hand in one on one scenarios due to a potential Defense boost from Diamond Storm. Mega Diancie, while it is going to be heavily impaired in the process, can survive a boosted Facade and revenge kill a weakened Regigigas with a Pixilate-boosted Boomburst followed by Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Core Enforcer and Entrainment</strong>: As Regigigas is reliant on Poison Heal's passive recovery to function, practically any foe is capable of blanket checking Regigigas with Core Enforcer and Entrainment, as long as they aren't too pressured by Facade or sleep-inducing moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Due to Regigigas's lack of resistances, it may be overwhelmed by extremely powerful attacks from faster threats such as Choice Specs Mega Diancie, Focus Blast Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y, and any Mega Mewtwo X variant, all of which can OHKO Regigigas. However, none of them can take on a boosted Regigigas due to +1 Facade dealing huge damage, Knock Off removing their boosting item, and Spore preventing them from moving.</p> <p><strong>Misty Surge</strong>: Misty Surge prevents Regigigas from turning foes into setup fodder with its sleep-inducing moves, making it far easier to check with Pokemon that previously could not reliably check it.</p>",

      "Poison Heal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shift Gear fixes Regigigas's average Speed by increasing it to the point where it outpaces the entire unboosted metagame and increases its Attack stat, letting it OHKO most neutral offensive foes with Facade after Stealth Rock damage. Facade is Regigigas's primary STAB move that becomes immensely powerful after Regigigas has successfully activated its Toxic Orb. It also notably leaves Imposter users with only a 70-Base Power STAB attack due to them not being able to independently poison themselves. The third moveslot is filled with a sleep-inducing move, as it helps Regigigas bypass Focus Sash holders with some chance, defeat Imposter users, eliminate defensive foes that can handle Facade, and provide an extra turn of passive recovery. Spore is a reliable option because it cannot miss, and it synergizes well with Knock Off, as the attack can remove Safety Goggles. Lovely Kiss is an alternative option to be used when Regigigas does not opt for Knock Off that enables Regigigas to put Grass-type foes to sleep, prevents Kartana from easily revenge killing it, and reduces Ferrothorn's efficiency as a check. Knock Off rounds off Regigigas's coverage by allowing it to hit Ghost-types like Giratina and Aegislash super effectively while also being useful in removing items like Safety Goggles and Eviolite and in scouting for potential Z-Crystals. The removal of Safety Goggles is especially appreciated, as this lets Regigigas use Spore more freely. Spectral Thief, on the other hand, consistently hits Ghost-types hard and lets Regigigas shut down a boosted foe if it can survive a hit and hit back, and it is best used with Lovely Kiss or teammates with Knock Off so that Regigigas can set up on foes with Safety Goggles. It also notably improves Regigigas's matchup against other setup sweepers like Poison Heal variants of Primal Kyogre and Mega Tyranitar. On the other hand, Avalanche can be used to prevent Core Enforcer from suppressing Poison Heal and hit Giratina and Zygarde-C super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Toxic Orb poisons Regigigas at the end of the turn, letting it utilize Poison Heal to gain passive recovery each turn, gain a pseudo-immunity to malicious status ailments, and use an empowered Facade to defeat Imposter users. A Jolly nature allows Regigigas to outspeed as many foes as possible, including base 90 Speed Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Dialga. An Adamant nature is an alternative option to improve Regigigas's damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Regigigas is able to switch into weak attacks from passive walls such as Registeel and Mega Audino, it should enter the field with caution before it has successfully activated Toxic Orb, as being afflicted by other status or getting hit by Knock Off significantly hampers its usefulness. Moves that Regigigas can switch into include predicted uses of recovery moves, weak attacks, and Spectral Thief. In this regard, it should only be switched in by slow pivoting moves or when the opponent is sure to switch their Pokemon out. However, Regigigas can be used more liberally to absorb status once it has been poisoned. Do not underestimate Regigigas's bulk; while it lacks resistances, it only has a sole weakness to Fighting-type attacks. Regigigas may sustain damage while setting up, but it will regain its health with Poison Heal recovery, which comes into play often with Regigigas's ability to induce sleep and force switches. This means foes such as Mega Mewtwo Y after using Psycho Boost and other offensive foes that cannot inflict serious damage to Regigigas are setup fodder. Once Regigigas has safely activated Toxic Orb, it can proceed to set up Shift Gear to threaten the opposing team or hinder walls with Knock Off should a foe with Safety Goggles switch in. Should Regigigas be facing more defensive teams, it is more beneficial to analyze how an opponent reacts to Regigigas. In this regard, using Knock Off early-game to remove items is a sensible strategy, as this will aid Regigigas's attempts to break past or take away momentum from Fur Coat users or most non-Magic Bounce foes later on. When setting up with Regigigas, scout for possible Core Enforcer and Entrainment users, as they can suppress Poison Heal and thus easily force out Regigigas. When Regigigas finds itself unable to set up against well-prepared teams, it can still support its team by putting foes to sleep or by double switching out to a teammate after luring in Magic Bounce users. When Regigigas is low on health, slow pivoting provides it with passive recovery, so take advantage of this when one is able to secure momentum. A few turns of Poison Heal recovery will bring Regigigas back to a healthy enough state so that it can take on defensive foes again. Once its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened or eliminated, Regigigas can liberally switch into a passive foe, set up and proceed to overpower the opposing team with its overwhelmingly powerful Facade. Avalanche should be used against potential Core Enforcer users like Giratina to prevent the move from suppressing Poison Heal. Lastly, in an instance where Regigigas opted for Spectral Thief, it can offensively check setup sweepers that fail to OHKO Regigigas by stealing their boosts.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Regigigas is hopelessly shut down by Giratina, so its best partners are Pixilate and Refrigerate users. Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem-W can fit alongsides Regigigas in this regard, as they appreciate Regigigas overwhelming Steel-types by putting them to sleep or by removing important items like Assault Vest with Knock Off. -ate Pokemon also tend to pressure Magic Bounce users a lot, meaning they can take advantage of forced switches by setting entry hazards or pivoting out to Regigigas for a safe activation of Toxic Orb. Entry hazard support is generally appreciated, as Regigigas tends to force many switches and can't fit a move that is dedicated to defeating Sturdy Shedinja. Fairy-types like Mega Diancie, Xerneas, and Mega Audino can switch into Core Enforcer, as both Mega Diancie and Xerneas offensively force out Giratina, while Mega Audino can take momentum away from it. As a result, the presence of these Fairy-types can somewhat improve Regigigas's matchup against Giratina by making it more wary about using Core Enforcer in an attempt to check Regigigas. Stealth Rock also helps Regigigas meet important benchmarks, letting it OHKO Mega Blaziken and Mega Mewtwo X with +1 Facade after Stealth Rock, both of which would otherwise offensively check Regigigas. Strong Knock Off users such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar can help Regigigas generate setup opportunities should it lack the move itself and pressure Ghost-types like Giratina and Aegislash. The mentioned Dark-type teammates can run more offensive sets with Choice Band to heavily weaken or eliminate Giratina. Regigigas, while it is bulky, tends to be vulnerable to being revenge killed by -ate users when weakened and is easily dented by strong neutral attacks from faster attackers. Steel-types can guard Regigigas from -ate users until they have been sufficiently weakened or until Regigigas is given an opportunity to set up and outspeed them. RegenVest walls can handle faster threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y and -ate users depending on their typing while letting Regigigas utilize the momentum they secure via slow pivoting.</p>"

  "Giratina": {
    "overview": "<p>Colossal natural bulk of 150 / 120 / 120 and a good defensive typing of Dragon / Ghost combined with its ability to further improve its defensive capabilities make Giratina one of the best walls in Balanced Hackmons. It can easily secure its places on many teams by opting for abilities such as Poison Heal, Comatose, Fur Coat, Magic Bounce, and Regenerator, some of which let Giratina mitigate some of its would-be drawbacks. In addition, Giratina's useful immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type attacks lets it function as one of the strongest checks to many dangerous threats, such as Poison Heal Regigigas and Sturdy Shedinja. Access to STAB Core Enforcer and Spectral Thief, with the ability to equip Griseous Orb, reduces Giratina's passivity against offensive teams. However, -ate abilities are bad news for Giratina, especially with the prevalence of Mega Diancie. Dark-, Fairy-, and Ice-type moves like Knock Off, Pursuit, and Pixilate- and Refrigerate-boosted attacks are also fairly common and can somewhat limit Giratina's defensive capabilities. In addition, while Giratina excels defensively, it faces competition with Zygarde-C, which is marginally bulkier and has a lower base Speed to pivot against other walls to secure momentum. Giratina also tends to struggle to deal significant damage and gives away momentum against very common defensive Pokemon such as Registeel and Mega Audino due to its somewhat high Speed that prevents Giratina from effectively pivoting against them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Giratina can use Mold Breaker in tandem with Pursuit to trap Sturdy Shedinja and bypass Magic Bounce users. Mold Breaker sets can also more reliably run various entry hazards like Spikes or Toxic Spikes against Magic Bounce users, which Giratina can't do much against otherwise. Misty Surge is another viable choice of ability that prevents status ailments and can be handy in defensive teams. With Misty Terrain support, Giratina and its teammates can choose to hold other items like Leftovers instead of Safety Goggles and hinder opposing Poison Heal users' longevity by preventing Toxic Orb and therefore Poison Heal from getting activated. Prankster and Unaware allow Giratina to better handle setup sweepers, but there are better Prankster users to consider, and Giratina's weakness to Moongeist Beam makes Unaware somewhat of a questionable option. Purify might be an interesting option, but Giratina's horrendous matchup against Poison Heal users apart from Regigigas leaves other walls like Primal Kyogre a better user of it. Knock Off rids other walls of their items, most notably Eviolite from Chansey, but Dark-types such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Yveltal are better users. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze setup sweepers and rack up damage on foes. Wish allows Giratina to transfer a massive amount of healing to one of its teammates thanks to its great HP stat. Assault Vest and Regenerator can surprise some mixed setup sweepers such as Mega Mewtwo X and Primal Groudon, but this forgoes Giratina's ability to reliably handle Regigigas, and the increase in bulk from Assault Vest doesn't help Giratina's matchup against -ate users in any significant way.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pixilate and Refrigerate Users</strong>: Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem-W are the greatest threats to Giratina. All of them can heavily dent or KO Giratina with their super effective Boomburst. Mega Diancie in particular can easily switch into Core Enforcer, but Kyurem-B and Kyurem-W must face Giratina with caution.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Audino, especially the Magic Bounce variant, completely shuts Giratina down and leaves it with almost nothing to do, and its immunity to Core Enforcer and Spectral Thief leaves Giratina with no way to ever do meaningfully damage it. Poison Heal Xerneas can easily set up on Giratina without much fear.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar not only hits Giratina super effectively with Spooky Plate-boosted Judgment but can also use Entrainment with Normalize to neutralize Giratina's attacks and freely set up on it. It is important to note, however, that Mega Gengar cannot OHKO Giratina from full HP, and therefore it might be harshly punished if it mindlessly sets up and fails to anticipate Spectral Thief. Normalize sets also have to use Entrainment with caution if Giratina has Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y</strong>: Although they do not appreciate switching into Spectral Thief or U-turn, both Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y can overwhelm Giratina with sheer power. Mega Mewtwo X can use Choice Band-boosted Ice Hammer or Photon Geyser in tandem with Adaptability to easily 2HKO Giratina. Meanwhile, Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y sets can 2HKO Giratina with the appropriate moves and plain Choice Specs Mega Mewtwo Y can 2HKO Giratina with Photon Geyser after Stealth Rock damage without factoring in any boosting ability.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Although none of them appreciate switching into Core Enforcer, Mega Garchomp, Zekrom, and Mega Sceptile can hit Giratina super effectively with their STAB Dragon-type attacks. Zygarde-C, while it lacks enough offensive presence to pose a serious threat to Giratina, is slower than Giratina and can suppress Giratina's ability with Core Enforcer and pivot more slowly.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers like Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Shell Smash Zekrom can OHKO Giratina with their sheer power after gaining boosts.</p> <p><strong>Slower Walls</strong>: Although they can't do much back to Giratina, slower walls such as Registeel, Fur Coat Chansey, and other walls can pivot slower than Giratina does and take away its momentum. None of them appreciate burns from Scald or Toxic status from Poison Fang in the long run, however.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: With the exception of Poison Heal variants, Giratina will sustain considerable amount of damage from common moves like Core Enforcer, Spectral Thief, and Knock Off. Giratina's weakness to Moongeist Beam also limits its ability to check setup sweepers as well.</p>",

      "Defensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Core Enforcer serves as Giratina's primary STAB move and provides the utility of nullifying abilities from foes that are reliant on their ability to function, such as Poison Heal users like Regigigas, RegenVest users, and -ate users, while doing decent damage to neutral foes and preventing threats like Mega Garchomp from freely switching in. Shore Up makes sure Giratina stays healthy to consistently switch into threats it is tasked to handle. U-turn allows Giratina to pivot as a wall and safely bring in its teammates, letting it switch out from unfavorable matchups and generate momentum. Spectral Thief lets Giratina harshly punish threats that try to set up on it and also efficiently threatens both Mega formes of Mewtwo, as they are 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage if Giratina is equipped with Griseous Orb. Stealth Rock or other entry hazards can also be used in the last slot thanks to Giratina's durability and immunity to Rapid Spin. In the same vein, Giratina can take advantage of its bulk to consistently remove entry hazards from the field using Defog.</p> <p>Giratina can employ various other moves to improve its matchup against Magic Bounce users. It can opt to run an entry hazard move and Poison Fang to punish Magic Bounce Audino by significantly hindering its longevity and generally support its teammates by spreading status. Poison Fang also notably lets Giratina defeat Sturdy Shedinja without relying on its teammates. Giratina can also run Skill Swap alongside an entry hazard move to directly set hazards against Magic Bounce users if it opts for Fur Coat. Will-O-Wisp can be used to burn offensive foes like Mega Mewtwo X while also letting Giratina independently deal with Shedinja.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Giratina's Speed stat is minimized in order for it to be slower than as many walls as possible so that it can safely bring in a teammate. 16 Speed EVs can be invested in Speed with 31 Speed IVs in order to outspeed up to base 150 Speed Pokemon after stealing a Shell Smash boost so that Giratina can KO them next turn without getting hit first. More Speed EVs can be used so Giratina can outspeed and 2HKO opposing Giratina with Griseous Orb-boosted Core Enforcer. A Relaxed nature allows Giratina to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X's Photon Geyser and Knock Off from Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage, if holding Griseous Orb. A Relaxed nature also maximizes Giratina's bulk, improving its matchup against foes like Regigigas. Magic Bounce gives Giratina a pseudo-immunity to status by reflecting certain status moves, but it does not protect Giratina from status that is induced from attacks such as Poison Fang, Sacred Fire, and Nuzzle. Giratina can also use Comatose to prevent it from being afflicted by status moves and to prevent Normalize Gengar from giving it Normalize. Unlike Magic Bounce, Giratina with Comatose is less hindered by Core Enforcer and Entrainment. Both mentioned abilities allow Giratina to effectively check Regigigas as they provide Giratina with an immunity to sleep-inducing moves. Fur Coat, on the other hand, makes Giratina nigh impossible to penetrate with physical attacks and boosts Giratina's bulk to the point where it can check boosted Poison Heal Regigigas even despite its vulnerability to sleep-inducing moves. For an item, Griseous Orb is one of the best options for Giratina, as it reduces the damage it takes from Knock Off and increases damage output of Core Enforcer and Spectral Thief, reducing Giratina's overall passivity. Leftovers is useful for passive recovery, while Darkinium Z also reduces the damage Giratina takes from Knock Off and allows Giratina to use Z-Parting Shot, which can fully restore the health of one of its teammates. Darkinium Z should only be used alongside Parting Shot to see a viable use. Safety Goggles, on the other hand, provides Fur Coat Giratina with an immunity to Spore.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Giratina can be switched into most physical attackers, such as Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X. Especially if it has Magic Bounce, switching into the likes of Solgaleo, Registeel, and other walls that can't threaten it is a promising idea to scout whether they carry status moves or entry hazards. Thanks to its immense bulk, Giratina can even switch into foes with typing advantage such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar to absorb Knock Off if it is holding irremovable items and once such foes are revealed to be defensive sets. Although it might be tempting to immediately set up entry hazards or use status moves once Giratina is given a switch, it is better to see how opponents react so that one can be aware of potential Magic Bounce users switching in. Scouting foes like Registeel and Mega Audino is a more sensible plan in this regard. When dealing with physical attackers that are unable to threaten Giratina in any significant way, Core Enforcer can be used to punish them by removing their abilities. Especially against the likes of Mega Mewtwo X and Primal Groudon, which would rely on boosts to have a chance of surmounting Giratina, Spectral Thief can be used to ensure Giratina won't be overwhelmed by boosted attacks next turn. It is usually best for Giratina to switch out of dangerous matchups, but it can risk the KO and stay in to deter setup with Spectral Thief if preventing setup is more important. When it seems the opponent is likely going to set up while forcing Giratina out with threats like Mega Gengar or Mega Mewtwo Y and if Giratina's teammates do not have much of a way to deal with them aside from revenge killing, one can recklessly use Spectral Thief to prevent an opposing sweep, although this can be very dangerous, especially against the former. If Giratina does not have much do to and it is predicted that a Magic Bounce user or a Steel-type will switch in to deflect entry hazard moves or take a Core Enforcer, it can pivot out using U-turn or Parting Shot. When using Z-Parting Shot, be very wary of opposing Magic Bounce users, as they can make an attempt to fully restore a teammate's HP go to a waste by simply switching in at the right moment.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types are great partners for Giratina, as it is vulnerable to -ate users. Registeel and Celesteela are good defensive Pokemon that resist a majority of the attacks from the likes of Mega Beedrill and Mega Diancie. Giratina can switch into Fire- and Fighting-type attacks for Steel-types in return while blocking Rapid Spin to keep entry hazards up. Steel-types also check Mega Mewtwo Y, one of the wallbreakers that are capable of overpowering Giratina. Fur Coat variants of Giratina can even switch into Knock Off if its partner Steel-types do not enjoy losing crucial items like Assault Vest or Leftovers. Primal Groudon checks Primal Kyogre and Xerneas, both of which Giratina has a hard time wearing down, and threatens out Steel-types and Mega Diancie that may try taking advantage of Giratina. Primal Groudon can also switch into Kartana, one of the very few physical attackers that can overwhelm Giratina. Likewise, Mega Audino is a great partner that can switch into Core Enforcer and Spectral Thief for Giratina and easily Imposter-proofs it, as it is immune to both Core Enforcer and Spectral Thief. It also checks Normalize Mega Gengar if it is running a Magic Bounce set. Other Fairy-types like Mega Diancie and Xerneas can prevent Imposter users from switching into Giratina and freely using recovery moves by forcing them out and taking momentum if they do. Fur Coat Chansey has great defensive synergy with Giratina, as they not only cover each other's type weaknesses but also wall each other's checks. Giratina can handle overwhelming physical attackers such as Regigigas and Primal Groudon while Chansey walls most special attackers and also can switch into Core Enforcer easily thanks to its phenomenal special bulk. Giratina with an irremovable item can also switch into most Knock Off users with impunity, and Magic Bounce variants can prevent entry hazards or status moves from foes that attempt to take advantage of Chansey. In general, Giratina appreciates a bulky teammate that has some way to deal with Magic Bounce users because its matchup against Magic Bounce users is not too great. Poison Fang users can put problematic foes like Mega Audino on a timer, while Knock Off users, primarily Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Yveltal, hinder walls by removing their items while serving as good switch-ins to Mega Mewtwo Y. Offensive teammates like Mega Mewtwo X and Primal Groudon appreciate Giratina's defensive presence and slow pivoting, and in return they can destroy Steel-types and overpower problematic foes like Mega Audino for Giratina.</p>"

      "Poison Heal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Core Enforcer is mandatory in order for Giratina to check Regigigas and prevent offensive threats from easily switching into it. It also prevents RegenVest and -ate users from freely taking advantage of it. A recovery move is still needed even with access to passive recovery from Poison Heal, as recovery from Poison Heal alone is not sufficient, and Shore Up significantly improves Giratina's longevity. The third moveslot can be flexible depending on what role Giratina should perform. Will-O-Wisp can be used to more reliably spread burns and weaken physical attackers, but it can't burn Magic Bounce users. Scald cripples physical attackers similarly and punishes Imposter Chansey if it switches into Giratina and attempts to take advantage of its support moves. Scald's ability to burn Magic Bounce users helps Giratina outlast foes like Magic Bounce Mega Audino in the long run thanks to Scald's residual damage and Giratina's Poison Heal. Spectral Thief lets Giratina shut down setup sweepers and steal their boosts. Thanks to its immunity to sleep, Giratina can take on boosting Poison Heal users that use sleep-inducing moves such as Regigigas, Primal Kyogre, and even Xerneas. The move is also handy for hitting Mega Mewtwo formes and Aegislash super effectively. Poison Heal Giratina can also provide Defog support for its team thanks to its increased longevity. Spiky Shield, on the other hand, allows Giratina to safely activate Toxic Orb, gain an extra turn of recovery from Poison Heal that can sometimes turn 2HKOs into 3HKOs, check Shedinja lacking Protective Pads, and scout moves from Choice item users. Spiky Shield can also slightly damage slower foes that attempt to pivot slowly and take momentum away from Giratina, and an extra turn of recovery can sometimes turn 2HKOs into 3HKOs. Finally, U-turn allows Giratina to pivot and safely bring in a teammate. Giratina can also use Night Shade instead to consistently damage foes for sizeable damage, reducing its passivity slightly.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A minimized Speed stat allows Giratina to pivot against other base 90 Speed Pokemon, allowing it to move last and let its teammates switch in unharmed, while Toxic Orb and Poison Heal allow Giratina to take advantage of poison status to gain passive recovery at the end of each turn so it can take on other Poison Heal users like Regigigas that tend to combat bulky Pokemon with sleep-inducing moves. Being slower than other potential Core Enforcer users also helps Giratina avoid its Poison Heal from being suppressed. A Relaxed nature lets Giratina easily absorb Knock Off especially after Toxic Orb has been removed, while a Sassy nature can be used to always survive +2 Fleur Cannon from Primal Groudon at full health while still avoiding 2HKOs from various physical attackers thanks to recovery from Poison Heal.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unlike other sets, Poison Heal Giratina has an easier time switching into various threats thanks to passive recovery from Poison Heal. In order to utilize this, Giratina must activate its Toxic Orb by any means necessary. For example, it can be safely brought in by teammates' slow pivoting moves or it can use Spiky Shield to guard itself from status moves and Knock Off; this can be risky, however, as a foe can set up or set entry hazards while Giratina protects itself. Core Enforcer is the most commonly used move, but do not use it mindlessly, as Giratina tends to draw in Fairy-types, and losing momentum against them isn't ideal. While Giratina is a great Knock Off absorber with Poison Heal, ensure that its Toxic Orb is removed by weaker attackers, as Knock Off from Pokemon like Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar, especially if boosted, can potentially KO Giratina. Be cautious against Pokemon with Core Enforcer, Pokemon with Entrainment like Mega Gengar, Magic Bounce users, and other bulky foes like Primal Kyogre as they can remove Poison Heal from Giratina and thus force it out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Similarly to other Giratina sets, Poison Heal Giratina appreciates Steel-type partners that can switch into -ate users and Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-type attacks. Bulky Pokemon like Assault Vest users, passive foes with Safety Goggles, and Fur Coat Chansey appreciate Giratina's ability to consistently switch into status moves and weak Knock Offs. Specially defensive partners like Primal Kyogre and Chansey also appreciate the burns that Giratina induces so that they have room to breathe against physical attackers. Poison Heal Giratina in general has passive recovery to heal off chip damage and an immunity to other status, making it a great counter to Sturdy Shedinja and a great fit in many balanced and defensive teams.</p>"

  "Audino-Mega": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Audino's solid mixed bulk and fantastic typing with key immunities to Dragon and Ghost and a resistance to Bug allow it to be one of the best switch-ins to defensive Pokemon. This is amplified by immunities and resistances to common utility moves such as Spectral Thief, Core Enforcer, U-turn, and Knock Off, along with a low base 50 Speed that lets it underspeed most of the other defensive pivots such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Primal Kyogre. Its immunity to Core Enforcer also allows it to run Magic Bounce and Poison Heal very effectively without having them removed. Defensively, its typing also offers an immunity to powerful moves like Draco Meteor and Moongeist Beam and a resistance to boosted Power Trip. This allows it to run Unaware to check some setup sweepers that rely on Moongeist Beam or Power Trip to break Unaware. Its solid mixed bulk along with a neutrality to common coverage and STAB moves from -ate Pokemon also makes a Soundproof set viable. Unfortunately, Mega Audino’s typing leaves it weak to Steel- and Poison-type moves, including common coverage moves such as Sunsteel Strike and Anchor Shot, which combined with its passivity allows dangerous attackers such as Kartana, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Gengar to switch in safely. In addition, its typing doesn’t offer too many resistances and it also doesn't have spectacular bulk to offset this, meaning it doesn't provide much defensive utility against strong wallbreakers such as Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y, Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X, and Primal Groudon and the team might not be able to cover some offensive threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Unaware set with Shore Up, Spectral Thief, U-turn, and Core Enforcer is possible to check dangerous setup sweepers such as Triage Yveltal. However, due to its weakness to Sunsteel Strike it cannot effectively check physical setup attackers and also loses out on the status protection Magic Bounce and Poison Heal provide. Other setup Pokemon can also overwhelm it through strong neutral STAB attacks like Primal Kyogre's Water Spout. A Soundproof set with Shore Up, Parting Shot, Anchor Shot, and Core Enforcer is a decent check to -ate users, being able to handle Pokemon like Choice Specs Refrigerate Kyurem-B and Pixilate Mega Diancie. However, it can be worn down into -ate Extreme Speed range, and Mega Audino also doesn't like losing status protection. A Fur Coat set can check some dangerous physical attackers like Mega Garchomp. However, it is much less useful than the other sets, and Sunsteel Strike still threatens Mega Audino through Fur Coat. In addition, Mega Garchomp is uncommon, which means Mega Audino would rather have another ability the majority of the time. Prankster is another possible ability to act as a setup check while retaining Mega Audino's ability to gain momentum from Pokemon like Giratina. Most other Pokemon like Registeel and Giratina perform the job better though, with their better typing, as Mega Audino is weak to Sunsteel Strike, a common move used on setup Pokemon. Mega Audino will also be very passive with U-turn as its only damaging move. Spikes can be used over Stealth Rock to pressure the opposing team more with entry hazards, but Mega Audino prefers reliable Rapid Spin support to avoid clearing entry hazards on the opponent's side. It can also be annoying when a trapped Imposter lays them down. Purify is an option over Defog on the Magic Bounce set to defeat Poison Heal users in tandem with Knock Off. However, this comes at a cost of requiring another hazard remover and removing some Pokemon such as Poison Heal users as possible ways to Imposter-proof Mega Audino. Scald is an interesting option on the Poison Heal set as a way to burn opposing Pokemon that cannot be blocked by Magic Bounce, unlike Will-O-Wisp. However, outside of that it is much more unreliable than Will-O-Wisp with its 30% burn chance, which can be important in situations against physical attackers than can 2HKO Mega Audino. A combination of Substitute + Baton Pass can be used on the Poison Heal set to aid offensive teammates in setting up or firing strong attacks. However, Mega Audino will lose a lot of the utility provided by other moves, and Imposter Pokemon can take advantage of Substitute itself if Shore Up is chosen over Spiky Shield.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Steel-types</strong>: Mega Audino is weak to Steel, and its passivity leaves it open to powerful Steel-types like Kartana, Necrozma-DM, and offensive Dialga firing off strong attacks or setting up.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar threatens Mega Audino with STAB Poison-type moves. It must be careful of Knock Off though, as all Mega Gengar sets hate losing their item, whether it is Spooky Plate, Choice Scarf, or Choice Specs. Normalize Mega Gengar is also checked by the Magic Bounce set.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Mega Audino doesn't resist a lot of common offensive typings and doesn't have exceptional bulk, so strong wallbreakers like Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Mewtwo X, and Primal Groudon can break through it. Primal Groudon also doesn't fear any of Mega Audino's moves thanks to its high bulk, immunity to burns, and reduced damage from Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Setup Pokemon</strong>: Mega Audino tends to be passive, which allows Pokemon to set up on and overwhelm it. Shell Smash users can easily set up if Mega Audino isn't carrying Spectral Thief and threaten it immediately after a boost. Some setup Pokemon also carry Sunsteel Strike, which can heavily damage Mega Audino.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Mega Audino needs to be at high health to reliably check the Pokemon it needs to check, and entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes chip it down.</p> <p><strong>Imposter Users</strong>: While Imposter users usually cannot hard switch into Mega Audino due to the threat of trapping, sets that do not self-Imposter-proof are very vulnerable to Imposter users switching in to freely recover and PP stall.</p> <p><strong>Poison Fang</strong>: Poison Fang can threaten all Mega Audino sets except for Poison Heal with Toxic status, chipping it down throughout the course of the game. This is especially problematic on the Magic Bounce set as it commonly switches into defensive Pokemon such as Giratina and Zygarde-C.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Magic Bounce": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shore Up keeps Mega Audino healthy, and can get a boost to its recovery because Mega Audino is a solid switch-in to the most common Sand Stream user, Mega Tyranitar. U-turn allows Mega Audino to pivot, and with its low base 50 Speed it is able to underspeed most Pokemon and bring in a teammate safely. Alternatively, Anchor Shot allows Mega Audino to trap Imposter Pokemon and PP stall them. However, having to forgo U-turn means Mega Audino can lose momentum in situations and can no longer provide slow pivoting. Volt Switch is on option over U-turn to allow Mega Audino to be Imposter-proofed by Ground-types with trapping moves such as Primal Groudon and Zygarde-C. It also bypasses Rocky Helmet, Baneful Bunker, and Spiky Shield. Knock Off can remove defensive items like Leftovers, Rocky Helmet, and Safety Goggles, annoy offensive Pokemon by removing their boosting item, and scout for Z-Crystals. It can also notably remove Mega Gengar's Spooky Plate, letting Mega Audino act as a great check to it thanks to Magic Bounce and its immunity to Ghost-type moves. Knock Off also deters Imposter Chansey from switching in freely by threatening to remove its Eviolite. Entrainment notably allows Mega Audino to defeat Poison Heal Xerneas thanks to its solid Special Defense and immunity to Lovely Kiss, especially combined with Anchor Shot to trap and remove it, and deters other Poison Heal Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre and Regigigas from switching in. However, note that Xerneas can overwhelm Mega Audino with enough Quiver Dance boosts, so running Spectral Thief or Topsy-Turvy is recommended. Defog is a good choice for teams that lack entry hazard removal, as Magic Bounce will prevent hazards from being set again after Mega Audino uses Defog. Spectral Thief is an option to deter setup and allows Mega Audino to take on Poison Heal Xerneas better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A negative Speed nature and minimum Speed IVs allow Mega Audino to underspeed most defensive Pokemon to provide a slow pivot and gain momentum. Sassy nature lets Mega Audino take special attacks like Primal Kyogre's Revelation Dance, Normalize Mega Gengar’s Boomburst, and Poison Heal Xerneas's Moonblast better. Leftovers allows Mega Audino to mitigate chip damage. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves, including the omnipresent U-turn, and also can KO Sturdy Shedinja after its Protective Pads has been removed. Lagging Tail is an option to guarantee underspeeding Imposter Pokemon and other base 50 Speed Pokemon like Registeel and Chansey. Magic Bounce makes Mega Audino a reliable switch-in to both defensive and offensive Pokemon that rely on status moves such as Poison Heal Mega Mewtwo X, Giratina, and Zygarde-C.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Audino is capable of safely switching in against most defensive Pokemon thanks to its typing and Magic Bounce being able to completely wall foes like Giratina, Zygarde-C, Registeel, and Yveltal. In tandem with its low Speed, this makes Mega Audino an excellent pivot, and U-turn is generally a safe move to click. However, some defensive Pokemon run Poison Fang, which can cripple Mega Audino, so scout for it before liberally switching in. Scouting for offensive Pokemon that Mega Audino can check is important, as many Pokemon can heavily damage if not outright KO Mega Audino if they are running a different set. These include Mega Gengar, which can bluff Normalize with Adaptability, and Dark-types, which can bluff defensive sets with offensive sets carrying Sunsteel Strike. Mega Audino also needs to be careful if the opposing Pokemon's team has a wallbreaker such as Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X or Kartana that can threaten it, as the opposing Pokemon can double switch out or pivot with U-turn. Mega Audino can also safely switch into some offensive Pokemon such as Poison Heal Mega Mewtwo X, Normalize Mega Gengar, and Poison Heal Xerneas if it carries Entrainment. Don’t attempt to stay in against powerful attackers such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Diancie, as while Mega Audino can potentially take a hit, proper checks such as Registeel are much better answers. However, if the opponent has a Pokemon that Mega Audino can recover for free on, staying in to use Knock Off or U-turn is a plausible option to remove their item or scout for the set. Keep entry hazards off the field, since Mega Audino is susceptible to all forms of them, especially Toxic Spikes. It also requires being healthy to check some offensive Pokemon such as Poison Heal Xerneas, and hazards can wear it down into KO range. While Mega Audino can prevent hazards from some Pokemon such as Giratina and Poison Heal Mega Mewtwo X, other setters like Primal Groudon and Mega Diancie can force Mega Audino out. Knock Off is very spammable, because in general the opposing Pokemon will eventually want to pivot out, and thanks to Mega Audino's low Speed they will most likely fail to pivot after the Knock Off, allowing you to remove the switch-in's item. This is especially effective on Pokemon like Primal Kyogre and Aegislash that will always outspeed Mega Audino. If combined with Lagging Tail, Mega Audino will always go after the opposing Pokemon, guaranteeing the removal of the switch-in's item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel type Pokemon such as Registeel, Celesteela, and Aegislash are good partners because they can take on many strong wallbreakers that can pressure Mega Audino such as Mega Mewtwo Y and -ate users such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-W. They can also take on the Poison- and Steel-type moves that threaten Mega Audino super effectively. Flash Fire Celesteela can also check Primal Groudon, while Aegislash can check Mega Mewtwo X. Bulky physical walls such as Mega Slowbro and Prankster Giratina can answer Mega Mewtwo X, Kartana, and Necrozma-DM, all of which easily force Mega Audino out. Mega Audino is weak to Mega Gengar's Poison-type STAB attacks, so specially bulky Pokemon like RegenVest Yveltal and Primal Kyogre are useful to switch in against it. Mega Audino can give opportunities for opposing Pokemon to set up, so answers to setup sweepers are needed; examples include Unaware and Prankster Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre, Zygarde-C, and Giratina. Pokemon utilizing -ate abilities like Mega Diancie can also revenge kill opponent setup sweepers. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar appreciate Mega Audino's slow pivoting and ability to sponge common utility moves like Spectral Thief, Knock Off, and U-turn from defensive Pokemon. Imposter users can scout for opposing movesets and determine if Mega Audino can safely switch in. For example, Mega Audino is a solid switch-in to defensive variants of Mega Tyranitar, but Shell Smash variants can KO it with a boosted Sunsteel Strike. Poison Fang is another move that Imposter can scout for to prevent Mega Audino from being badly poisoned. Imposter Chansey can also switch into the dangerous attackers that Mega Audino struggles to deal with. In return, Mega Audino can bring Chansey in with a slow pivot to safely scout opposing Pokemon without fearing trapping moves. Entry hazard setters such as Giratina and Poison Heal Mega Mewtwo X can pressure the opposing team and can be Imposter-proofed by Mega Audino. If Mega Audino isn't running Anchor Shot, a way to Imposter-proof it is needed. This can be Poison Heal attackers like Regigigas and Xerneas if Mega Audino doesn't have Entrainment, setup sweepers, and Shedinja. Shedinja in particular can tank all sorts of strong attacks for Mega Audino and appreciates Mega Audino's reliable Magic Bounce support. Mega Audino fails to threaten Sturdy Shedinja at all, which allows Shedinja to come in easily. As a result, Ghost-type Pokemon such as Giratina and Aegislash that can check Shedinja are needed.</p>"

      "Poison Heal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shore Up keeps Mega Audino healthy, and can get an extra recovery boost because Mega Audino is a solid switch-in to the most common Sand Stream user, Mega Tyranitar. Spiky Shield allows Mega Audino to safely activate its Toxic Orb, as well as scout moves from Pokemon with Choice items and Z-Moves and safely gain another round of Poison Heal recovery. While it cannot recover health as quickly as Shore Up, it denies Imposter users any recovery at all. Spiky Shield also prevents Sturdy Shedinja from being able to KO Mega Audino. Spiky Shield is chosen over Baneful Bunker to prevent opposing Imposter to get poisoned, while King's Shield doesn't allow a safe Toxic Orb activation due to its inability to prevent status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Trick. U-turn allows Mega Audino to pivot, and thanks to its low base 50 Speed it is able to underspeed most opposing Pokemon and bring in a teammate safely. U-turn has synergy with Spiky Shield to allow Mega Audino to pivot while being Imposter-proof. Spectral Thief deters setup and allows Mega Audino to check Poison Heal Xerneas. Knock Off can remove helpful defensive items like Leftovers, Rocky Helmet, Eviolite, and Safety Goggles, annoy offensive Pokemon, and scout for Z-Crystals. Core Enforcer is an option to suppress the opposing Pokemon’s ability thanks to Mega Audino’s low Speed, and it won't affect Mega Audino's Poison Heal when used by its Imposter thanks to its Fairy typing. However, it is unable to threaten Poison Heal Xerneas. Defog is a good choice for teams that lack entry hazard removal, as Poison Heal can mitigate some chip damage and Mega Audino has a good matchup against many setters like Giratina and Poison Heal Mega Mewtwo X. Stealth Rock is a solid option on Mega Audino thanks to its good matchup against most defensive Magic Bounce users such as Giratina. Will-O-Wisp allows Mega Audino to cripple otherwise dangerous physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X and Kartana while chipping defensive Pokemon like Registeel and Primal Kyogre. In addition, Mega Audino can burn its Imposter, helping physical wallbreakers on its team. Purify is an option to be used with Knock Off to check Poison Heal Pokemon by removing their Toxic Orb and curing their poison status. However, this does come at the cost of a utility move and requiring another Pokemon to Imposter-proof Mega Audino.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A negative Speed nature and minimum Speed IVs allow Mega Audino to underspeed most defensive Pokemon to provide a slow pivot and gain momentum. A Relaxed nature lets Mega Audino always avoid the 2HKO from unboosted Poison Heal Regigigas's Facade while taking Anchor Shots from defensive Pokemon like Registeel better. On the other hand, a Sassy nature lets Mega Audino take special moves like Primal Kyogre's Revelation Dance and Poison Heal Xerneas's Moonblast better. Sassy also allows Mega Audino to stay in on -ate users better if required. A Toxic Orb in conjunction with Poison Heal gives Mega Audino status protection, sizable passive healing, and the ability to absorb Knock Off after Toxic Orb has been activated. This allows Mega Audino to counter some offensive Poison Heal Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo X, Primal Kyogre, and Xerneas and switch into defensive Pokemon better, with Poison Heal negating chip damage. In addition, Mega Audino's Fairy typing gives it an immunity to Core Enforcer, which normally forces out other Poison Heal Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Audino can safely switch in against most defensive Pokemon such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Registeel thanks to its typing providing immunities and resistances against common utility moves and Poison Heal providing it with a status immunity and passive healing against chip damage. It can also safely switch into some offensive Pokemon such as Poison Heal Mega Mewtwo X, Xerneas, and Primal Kyogre. Due to its low Speed and ability to completely wall Pokemon such as Giratina, Yveltal, and the aforementioned offensive Poison Heal users, Mega Audino is an excellent pivot, and U-turn is generally a safe move to click to gain momentum. If the opposing Pokemon stays in, Mega Audino can easily switch back in and recover chip damage with Poison Heal. After Toxic Orb activation, Mega Audino is also a fantastic Knock Off absorber. If Mega Audino is carrying Stealth Rock, it can force in the opposing Magic Bounce Pokemon on it, which can be easily exploited by teammates that can pressure it effectively. It also allows Mega Audino to force out opposing Pokemon that it usually cannot threaten. Don’t attempt to stay in against powerful attackers such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Diancie, as Mega Audino doesn’t have the defensive typing or exceptional bulk to take them on. If necessary, however, Mega Audino can avoid the OHKO from many attacks and pivot out to let in a teammate safely, as Poison Heal can allow it to recover the health quickly later on. This is risky, and should only be done if the defensive answer cannot safely switch in or the team lacks a safe switch-in. In addition, against Pokemon that have super effective STAB attacks, such as Kartana and non-Normalize Mega Gengar, Mega Audino risks getting OHKOed. Furthermore, Mega Audino can no longer reliably answer many Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Poison Heal users until it is healthy enough. If Mega Audino is carrying Spiky Shield, leading with it and using Spiky Shield can guarantee a safe Toxic Orb activation. However, this could allow the opposing Pokemon to set up or activate its own Toxic Orb, so it should only be used if there are no Pokemon on the opposing team that can effectively threaten your team. Later on in the game, Spiky Shield can also scout for attacks from unknown movesets or Choice-locked Pokemon such as Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X. Mega Audino should also be played more aggressively with Spiky Shield and pivot frequently, since it lacks the immediate healing. Knock Off is a fairly spammable move, since most defensive Pokemon cannot threaten Mega Audino effectively, and with Mega Audino's low Speed preventing most opposing Pokemon from slowly pivoting out, Mega Audino can threaten to remove the switch-in's item. Thanks to the status immunity, it can switch into most RegenVest users, even if they carry Poison Fang, and threaten to remove their Assault Vest. If it carries Spiky Shield, it can even stay in on Sturdy Shedinja to remove its Protective Pads.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-type Pokemon like Registeel, Aegislash, and Celesteela are good partners because they can take on many strong wallbreakers such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Pixilate Mega Diancie, and Refrigerate Kyurem-W that can pressure Mega Audino. Flash Fire Celesteela can blanket check -ate users and Primal Groudon and isn't vulnerable to Spikes compared to other Steel-types, which allows Mega Audino to run a Relaxed nature, as it no longer needs to cover -ate users for the Steel-type Pokemon. Other Flash Fire Steel-type Pokemon can also check -ate users and other wallbreaker Pokemon. They also appreciate Mega Audino's ability to take a hit to scout the set if needed. Bulky physical walls such as Mega Slowbro and Prankster Giratina can answer Mega Mewtwo X, Kartana, and Primal Groudon, all of which easily force Mega Audino out. In return, Mega Audino provides status absorption and a slow pivot to gain momentum. Mega Audino is weak to Mega Gengar, so specially bulky Pokemon like RegenVest Yveltal, Dialga, and Primal Kyogre are useful to switch in against it. In return, Mega Audino acts as a good Knock Off absorber that could remove their Assault Vests. Mega Audino can give opportunities for opposing Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Kartana to set up, so answers to setup sweepers are needed; examples include Unaware and Prankster Pokemon such as Zygarde-C, Giratina, Registeel, and Primal Kyogre. Other slow pivots like Registeel and Mega Slowbro can let Mega Audino in safely to activate its Toxic Orb should it not carry Spiky Shield. Strong but frail wallbreakers like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar appreciate Mega Audino's ability to switch into checks such as Yveltal and Primal Kyogre and gain momentum. Imposter users can scout for opposing movesets and determine if Mega Audino can safely switch in. Imposter Chansey can also switch in to the dangerous attackers that Mega Audino struggles to deal with. In return, Mega Audino can bring Chansey in with U-turn to safely scout opposing Pokemon without fearing trapping moves as well as providing status absorption and a switch-in against Imposter-proof Poison Heal Pokemon like Xerneas and Mega Mewtwo X. Mega Audino can Imposter-proof many defensive Pokemon such as Giratina and Yveltal, which in return can check dangerous attackers that overwhelm Mega Audino; for example, Giratina can check Regigigas and Mega Mewtwo X, while Yveltal can check Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar. Since this Mega Audino set deters opposing Imposter Pokemon from switching in by being able to deny their recovery from it or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp or Knock Off, Pokemon such as Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y that appreciate opposing Imposter Pokemon being crippled or weakened are good partners. If Purify is run, a separate way to Imposter-proof Mega Audino is needed; this can be any Pokemon that doesn't mind having its item removed, such as Registeel, Ferrothorn, or Ho-Oh.</p>"

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn's reasonable 74 / 131 / 116 bulk and many resistances allow it to act as a reliable check to many specific threats, including Poison Heal users such as Primal Kyogre, Regigigas, and Xerneas, as well as check a variety of other Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y, and Zekrom. Ferrothorn has a niche over the bulkier Registeel and other Steel-types mainly thanks to its Grass typing, which offers a neutrality to Ground-type attacks, a resistance to Water and Electric, and a key immunity to Spore that other Steel-types must forego another item to gain through Safety Goggles. Ferrothorn also benefits from its lower Speed stat, which helps with slow pivoting and utilizing Core Enforcer to suppress abilities. In addition to its many resistances, Flash Fire is used to remove the 4x weakness to Fire, which is a common coverage type for Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Xerneas. Thanks to its dual typing, Ferrothorn can check some Zekrom and Primal Kyogre sets, which other Steel-types struggle with. The main drawbacks of Ferrothorn are the competition it faces from Registeel due to Registeel's higher bulk and its lack of Ice and Flying resistances, which limits its use in checking most Mega Diancie sets and Kyurem-B, an otherwise common role for Steel-types. Its lower bulk, while mitigated by resistances, does limit Ferrothorn's ability to take hits from wallbreakers that can hit it neutrally such as Adaptability Mega Gengar and Mega Garchomp. Also, Ferrothorn suffers from being predictable due to almost always needing Flash Fire to avoid OHKOs from common Fire-type coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unaware is also an option for Ferrothorn, allowing it to better check Pokemon with setup that lack Fire moves such as Zekrom and Primal Kyogre, but due to its easily exploitable weakness, Ferrothorn needs considerably more team support when using this set. Unaware Ferrothorn utilizes similar moves to the Flash Fire set, but a utility move such as Defog or Stealth Rock replaces Spectral Thief or Topsy-Turvy. Ferrothorn can make a good Defogger due to its ability to switch into most defensive and some offensive Stealth Rock setters (such as Mega Diancie) and immunity to Toxic Spikes and resistance to Stealth Rock. Ferrothorn can also set Stealth Rock effectively when running Anchor Shot, since this stops Imposter users from setting hazards themselves more than once. Other status moves such as Toxic or Poison Fang can be employed to make Ferrothorn harder to switch into, with the added benefit that they cannot be used against it by Imposter users. These can help to cripple or wear down some of its checks such as Mega Mewtwo X and can also cripple and force out some defensive Pokemon, such as Magic Bounce Giratina and RegenVest Kyogre. Prankster Ferrothorn can be used but is largely outclassed by other Steel-types such as Registeel and Aegislash, as they have better bulk and crucial resistances to Ice- and Flying-type attacks, letting them reliably check Xerneas and Kyurem-B sets. Also, because of its 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks, Ferrothorn will usually be OHKOed when switching into Fire-type coverage moves such as V-create from Pixilate Mega Diancie if the opponent predicts correctly, whereas other Steel-types would survive. However, Prankster Ferrothorn does provide a more reliable Regigigas check than Prankster Registeel or Aegislash. Worry Seed can be used over Entrainment to largely the same effect and can even remove Normalize from Mega Gengar after it uses Entrainment, stopping it from giving Normalize to any more teammates until it switches. However, Ferrothorn is far from being a Mega Gengar check, and Entrainment has more PP, so this should be seen as an emergency option on teams lacking a real check. Rocky Helmet is an option that can be useful in wearing down opposing pivots that utilize U-turn and Mega Diancie if it uses Fake Out or Extreme Speed as Ferrothorn switches in. However, not using Leftovers makes Ferrothorn much harder to keep healthy and increases the number of moves that can 2HKO it, such as Water Spout from Primal Kyogre in rain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Mewtwo X</strong>: Thanks to Mega Mewtwo X's base 190 Attack, its super effective STAB Fighting-type attacks threaten to OHKO Ferrothorn even without boosting ability or item. Mega Mewtwo X can also come in on most of Ferrothorn's moves with minimal risk, with Anchor Shot being a 5HKO and even Spectral Thief only a possible 3HKO. However, sets with Will-O-Wisp can cripple most Mega Mewtwo X if it switches in directly.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers with neutral or super effective STAB moves are rarely threatened by Ferrothorn and will typically do enough damage to force it out. Examples include Adaptability Mega Garchomp and Choice Band Mega Tyranitar, both of which can cleanly 2HKO Ferrothorn, even if it removes their abilities after the first hit with Core Enforcer or Entrainment, and can survive any of Ferrothorn's moves comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Choice Specs Kyurem-W and other Refrigerate users</strong>: Choice Specs Kyurem-W outspeed and OHKO Ferrothorn with its -ate Boombursts. Kyurem-W can be 2HKOed by Anchor Shot, so it is a softer check; it is forced out if it switches into Entrainment, but there is little cost to this besides momentum. Non-Choice Specs Refrigerate Kyurem-B also threatens Ferrothorn but not to quite the same degree.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Normalize Mega Gengar easily forces out Ferrothorn since after using Entrainment, Mega Gengar will be immune to most or all of Ferrothorn's moves, allowing it to set up or attack Ferrothorn with no cost. Other Mega Gengar sets such as Choice Specs Adaptability can do a lot of damage to Ferrothorn and KO after some prior damage. However, due to Mega Gengar's low bulk and the fear of losing Normalize to Entrainment, it is unlikely to be switched in directly.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Many Pokemon that Ferrothorn can often check will force it out or even counter it if they run unusual Fighting-type coverage such as Secret Sword Xerneas and Mega Mewtwo Y.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shore Up offers reliable recovery, allowing Ferrothorn to stay healthy throughout the battle and switch in more frequently, enabling it to be an effective wall. Anchor Shot traps Imposter users to self-Imposter-proof the set, as well as Poison Heal users, which are then KOed once their ability is removed. Anchor Shot is also a reasonably powered STAB attack that threatens some Pokemon that Ferrothorn can check, such as Xerneas and especially Mega Diancie, to force them out. Anchor Shot's good PP helps with trapping to PP stall. U-turn utilizes Ferrothorn's low Speed to slow pivot, which can be used to gain momentum and potentially bring in wallbreakers without risk. However, without Anchor Shot, the set is much more passive, as it cannot force out Mega Diancie and requires a separate Pokemon to Imposter-proof it. Entrainment and Core Enforcer are both used to remove abilities, especially Poison Heal. Entrainment can affect Xerneas and other Fairy-types and has more PP, whereas Core Enforcer can do valuable chip damage and break Focus Sash. Entrainment also reveals the abilities of foes, which can be useful for scouting and is effective if the opponent switches. Ferrothorn can also use Will-O-Wisp as a possible alternative to ability removal, crippling some switch-ins that can otherwise take advantage of its passivity, most notably Mega Mewtwo X, and providing valuable chip damage against other defensive Pokemon. However, without Entrainment or Core Enforcer, Topsy-Turvy is necessary to check Regigigas, and certain variations of Poison Heal sweepers will be harder to deal with. Spectral Thief and Topsy-Turvy both prevent setup, which helps to reduce how much Ferrothorn's passivity can be exploited, making it a more reliable answer to Poison Heal sweepers, which typically use setup and can otherwise break through more easily after some prior damage or with Lovely Kiss. Topsy-Turvy can affect Regigigas but is blocked by Substitute, whereas Spectral Thief leaves Ferrothorn less passive and can threaten Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar, which can otherwise set up with little risk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flash Fire removes Ferrothorn's otherwise crippling Fire weakness, allowing it to check Mega Diancie and Poison Heal Xerneas, which often have Fire coverage. A Sassy nature is used to better check Poison Heal Kyogre, which otherwise has a chance to 2HKO with Water Spout after using Quiver Dance, and to take less from -ate Boomburst from Pokemon such as Mega Diancie. This nature also minimizes Speed, making Core Enforcer more effective at suppressing abilities. Maximum EVs are invested in every stat except in Speed for maximum bulk and damage output. Leftovers helps to compensate for Ferrothorn's slightly lackluster bulk to avoid key 2HKOs such as from Water Spout Primal Kyogre at +1 or in rain. Leftovers also provides passive recovery, which allows it to switch into defensive Pokemon and entry hazards with less risk of being worn down and preserves recovery PP against a trapped Imposter user.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As with most sets in BH, Ferrothorn is best used after careful scouting. This helps to avoid switching into lures such as Tinted Lens Primal Kyogre or into moves such as Trick and Fighting-type coverage, both of which can affect its ability to consistently check other threats. If the opponent's team has a Regigigas or a Xerneas with Poison Heal, Ferrothorn should be used carefully to avoid being worn down or KOed by a lure, since these sweepers are difficult to play around without a dedicated answer. Ferrothorn's immunity to poison and resistances to Core Enforcer and Stealth Rock let it switch into a variety of passive Pokemon, such as some Giratina sets, with very low risk. Anchor Shot should usually be used against Imposter users or if a switch to an Imposter user is predicted, as it will trap them and remove them from the battle, as well as against Poison Heal users that need to be trapped. Thanks to Anchor Shot's high PP, it can be used liberally and can dissuade most frail Pokemon from switching in. Once the opposing Pokemon's sets have been scouted, it's possible other Pokemon will be vulnerable to trapping as well. If Core Enforcer is used, the PP should be conserved (especially if Ferrothorn is being used to PP stall), since without it, Ferrothorn fails to counter Regigigas and, when not running Topsy-Turvy, can even be set up on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Ferrothorn cannot check -ate users such as Kyurem-W, a Pokemon to check them such as Fur Coat Chansey or a Soundproof user such as Mega Slowbro (which also resists Fighting-type attacks) is appreciated. Mega Tyranitar is a good partner, as it helps against Giratina and RegenVest Yveltal and appreciates Ferrothorn dealing with Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Mega Diancie. Imposter users make good teammates to scout for lures such as Secret Sword Xerneas and Tinted Lens Primal Kyogre. Giratina is a good partner, as it can cover Ferrothorn's Fighting weakness thanks to its Ghost typing, which allows it to check many Mega Mewtwo X sets, while Ferrothorn can comfortably switch into Xerneas, Mega Diancie, and Dragon-type attacks such as Core Enforcer. Other Mega Mewtwo X checks such as Cresselia can make good partners for Ferrothorn; depending on the set, Cresselia can also check many wallbreakers that force out Ferrothorn.</p>"

  "Zekrom": {
    "overview": "<p>Zekrom's high offensive capabilities combined with its anti-meta STAB combination allow it to consistently beat standard sets of common defensive Pokemon such as Giratina, Registeel, Zygarde-C, and Primal Kyogre. Also, its resistance to Flying and Steel combined with its bulk allows it to stay in on various offensive Pokemon such as Kartana and offensive Necrozma-DM lacking Precipice Blades. Due to these factors as well as Zekrom being the most viable Electric-type in BH, Zekrom finds a niche as an anti-meta Pokemon that can capitalize on most teams not having a reliable way to beat it.</p> <p>However, despite having some great resistances, Dragon is one of the most prepared-for defensive types in the metagame due to the presence of Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Mega Garchomp. As such, Zekrom is frequently hit by Ice- and Fairy-type coverage and revenge killed by -ate users. As most offensive teams will have multiple of these Pokemon, Zekrom finds difficulty in setting up on them. In addition, though uncommon, Ferrothorn and Mega Steelix generally stop Zekrom cold. Zekrom is also unable to run significantly different sets; one check to Zekrom will generally check all of Zekrom's sets. Zekrom can be difficult to Imposter-proof, making it difficult to fit onto a team. Zekrom generally finds itself struggling to sweep if it cannot find an opportunity to set up, as it lacks the sheer power that other Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X have, making it more difficult to use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Zekrom has little room for variance outside of its two main sets. It can run a Choice Band Tough Claws set with Bolt Strike, Dragon Hammer, Close Combat, and another move. However, Zekrom likes being able to sweep teams and not being locked into moves due to the prevalence of Pokemon that are immune to its STAB moves. Fake Out on Galvanize can be run over Shell Smash for better revenge killing utility, but Zekrom loses the ability to set up, which makes it weak and reduces its wallbreaking potency. Dazzling can be run to lure priority users, but Zekrom does not enjoy losing out on the power of Adaptability or Galvanize. Surge Surfer is usable on Electric Terrain teams, but Zekrom often appreciates the power boost from both Electric Terrain and its ability of choice and will often have a boost in speed from Shell Smash anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pixilate and Refrigerate users</strong>: Kyurem-B revenge kills all Zekrom sets handily while also resisting Galvanize Extreme Speed. Mega Diancie can also revenge kill Zekrom but does not resist Extreme Speed, so it must avoid being in KO range after Zekrom uses Shell Smash.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn and Mega Steelix</strong>: Ferrothorn and Mega Steelix are resistant to Zekrom's STAB combination. Due to this and their good bulk, they are able to effectively check Zekrom and potentially burn it, trap and beat it, or remove its item.</p> <p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Galvanize sets have a hard time breaking through most Unaware Pokemon, while Unaware Pokemon such as Registeel are free to do as they please versus Galvanize Zekrom. Adaptability handily beats every Unaware user in the metagame except for Ferrothorn and Mega Steelix, however.</p> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Zekrom rarely carries coverage for Shedinja, so Shedinja walls most Zekrom sets.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mega Swampert and Primal Groudon can check unboosted Zekrom. However, they must be wary after a Shell Smash, as Zekrom can OHKO them with its Z-Move from the Adaptability set. Primal Groudon can run Misty Surge prior to Primal Reversion to circumvent this for a short period of time.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: It is important to keep Zekrom away from being poisoned, burned, or put to sleep, as all three of these status conditions can heavily reduce Zekrom's offensive presence.</p>",

      "Adaptability Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bolt Strike in conjunction with Life Orb 2HKOes anything that does not resist it and OHKOes anything weak to it. In particular, it 2HKOes Mega Audino and Registeel while OHKOing Yveltal, Mega Gyarados, and Primal Kyogre. Even without Life Orb, Bolt Strike still OHKOes Water-types and Flying-types. Draco Meteor serves as the secondary STAB move of choice, OHKOing every relevant Dragon-type in the metagame after Shell Smash unless they have Unaware. Shell Smash is the best setup move for this set, as it boosts both offensive stats and Speed. This lets Zekrom OHKO many Pokemon after a boost that it previously could not OHKO, including Mega Audino and Mega Mewtwo Y. Taunt serves as an option to prevent Zekrom's targets from recovering health or using Topsy-Turvy to neuter its sweeping potential, and also helps against Prankster Registeel, preventing it from using Destiny Bond on Zekrom without being forced out next turn.</p> <p>Core Enforcer serves as a more consistent STAB option due to not dropping Special Attack in addition to taking away Prankster from Pokemon that use it. However, it is weaker than Draco Meteor, meaning Zekrom will have a weaker Z-Move and miss some 2HKOs and OHKOs such as on Primal Groudon and Giratina. Clanging Scales can be used if a Soundproof Pokemon is being used to wall Impostered Zekrom. However, it drops Zekrom's Defense, undermining its good physical bulk and leaving it more vulnerable to priority. Close Combat can be run over Taunt if Zekrom wishes to beat Ferrothorn and Mega Steelix; however, replacing Taunt makes Zekrom's matchup versus Prankster Pokemon and other walls drastically worse.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Rash nature boosts Zekrom's Special Attack to its fullest potential while taking away from Zekrom's Special Defense so its offensive capabilities and ability to take priority attacks aren't hindered. The Special Attack boost allows it to achieve better rolls on threats such as Primal Groudon, Imposter Pokemon and Ferrothorn, thus requiring less chip damage. Dragonium Z offers a one-time nuke, hitting many targets hard as well as OHKOing Zygarde-C and Giratina with no setup. Life Orb offers a more consistent boost in power and lets Draco Meteor OHKO Giratina and Zygarde-C at the cost of taking recoil every turn, which may be detrimental because Zekrom then has a limit put on how many attacks it can use at the start of the game and is more prone to being revenge killed. Adaptability boosts Zekrom's STAB moves, turning it into a powerful threat that can 2HKO most Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be sure to scout for moves that Zekrom does not appreciate, including power-neutering ones like Core Enforcer and Spectral Thief, before setting it up for a sweep. Being burned is possibly the worst status condition for Zekrom because it halves the damage Bolt Strike does, so it is wise to avoid this scenario if possible. Scouting for Will-O-Wisp, Scald, and Beak Blast will allow you to avoid unnecessary burns. If there is a check to Zekrom on the field, be sure to weaken or eliminate it beforehand so Zekrom can sweep. Eliminating Mega Diancie in particular is important, as it can revenge kill Zekrom very easily with no fear of Extreme Speed. Unaware Pokemon such as Mega Audino can cause trouble as well, as they can take a hit before doing whatever they wish to Zekrom. Prankster Haze and Destiny Bond also neuter Zekrom's chances of sweeping.</p> <p>Set up on Pokemon that Zekrom can force out, such as Yveltal, Mega Gyarados, and Primal Kyogre. Be wary of Zekrom's damage output. While it hits hard, there are some Pokemon that it does not OHKO and can retaliate with a crippling move like Knock Off, Spectral Thief, or Core Enforcer. Be sure that Zekrom will force out the foe by threatening to KO unboosted before setting it up, as foes can otherwise use the chance to attack with a crippling move. Note that Draco Meteor will not OHKO Giratina and Zygarde-C without Life Orb and that they can hit back with a Core Enforcer as well, so it's important to play Z-Move Zekrom with caution.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electric Terrain is useful for boosting the power of Zekrom's Bolt Strike in addition to making Zekrom immune to sleep and potentially eliminating Misty Terrain, letting Zekrom use its Dragon-type attack of choice without being weakened. Zekrom also appreciates entry hazard support; Spikes in particular is pretty helpful for chipping Ferrothorn and Steelix better than Stealth Rock does, and both can KO Shedinja to help Zekrom's sweep. Zekrom appreciates having Mega Diancie to lure in and potentially beat Ferrothorn and Mega Steelix with Fighting- or Ground-type coverage. Fur Coat Chansey is a good partner to Zekrom, as it walls all relevant variants of Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B, two Pokemon that revenge kill Zekrom. Fur Coat Chansey can also help Imposter-proof Zekrom in a pinch. If you are using Life Orb, you can run Z-Parting Shot on Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Giratina to further Zekrom's longevity if needed as well as provide a safe switch and a potential opportunity to set up. Zekrom appreciates checks to Pixilate and Refrigerate users, as they revenge kill it handily. Flash Fire Steel-types, Ho-Oh, and Fur Coat Chansey can all fulfill this role.</p> <p>Poison Heal sweepers such as Xerneas and Regigigas can heavily pressure offensive teams, which have many ways of dealing with Zekrom. In return, Zekrom deals massive damage to most of Xerneas's and Regigigas's checks, such as Ho-Oh and Giratina. Ghost-types can be used as a switch-in to Shedinja, which comes in on Zekrom for free most of the time. Unaware Ferrothorn, RegenVest or Unaware Mega Steelix, and Shedinja can Imposterproof this Zekrom set very reliably. Steel-types can help check the Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-types that Zekrom may have trouble with, such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B.</p>"

      "Mixed Galvanize Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash is the best setup move for Zekrom, as it increases its offensive stats and Speed in a single turn. The offensive boosts allow Zekrom to OHKO more Pokemon in general as well as better handle offensive teams if it does find the opportunity to set up. Extreme Speed outprioritizes Prankster moves and does good damage to every Prankster Pokemon that does not resist it. It also shares priority with other Extreme Speed users such as Mega Diancie, Refrigerate Mega Mewtwo X, and Kyurem-B, but only goes first when boosted. Boomburst handles Pokemon that have the ability Dazzling and functions as a hard-hitting attack in general, notably 2HKOing Mega Audino unlike Frustration. Judgment handles Dragon-types such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Mega Garchomp as well as other Pokemon that resist Electric like Primal Groudon and Mega Swampert. Judgment also helps Zekrom beat Imposter, as Imposter users generally lack a Plate, which allows Zekrom to hit them super effectively while they cannot.</p> <p>Frustration is usable over Boomburst to hit physically defensive Pokemon harder than Extreme Speed or for when the priority isn't needed and PP should be preserved, but the loss in power from Boomburst is not appreciated. Close Combat can be used to break Ferrothorn and Mega Steelix and Sunsteel Strike is an option to beat Unaware Mega Audino and Shedinja. However, it can be difficult to find space on the set, as Zekrom generally requires all four of its moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Draco Plate allows Zekrom to gain STAB on Judgment while making sure Imposter users don't. It also boosts the damage of Judgment to the equivalent of 120 Base Power, allowing an unboosted Zekrom to 2HKO Dragon-types such as Zygarde-C, Kyurem-B, and Giratina. Galvanize boosts the power of Extreme Speed, Boomburst and Frustration while also granting Zekrom STAB on these attacks, assisting it in KOing Primal Kyogre, Yveltal, and Mega Gyarados. A Rash nature allows it to have as much power possible on Judgment and Boomburst while also making sure Speed isn't lost and less damage is taken from Mega Diancie's and Kyurem-B's Extreme Speed. A Rash nature also gives Zekrom great chances of OHKOing Primal Groudon and Mega Audino after a Shell Smash and Stealth Rock damage while also increasing the amount of damage dealt to Imposter Pokemon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set Zekrom up on Pokemon it forces out, such as Primal Kyogre, Yveltal, and Celesteela. Make sure that Zekrom's checks are weakened before it sweeps; while they're rare enough, they do exist and need to be scouted. These checks include Mega Steelix, Ferrothorn, and Mega Diancie. Playing around Prankster Destiny Bond or Prankster Encore is a mind game. Depending on the Pokemon you should carefully evaluate the possibility of a one-for-one trade if Zekrom cannot beat the Pokemon with Prankster Destiny Bond. However, Zekrom can also play mind games with Extreme Speed, so you may not have to make that decision at all. Use double switches or slow pivoting to get Zekrom in; while it has good bulk and a nice defensive typing, it lacks recovery and is dependent on its item to sweep most teams. Galvanize Zekrom is able to also provide revenge killing utility to its team, picking off weakened offensive Pokemon as well as sufficiently weakened Prankster Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Zekrom largely appreciates Electric Terrain support, as the added power turns it into a frightening wallbreaker if being a sweeper is not needed at the moment. However, it also massively boosts Zekrom's sweeping power as well as its odds of beating Prankster Registeel lacking Encore, allowing Boomburst to 2HKO it. Zekrom appreciates entry hazard support which can assist in breaking Focus Sashes as well as chipping Pokemon into KO range of an attack. In particular, Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes beats Shedinja and lets +2 Zekrom OHKO Primal Groudon with Judgment and OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y with Boomburst. Zekrom appreciates Mega Mewtwo X's ability to force out Ferrothorn and Mega Steelix, as the two can pressure the opposing team with double switches and U-turn. This strategy works especially well if there are entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field. Zekrom also appreciates Mega Garchomp's ability to beat Primal Groudon and be another difficult Pokemon to switch into due to the two often not being prepared for on the same team, but the two Dragon-types share weaknesses to Fairy-, Ice- and Dragon-types. Zekrom appreciates Pixilate and Refrigerate checks, such as Fur Coat Chansey and Flash Fire Steel-types. Users of those two abilities can effectively revenge kill Zekrom, meaning it is crucial to have a way to beat them.</p> <p>Zekrom has excellent synergy with offensive Poison Heal users, as they can trouble more offensive teams that Zekrom might have difficulty against. In return, Zekrom can 2HKO most of the checks to offensive Poison Heal users such as Giratina, Celesteela, and Zygarde-C. Giratina, Ferrothorn, and Mega Steelix can Imposter-proof Zekrom due to resisting Normal and Electric, since Imposter will not have Draco Plate and will therefore have all of its moves be converted to Electric-type. Slow pivoting to get Zekrom in safely can be beneficial, as hard switching can risk Zekrom taking heavy damage, losing its item, or being statused. Steel-types can help check the Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-types that Zekrom may have trouble with, such as Mega Diancie and Kyurem-B.</p>"

  "Kyurem-Black": {
    "overview": "<p>Kyurem-B differentiates itself from other -ate users with its Ice-type STAB attacks, giving it a superior matchup against Dragon-types like Giratina and Zygarde-C, which other -ate users typically rely on boosting items or prior damage to threaten to OHKO. In addition, its base 95 Speed and resistance to Water also give Kyurem-B a good chance to take on Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Despite its slightly lower Attack than Mega Mewtwo X and its mediocre Special Attack, Kyurem-B still gives some archetypes a hard time, as the combination of its Refrigerate-boosted STAB attacks and coverage moves leaves opposing teams with very few Pokemon that can safely pivot into it. To specify, Kyurem-B beats traditional -ate checks such as Celesteela and Soundproof Mega Slowbro and is able to threaten some staples of the metagame such as Primal Groudon more than other -ate users thanks to its Ice STAB attacks, putting large amounts of pressure on Steel-types and forcing fairly predictable counterplay that can be easily circumvented. Imposter users also cannot consistently take advantage of Kyurem-B due to its decent bulk being primarily weighted in its HP stat. However, Kyurem-B still often faces competition with other -ate users. For example, Mega Diancie has better damage output that allows it to provide its team with slightly better security against offensive foes and can viably run more specialized sets to circumvent its defensive checks. In addition, when compared to other -ate users, Kyurem-B can't offensively check anything in particular, unlike Mega Diancie, which has more relevant resistances and therefore finds more opportunities to switch in. Kyurem-B's reliance on priority moves to combat faster threats also leaves it vulnerable to getting revenge killed by foes like Mega Mewtwo X and Kartana.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As Kyurem-B can threaten a variety of foes with its STAB attacks and coverage moves, a Choice Band set using Tough Claws running Ice Hammer, Bolt Strike, Close Combat, and Sunsteel Strike may be an appealing option. Refrigerate sets can also use Choice Band to use a stronger Extreme Speed and heavily pressure defensive walls with coverage moves like Precipice Blades, Bolt Strike, or even with Trick. However, these sets may struggle to threaten offensive teams, and there are more threatening Choice Band wallbreakers to choose, such as Mega Mewtwo X and Kartana. Kyurem-B's lower Speed stat can also cause further problems against faster teams when running this set. Sunsteel Strike on the Refrigerate set hits Sturdy Shedinja but lacks other utility. Life Orb is a possible item to improve Kyurem-B's general damage output, giving it a good chance to 2HKO Mega Slowbro with Boomburst after Stealth Rock damage and OHKO Primal Kyogre and Mega Gyarados with Bolt Strike. However, Life Orb can wear down Kyurem-B quite quickly, and Kyurem-B already suffers from its high susceptibility to residual damage. Safety Goggles can be used to prevent Kyurem-B from being neutralized by Spore, though forgoing Icicle Plate makes a visible difference in damage output, making it a less optimal option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Priority Users</strong>: Mega Diancie can easily threaten Kyurem-B by threatening to outspeed and OHKO it with Pixilate-boosted Extreme Speed after minimal prior damage. Triage Mega Charizard Y holding a Life Orb can easily OHKO a slightly damaged Kyurem-B after setting up Tail Glow. Due to their general prevalence, the amount of time that Kyurem-B can stay in the field is quite limited.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Mega Slowbro can easily switch into Kyurem-B lacking Bolt Strike, and it can even shrug off Bolt Strike if it has Fur Coat. Fur Coat Chansey and less common walls like Cresselia and Mega Aggron can avoid being 2HKOed by Kyurem-B.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Kyurem-B's middling Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to getting revenge killed by faster threats like Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Kartana. These Pokemon must be healthy enough to survive Kyurem-B's Extreme Speed to retaliate, however. Faster Poison Heal users like Regigigas and Xerneas are bulky enough to take Extreme Speed from Kyurem-B as long as they have not been overly weakened and can use Kyurem-B as a setup fodder with sleep-inducing moves.</p> <p><strong>Dazzling and Queenly Majesty</strong>: Kyurem-B is typically reliant on Extreme Speed to perform its important roles against offensive teams, and this means users of Dazzling and Queenly Majesty, such as Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo X, can punish Kyurem-B's attempts to strike them first.</p> <p><strong>Eviolite Imposter Chansey</strong>: Imposter Chansey's effectiveness as a pivot against Kyurem-B may vary on whether Kyurem-B has moves like Close Combat, but it can switch into Kyurem-B at least a few times and force it out with its superior bulk.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Shedinja</strong>: Unless Kyurem-B has Sunsteel Strike, it gets completely walled by Sturdy Shedinja and is forced out by the threat of Endeavor.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Kyurem-B's weakness to Stealth Rock, as well as its vulnerability to other entry hazards, can reduce its longevity.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Extreme Speed is useful for its increased priority bracket and high damage output against offensive threats like Mega Gengar, giving Kyurem-B a needed countermeasure against faster foes and providing the team with revenge killing utility. Boomburst enables Kyurem-B to use a stronger Ice-type attack, do much higher damage to physically defensive foes like Primal Groudon and Fur Coat users like Mega Slowbro, and potentially punish Dazzling users that attempt to take advantage of a predicted Extreme Speed. Bolt Strike gives Kyurem-B crucial coverage against Water-types, preventing Primal Kyogre, Mega Gyarados, and the less common Mega Slowbro from walling this set. Its decent chance to paralyze opposing Pokemon can also be handy against foes that Kyurem-B struggles to bypass and Imposter users that may pivot into Kyurem-B on a pinch. Fake Out further strengthens Kyurem-B's matchup against offensive teams, letting it deal free damage, which is always useful. This also sometimes allows Kyurem-B to take out a threat that cannot be taken down by Extreme Speed alone. Return is a stronger Refrigerate-boosted STAB physical attack that has significantly more PP than Extreme Speed and is powerful enough to have a chance to OHKO Giratina after Stealth Rock damage and cleanly 2HKO Assault Vest Dialga and Mega Audino. Note that forgoing coverage against Water-types or a secondary priority move makes Return often a questionable choice, however. Stealth Rock can be used instead to pressure opposing teams if offensive threats can be sufficiently covered by Kyurem-B's teammates. Precipice Blades targets Flash Fire Steel-types like Registeel and Aegislash that commonly pivot into Kyurem-B, 2HKOing them on the switch. Precipice Blades also serves as a decently strong neutral attack against Water-types if Kyurem-B lacks Bolt Strike. Close Combat is a more accurate coverage move against Steel-types that also hits Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Fur Coat Chansey hard. It fails to cover some Steel-types like Aegislash and Necrozma-DM, however. V-create is a stronger coverage move against Steel-types, having enough power to OHKO many Steel-types with minimal prior damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Lonely nature is typically preferred, as Kyurem-B needs the extra power to 2HKO Registeel with Precipice Blades and do the maximum amount of damage to faster foes with Extreme Speed. Another important benchmark of this nature includes enabling Kyurem-B to KO Primal Kyogre and Mega Gyarados with Bolt Strike after they switch into any other attack. Alternatively, a Naive nature can be considered to outspeed positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, but it is rare for said Pokemon to run maximum Speed, and the loss of power isn't generally worth it. Refrigerate turns Kyurem-B's Normal-type attacks into boosted Ice-type STAB attacks, making moves like Extreme Speed and Boomburst significantly more powerful. Boomburst can OHKO Giratina after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Mega Audino. Icicle Plate further boosts the power of Kyurem-B's Ice-type STAB attacks, making it an effective mixed attacker that can 2HKO a good number of neutral Pokemon in the metagame, including Mega Audino and Xerneas. Expert Belt can be used instead to increase the odds that Kyurem-B will net OHKOs with super effective attacks like V-create on Registeel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kyurem-B will not have many opportunities to liberally switch into the field. It takes sizeable damage from Stealth Rock upon switching in, and because of its average Speed stat, it is unable to double switch effectively due to its vulnerability to many faster threats, particularly opposing -ate users that can strike Kyurem-B first. Kyurem-B is generally forced to play with caution and should prefer entering the field by slow pivoting or when it has to revenge kill a foe. Once in, Kyurem-B will have opportunities to surprise and punish its switch-ins with its coverage moves. Due to Ice being less popular of an offensive typing, some teams are loosely prepared for Kyurem-B and tend to rely on offensive pressure or Imposter to keep it in control. Offensive pressure can be dealt with if Kyurem-B is defensively supported by its teammates, but keeping Imposter users in line will require more aggressive strategies, such as using entry hazards or strictly securing momentum. Make sure that foes like Registeel and Primal Kyogre that attempt to sponge hits from Kyurem-B are harshly punished with appropriate coverage moves and weakened enough to be easily taken out by another teammate if Kyurem-B does not get to KO them itself. Kyurem-B also proves to be an annoyance for offensive teams, as not many viable Pokemon from such archetypes resist Ice and some teams rely on a single Steel-type to check -ate users, which Kyurem-B can easily bypass with a coverage move. As it will force a lot of switches against faster threats once they are revealed to lack abilities like Dazzling, setting entry hazards can be helpful for further punishing switch-ins. Though Kyurem-B is capable of doing a good amount of damage to many foes early- and mid-game, it can also be a cleaner late-game. Identify the opposing team's structure and draft plans to use Kyurem-B appropriately. Scouting for opposing abilities is crucially important. Foes like Mega Mewtwo Y with Dazzling can be very dangerous should Kyurem-B waste its turn by choosing a priority attack and give them a chance to set up. Lastly, be cautious about Extreme Speed's PP. If it is wasted on foes that resist it, it will hinder Kyurem-B's revenge killing capabilities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types typically become necessary, as Kyurem-B will usually be forced out against opposing -ate users. Most of them can easily justify a slow pivoting move that can help Kyurem-B enter the field easily. However, note that they stack weaknesses to Fighting-types with Kyurem-B, making adding Aegislash for compressing defensive roles or Giratina to cover Fighting-types a good idea. Steel-types can also set entry hazards that Kyurem-B can take advantage of due to the number of switches it easily forces, and they can pivot to bring Kyurem-B in against Magic Bounce users. Depending on its coverage moves, Kyurem-B can be Imposter-proof by varying methods. Water-types can be a decent pivot to Kyurem-B lacking Bolt Strike, though Precipice Blades can be strong enough to 2HKO them on the switch if they are weakened enough. Mega Slowbro, especially Fur Coat variants, can easily wall any variant of Kyurem-B lacking Bolt Strike. Flash Fire Steel-types can be considered if Kyurem-B lacks Precipice Blades and Close Combat, and Fur Coat Chansey can effectively Imposter-proof Kyurem-B, as it easily avoids a 2HKO from any moves. Many offensive partners can benefit from Kyurem-B's ability to bring pressure to the table against offensive foes and certain Steel-types. Primal Groudon can threaten most Steel-types that Kyurem-B may struggle with, provide Stealth Rock support, and pivot into Mega Diancie. Kyurem-B in return pressures Celesteela that can typically check Primal Groudon well with an ability that makes it immune to Fire. Giratina and Zygarde-C, though they share weaknesses to Fairy-types, can provide useful defensive presences against Regigigas and Mega Mewtwo X. As Kyurem-B naturally threatens Giratina and Zygarde-C, can threaten Primal Kyogre with Bolt Strike, and can potentially dispose of Mega Tyranitar and Ferrothorn with Close Combat, Poison Heal users like Regigigas, Primal Kyogre, and Xerneas make great partners, as they all appreciate these threats being weakened. All of them can absorb status and weaker attacks for Kyurem-B in return, and Xerneas is additionally able to switch into Core Enforcer. Entry hazard removers are needed for Kyurem-B to remain healthy. Defoggers like Giratina and Rapid Spinners like Dialga and Yveltal are able to fulfill this role. Imposter users with a Choice Scarf, Unaware users, and Prankster users can effectively take on Dazzling sweepers, which Kyurem-B cannot take down with priority moves.</p>"

  "Kyurem-White": {
    "overview": "<p>The combination of its Ice typing, immense Special Attack, and above-average Speed makes Kyurem-W an extremely powerful Refrigerate wallbreaker, outpacing the saturated base 90 Speed tier while also OHKOing almost every neutral foe with Choice Specs Boomburst and 2HKOing pretty much everything else. Its decent bulk and useful resistances courtesy of its Dragon typing also make it difficult for defensive Pokemon to wear down without the right coverage. Unfortunately, its typing still makes it easily forced out by offensive Pokemon, which usually happen to carry super effective coverage against it, as well as defensive threats, which limit its opportunities to switch in with common super effective attacks such as Core Enforcer and Anchor Shot. Also, Kyurem-W is hindered by status, and its reliance on its item to secure some crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs makes it susceptible to Knock Off. Additionally, it is easily worn down by entry hazards and takes super effective damage from Stealth Rock, which limits its momentum and puts it within easy KO range of many even neutral powerful attacks. Also, it's not quite fast enough for pure offense, as it's outsped and forced out by major threats such as Mega Diancie and Mega Mewtwo X, confining it to a wallbreaking role. Still, Kyurem-W's bulk is enough to allow it to survive one even super effective attack from some offensive threats like Mega Mewtwo Y and Dialga, letting it hit back hard with Boomburst.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Icicle Plate and Life Orb are options on the Refrigerate set, along with a mixed set of Boomburst, Extreme Speed, Bolt Strike, and Blue Flare. Generally, however, Choice Specs is more than powerful enough. Choice Scarf is also an option to KO a lot of frailer, faster offensive threats such as Mega Gengar, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Mewtwo X. However, Kyurem-W requires a lot of chip damage to effectively do so.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Because Kyurem-W relies on Choice Specs for power, the first step in countering it is predicting which move it will lock itself into. Bulky Pokemon that resist Ice like Primal Kyogre are the best counters to Kyurem-W, especially if they are not hit super effectively by common coverage. On top of this, Primal Kyogre often runs Assault Vest, making it an even more secure counter. RegenVest Pokemon like Dialga, Registeel, and Solgaleo in general are particularly good at checking Kyurem-W, as they can switch in, scout what move it will lock itself into, and switch out again to the appropriate counter, healing off the damage in the process. Other Steel-types such as non-Assault Vest Registeel and Aegislash can also check Kyurem-W, though most are least 2HKOed by Blue Flare and Earth Power and need high special bulk to confront it. Fur Coat Chansey also serves as a decent counter, as it can reliably tank hits when at full health, though it can lose to entry hazards and chip damage. Finally, with the right prediction and switches, Kyurem-W's low-PP coverage moves can be PP stalled by bulkier teams, especially as it is limited in move choice by its Choice Specs. However, this requires quite a bit of consistent prediction.</p> <p><strong>Soundproof</strong>: Certain Soundproof Pokemon such as Mega Audino are immune to Kyurem-W's main attack, Boomburst, and with enough special bulk, they can easily tank its coverage attacks. They must be wary of its Dragon-type coverage, however, as traditional Soundproof users such as Mega Slowbro get 2HKOed.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Shedinja</strong>: Without Moongeist Beam, Kyurem-W is completely walled by Sturdy Shedinja. Even if Kyurem-W does have Moongeist Beam, Sturdy Shedinja can still act as a check with the right prediction, as Moongeist Beam is a risky move for Kyurem-W to be locked into.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Kyurem-W is fairly slow, especially as it normally runs a Modest nature, so plenty of other offensive Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo X, Regigigas, and Mega Diancie outspeed it and can put it out of commission before it can attack. However, thanks to Kyurem-W's bulk, it is difficult to OHKO without using a powerful super effective STAB attack, so chip damage is required when relying on coverage moves from Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar and even STAB moves from weaker Pokemon such as Xerneas.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Kyurem-W is easily worn down by entry hazards, as it takes super effective damage from Stealth Rock, is put on a quick timer by poison from Toxic Spikes, and relies on switching in order to maintain offensive momentum, exacerbating its susceptibility to them.</p> <p><strong>Support Moves</strong>: Kyurem-W is reliant on both its ability and its item for maximum power. Thus, support moves that remove its item, such as Knock Off, and that neuter its ability, such as Core Enforcer, Entrainment, and Worry Seed, can temporarily decrease its power. Status also hurts Kyurem-W, especially paralysis from moves such as Nuzzle and Glare, slowing it down and preventing it from outspeeding the walls it is supposed to take down, and sleep from Spore, making it easier for other offensive Pokemon to shut it down.</p>",

      "Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst is Kyurem-W's main STAB move and quite easily spammable with few repercussions. Boosted by Refrigerate, Choice Specs, and STAB, it is immensely powerful and cuts through many of the metagame's tanks and walls alike, including Giratina, Zygarde-C, Primal Groudon, Dialga, Ho-Oh, and Mega Tyranitar. The second slot is typically used for coverage, specifically to hit Steel-types. Earth Power is most reliable, as common Steel-types that resist it such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela fall to Boomburst. Blue Flare can also be used, as it combines power with coverage against every non-Flash Fire Steel-type. Alternatively, Magma Storm is an option that trades reliability for the ability to beat Shedinja and RegenVest Steel-types thanks to its trapping and residual damage. Secret Sword is another option, as despite having the lowest Base Power of the three, it is the most reliable, hitting every common Steel-type bar Aegislash. It also hits Mega Gyarados and inflicts physical damage, complementing Kyurem-W's special power well by hitting RegenVest users that resist Boomburst and other non-Imposter Chansey even harder than Magma Storm. The third slot is for additional coverage. Volt Switch lets Kyurem-B pivot out, letting it maintain offensive momentum and keep up the pressure on its typical counters while also dealing sizable damage to Water-types. Freeze-Dry specifically beats Water-types such as Primal Kyogre and Mega Gyarados and grants Kyurem-W a STAB move to use even if its ability is nullified, against a Pokemon like Giratina. Draco Meteor is a powerful secondary STAB move, but its Special Attack drop leaves Kyurem-W vulnerable afterwards. The last slot is mainly used for utility. Switcheroo is a great option, as this set is a very tempting lure for Soundproof and Steel-type walls that are very crippled by receiving Choice Specs. It also removes Assault Vests and Eviolites, making it easier for Kyurem-W or its teammates to break down opposing walls. However, it makes Kyurem-W more difficult to Imposter-proof against Choice Scarf users, as they can take advantage of it to Switcheroo their Choice Scarf onto your Imposter-proof Pokemon. Extreme Speed can also be used with a Rash nature so Kyurem-W can act as a revenge killer. However, its Extreme Speed is quite weak compared to that of other typical -ate users and is risky to be locked into. Knock Off is another option to remove items without forcing Kyurem-W to lose its Choice Specs, surprising and crippling Assault Vest users and Fur Coat Chansey. Finally, Moongeist Beam can be used for a better matchup against Shedinja and to hit Mega Slowbro and Giratina for decent damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Refrigerate is a must, providing Kyurem-W with the immensely powerful boosted and risk-free Ice-type Boomburst. Choice Specs amps up Kyurem-W's power, letting it secure important OHKOs against bulky foes such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, Mega Audino, and Dialga, as well as 2HKOs against bulky Pokemon that resist Boomburst and Fur Coat Chansey after Stealth Rock. This makes Kyurem-W incredibly difficult to switch into. Modest is the best nature, as it further boosts Kyurem-W's power. The extra Speed boost from Timid isn't particularly necessary, as the only thing it achieves is the guaranteed outpacing of maximum investment base 90 Speed Pokemon, which are rare and would not stay in anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kyurem-W exemplifies a hit-and-run playstyle, as it is immensely powerful and even has the bulk to come out on top in many one-on-one situations where it cannot OHKO the target but is quite easily revenge killed by faster or stronger attackers or walled by defensive foes after it takes down an opposing Pokemon. Bring it in with slow pivot attacks, especially as the chip damage can sometimes be enough to bring would-be checks and counters into KO range, and Kyurem-W absolutely needs to conserve its health to take on foes such as Imposter Chansey, Xerneas, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Gengar. Use Volt Switch to scout opposing Pokemon for support moves, especially Core Enforcer and Knock Off, the former of which deals super effective damage and neuters Refrigerate and the latter of which removes Choice Specs, both stifling a core source of Kyurem-W's power. Also, though it is not completely stopped by status, Kyurem-W should still avoid paralysis, which prevents it from outspeeding and KOing base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Primal Groudon. Once in, it is vital that Kyurem-W commits itself to the correct move. Boomburst is a pretty riskless, powerful move, so it can generally be freely used. Even Ice checks such as specially defensive Registeel and Solgaleo can be chipped into 2HKO range with the help of teammates. In safer situations where it is unlikely the foe will deal much damage back, it might be a good idea to use a coverage move or a Dragon STAB attack to nail potential Steel- and Water-type checks as they come in or use Volt Switch to pivot out to a teammate. Switcheroo can also be used to cripple counters as they come in, but this is generally only useful against more offensive teams where added power is unnecessary or when Kyurem-W's team cannot break through said counters otherwise. Volt Switch is a great move early-game, as no Ground-types will switch in to block it, and it can be used to scout for abilities like Soundproof on Pokemon coming in that would otherwise be unable to counter Kyurem-W as well as the aforementioned Core Enforcer and Knock Off. Maintaining offensive momentum is key to ensure the safest and fastest breaking down of opposing walls. Once a foe is successfully taken down, Kyurem-W will likely be forced out by revenge killers or confronted by walls that can handle the move it's locked into, so make sure to have a partner ready to handle them so momentum is not lost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In order for itself to function most effectively, Kyurem-W appreciates slow pivoting to pass it offensive momentum; entry hazard support and control to 2HKO virtually every single defensive counter with Boomburst, including Fur Coat Chansey and Registeel, without having to be worn down itself; and partners to Imposter-proof it, absorb status, and confront eventual revenge killers. There are several viable Pokemon that can fulfill multiple roles at once. Bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Aegislash, and Solgaleo pair extremely well with Kyurem-W, as they can pivot out to it, set entry hazards, Imposter-proof it, and confront offensive checks such as Mega Diancie. Ghost-types also make great partners, as, in addition to the above, Kyurem-W almost absolutely requires a Shedinja counter, as Shedinja is still one of its hardest counters and will almost certainly result in lost momentum if Kyurem-W locks itself into any move besides Moongeist Beam. Thus, Pokemon such as Giratina, Aegislash, and Mega Gengar also work well, especially as they can all also check Mega Mewtwo X, and Giratina and Aegislash can set hazards and provide slow pivoting support. A Shedinja of your own can also be used to Imposter-proof non-Switcheroo Kyurem-W as well as provide pivoting to bring it in safely. Many of the defensive Steel- and Ghost-types mentioned are also viable Defoggers, and Mega Gengar can even switch in to absorb Toxic Spikes. Because defensive foes need bulk-augmenting items such as Eviolite and Assault Vest to safely confront Kyurem-W, teammates that can remove such items with Knock Off, such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Audino, and Yveltal, pair with Kyurem-W well. RegenVest Mega Gyarados, along with other RevenVest users, are also effective partners to Imposter-proof Kyurem-W, providing momentum and tanking hits. In addition to all of this, Kyurem-W pairs really well with faster offensive Pokemon that capitalize upon its wallbreaking power. In particular, Mega Mewtwo X loves Zygarde-C and Giratina being kept in check, and Mega Mewtwo Y enjoys Dialga, Fur Coat Chansey, and Steel-types being worn down. They can also check and force out more offensive, wallbreaking foes that limit opportunities for Kyurem-W to come in. Stacking -ate users is also a potent strategy, as the combination of Choice Specs Refrigerate Kyurem-W and V-create Mega Diancie can quickly wear down opposing Steel-types and blow through opposing defenses, as most teams only carry one -ate check. Many physical attackers in the metagame especially appreciate Kyurem-W's powerful special coverage. Pokemon such as Poison Heal Regigigas and Primal Groudon form potent wallbreaking cores with Kyurem-W, as Regigigas can quite safely set up against most Steel-types while Primal Groudon simply plows past them. Poison Heal physical attackers such as Mega Mewtwo X work especially well, helping to shrug off status moves and Knock Off while also garnering momentum and safe switches in for Kyurem-W. Finally, many of the aforementioned Pokemon, including Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Gyarados, can also tackle Soundproof walls like Arceus and Mega Slowbro so Kyurem-W can spam Boomburst without fear.</p>"

  "Xerneas": {
    "overview": "<p>Xerneas's high stats across the board and good offensive and defensive typing allow it to run an effective offensive Poison Heal set, giving it added longevity to set up and damage the opposing team. If it is able to find an opportunity to set up using Quiver Dance, it can be difficult for offensive teams to defeat due to its added bulk, Special Attack, and Speed, as well as its passive recovery. Its Fairy typing gives it defensive utility via an immunity to Core Enforcer, which would otherwise have the potential to negate Poison Heal, as well as offensive utility by being super effective against some of the more common defensive Pokemon in the tier, Giratina and Zygarde-C. It also gives it useful resistances to both Fighting and Dark, as well as a resistance to U-turn and super effective STAB coverage against Dark and Fighting-types. These can be useful, as the Dark-type resistance allows Xerneas to be a reliable switch into Knock Off to provide utility to the rest of the team, while the Dragon-type immunity and the Fighting-type resistance can allow Xerneas to set up against Choice item users. It also has an immunity to Dragon-type attacks, which can be beneficial. However, Xerneas struggles to break past defensive Steel-type Pokemon, which hinders its offensive capabilities to a noticeable degree due to their prevalence in the metagame. The popularity of Flash Fire Steel-type Pokemon in particular is troublesome for Xerneas, as those Pokemon are able to wall Xerneas with its most common forms of coverage. Furthermore, though Xerneas is able to perform effectively with its Poison Heal set, it is outclassed with practically any other set. It isn't bulky enough to perform well with a purely defensive set, as Mega Audino would be able to, nor does it have the offensive stats to do well with a solely offensive set, as Mega Diancie would be able to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A purely defensive or utility-oriented Poison Heal set is plausible for Xerneas, running moves like Defog and Stealth Rock; however, it is generally outclassed defensively by Mega Audino. Fur Coat and Magic Bounce are alternative abilities for Xerneas, providing it with a more supportive role than an offensive Poison Heal set. Entry hazards can be run as the fourth move, as Xerneas is often able to force switches against threats such as Giratina and Yveltal, giving it an opportunity to set hazards. Taunt is an option, as it will prevent the foe from using status moves that would remove Poison Heal as well as prevent foes from recovering. Xerneas can also use an offensive set, such as Pixilate, working as a bulkier version of Mega Diancie; however, it is still generally outclassed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Defensive Steel-type Pokemon such as Registeel and Solgaleo can easily wall Xerneas if it hasn't had the opportunity to set up. They could remove Poison Heal, attack Xerneas with Sunsteel Strike, or phaze it. Steel-type Pokemon with Flash Fire in particular are able to effectively handle Xerneas. Flash Fire Ferrothorn excels as an answer to Xerneas, as it cannot be put to sleep with Spore and isn't weak to Earth Power. However, it is threatened by Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with Unaware such as Mega Audino are generally able to safely handle Xerneas, as it struggles to do too much damage without any boosts.</p> <p><strong>Fast Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Xerneas isn't particularly fast and as such needs to avoid being outsped and KOed by threats such as Kartana and Mega Gengar if it has not yet had the opportunity to set up.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves that Remove Abilities</strong>: Status moves that are able to remove abilities, such as Worry Seed, Gastro Acid, and Entrainment, are very problematic for Xerneas, as they remove its only form of healing and also cause it to receive damage from poison.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Bulky Fire-types such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon resist Xerneas's STAB option as well as its main coverage option.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Poison Heal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance allows Xerneas to boost its Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, allowing it to sweep opposing teams. Additionally, the Special Defense boost allows Xerneas to more reliably set up as well as effectively handle opposing Imposter Pokemon. Spore and Lovely Kiss are used to put foes to sleep and provide Xerneas with more opportunities to set up as well as grant it extra turns of Poison Heal recovery. Sleep is especially effective against RegenVest users, as they will be unable to pivot or cause damage, and faster Pokemon that Xerneas is unable to OHKO, granting Xerneas with either additional opportunities to attack or to set up. Sleep also allows Xerneas to handle Imposter users by granting it additional turns to damage them and preventing it from being put to sleep itself. Spore is generally recommended over Lovely Kiss due to its 100% accuracy; however, Lovely Kiss is still a viable option to run, as it is not blocked by Safety Goggles. Xerneas has a powerful STAB option in Moonblast, allowing it to hit important Pokemon such as Giratina and defensive Dark-types for super effective damage. It also provides strong neutral coverage towards a majority of the metagame. Lava Plume is useful to run on Xerneas, as it is able to cover opposing Steel-type Pokemon. Additionally, it is able to spread burns to passively damage foes, which can be especially helpful against Pokemon with Magic Bounce, such as Mega Audino, which are unable to be put to sleep, as well as against Shedinja, as a burn would KO it. Magma Storm is an alternative to Lava Plume, as it is still able to provide Xerneas with a strong move to damage opposing Steel-type Pokemon, in addition to partially trapping foes, which can be especially helpful against specially defensive foes such as Mega Audino and Imposter Chansey, as they could be passive and provide opportunities for Xerneas to use Quiver Dance while being unable to switch to a Pokemon that would have a better matchup against Xerneas. This move is also able to deal additional chip damage, which can be very helpful against an opposing Shedinja. Earth Power is a weaker alternative that is able to damage both Mega Gengar and Primal Groudon for more damage, as well as be able to damage Flash Fire Steel-type Pokemon; however, it would also leave Xerneas unable to damage Pokemon such as Celesteela.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature maximizes Speed and allows Xerneas to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Regigigas, Modest Mega Diancie, Timid Primal Kyogre, and positive Speed nature Primal Groudon. A Modest nature is an alternative that provides Xerneas with additional power, allowing it to nearly 2HKO Giratina unboosted. Poison Heal alongside a Toxic Orb is necessary, with Toxic Orb being the most efficient way to guarantee that Poison Heal will activate. Poison Heal is very important, as it makes Xerneas immune to sleep, allows it to beat a foe with Imposter by letting it recover while the foe cannot, and makes Xerneas very difficult to wear down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Before Toxic Orb has activated, Xerneas should be used very carefully, as if it does not get poisoned, it loses a great deal of use. An effective way to reliably activate it would be to use a slow Pokemon to pivot Xerneas in, as it will generally be able to safely activate the Orb. If Poison Heal has already been activated, Xerneas is able to provide a beneficial defensive role as a switch-in to Knock Off, as it will not take much damage or care about losing its item. It is also able to work well as a sponge to status effects and can often switch into both Giratina and Mega Audino safely. It is recommended to scout for Pokemon with Unaware, as they occasionally can run sets to nullify Poison Heal, by using moves such as Gastro Acid and Entrainment. Thanks to its passive recovery, good defensive typing, and good bulk, Xerneas is able to be an effective defensive Pokemon against threats such as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados. Additionally, Xerneas can also fill an offensive role by setting up against Pokemon that are unable to do much against it, such as defensive Yveltal and Mega Audino. However, Xerneas should be careful when facing defensive Steel-type pokemon, as they are often able to survive its attacks, and will occasionally run Flash Fire, and can threaten it with either STAB moves or moves such as Entrainment. Also, be wary of letting Xerneas's HP get too low, as this might leave it unable to effectively KO an Imposter Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Xerneas appreciates teammates such as Mega Mewtwo Y, which is able to handle faster Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, which could otherwise OHKO Xerneas. It also appreciates Xerneas's ability to break through its checks such as RegenVest Primal Kyogre in return. Xerneas also appreciates teammates that are able to remove opposing Steel-types or significantly weaken them, such as Mega Mewtwo X. Pokemon that appreciate Xerneas's resistance to Dark-type moves or Knock Off, such as Giratina and Mega Mewtwo Y, are also good options for teammates. An Imposter user can scout for Unaware, Flash Fire, or a move that is able to remove Poison Heal, such as Worry Seed, Gastro Acid, or Entrainment. A defensive Steel-type switch-in could be beneficial in case the opponent has their own Poison Heal Pokemon that Xerneas would be unable to defeat, such as Primal Kyogre or Regigigas. If Xerneas is using Spore, it appreciates having a teammate with Knock Off for removing opposing Pokemon's Safety Goggles for Xerneas.</p>"

  "Yveltal": {
    "overview": "<p>Yveltal is a versatile Pokemon thanks to its solid 126 / 95 / 98 bulk, mixed 131 / 131 offenses, and a useful Dark / Flying typing that let it perform various defensive roles on teams while not being passive. This typing grants it an immunity to Psychic, a resistance to Ghost, and a neutrality to Fighting, allowing it to serve as a check to offensive threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar. Fur Coat Yveltal can also serve as a check to certain Mega Mewtwo X sets, like Dazzling and Contrary, but it must be healthy in order to do so, while Unaware sets are good against setup sweepers due to Yveltal's immunity to Photon Geyser and Stored Power and resistance to Moongeist Beam and Power Trip. Its Flying typing also makes Yveltal immune to Spikes, which typically hinder other Dark-types. Its Dark typing is also useful for forcing out spinblockers like Giratina and Aegislash and for an immunity to Prankster status moves. The downside of Yveltal’s typing is its weaknesses to the common –ate ability wallbreakers like Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem-W as well as its weakness to Stealth Rock. Weaknesses to Fairy, Ice, and Electric also hurt Yveltal’s ability to check offensive threats with powerful coverage moves like Fleur Cannon, Moonblast, Ice Hammer, Ice Beam, and Bolt Strike. Yveltal needs to stay healthy throughout the battle in order to check the threats it needs to, and its Stealth Rock weaknesses makes it harder to stay healthy enough to do its job. While Yveltal's typing and common sets handle some dangerous offensive threats, there are still many potent offensive threats that beat it like Primal Groudon, Mega Diancie, Xerneas, Regigigas, and Sheer Force Mewtwo Mega Y with Bolt Strike.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Yveltal can run Poison Heal sets with similar movesets to have an alternative form of passive recovery. Beak Blast pairs nicely with this ability so Yveltal can go last to avoid Core Enforcer and cripple Imposter users when running Knock Off. Poison Heal isn't as effective as Yveltal's main sets, however, because it misses out on the added bulk from Assault Vest and the utility of Unaware, all while being susceptible to Toxic damage if the ability is lost. Yveltal can also play offense with Unburden + White Herb for an Imposter-proof setup sweeper with a powerful Power Trip that can overwhelm unsuspecting foes. This typically runs Shell Smash, Imprison, Power Trip, and Sunsteel Strike. The Unburden set is weak to priority attacks like –ate Extreme Speed, but Dazzling or Queenly Majesty can be used to block priority but sacrifice being self-Imposter proof. However, both sets are walled by Prankster Haze, which is a very common method of stopping setup sweepers. Regenerator sets can swap the Assault Vest for a Choice Scarf for a surprise fast Knock Off on Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar while forgoing the added special bulk. Choice Scarf sets drop Beak Blast and use Knock Off and can swap Spectral Thief for Trick. Dragon Ascent is also an option to surprise foes like Mega Sceptile or Mega Beedrill. However, this set is not as effective at playing a defensive role without the Assault Vest. Fur Coat is an option to better check Mega Mewtwo X and also hang with powerful physical attackers like Primal Groudon and Regigigas. However, this is a more niche option, as while Unaware sets are normally overpowered by these Pokemon, this set is not able to check as many threats as Unaware and RegenVest are. Furthermore, Fur Coat is still not the most reliable check to these threats, as Adaptability Mega Mewtwo X still threatens to 2HKO with chip damage and Primal Groudon can hit it with Fleur Cannon. Prankster is an option that has good role compression in that it checks setup sweepers and Mega Gengar. However, unlike common Steel-type Prankster users, this set is forced out by Mega Diancie and Xerneas and can end up giving up momentum versus threats that overpower it without boosts.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Yveltal is forced out by every viable Fairy-type, most commonly Mega Diancie, Xerneas, and Mega Audino. They resist Yveltal's most common STAB attacks and threaten to hit back with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>-ate Users</strong>: Yveltal is weak to every –ate user outside of Aerilate. Without an Assault Vest, -ate Boomburst is usually an OHKO, and without Fur Coat, Fake Out + Extreme Speed can KO Yveltal. While Yveltal isn't weak to Aerilate, it doesn't resist it and takes massive damage from Boomburst.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks</strong>: High-powered attacks like Mega Rayquaza's Choice Specs Aerilate Boomburst, Primal Groudon's V-create, and Poison Heal Regigigas's Facade hit Yveltal for massive damage. Strong, unresisted STAB moves and super effective moves can wear Yveltal down very quickly.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Shedinja</strong>: Yveltal is forced out by Sturdy Shedinja, as Shedinja can drop Yveltal down to 1 HP with Endeavor and stay in on Yveltal's attacks due to Sturdy. Most Shedinja also run Protective Pads, so keep this in mind when trying to burn it with Beak Blast.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Yveltal is weak to Stealth Rock and doesn’t like losing 25% when coming in to check setup threats. This damage adds up over the battle and can make a difference in Yveltal winning and losing a matchup.</p>",

      "Unaware Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spectral Thief steals any boosts the opposing Pokemon has prior to inflicting damage. This is great for Unaware sets, as the foe's boosts are ignored and can be stolen for Yveltal to take advantage of instead. Stolen Special Attack boosts can power up Revelation Dance so Yveltal can knock out the frailer offensive foes it might face, while stolen defensive boosts help it take big hits to handle offensive threats better. Revelation Dance is a powerful utility move that maintains a Dark typing even if Yveltal's ability has been replaced with Normalize by Entrainment Mega Gengar. It also forces out walls like Giratina, Aegislash, and Cresselia to help with spinning and gaining momentum and chip damage. This move is a must on the set and helps make Yveltal less passive. Shore Up is a great recovery move to keep Yveltal healthy and provides boosted healing while in sand. U-turn is a nice pivot move to bring out teammates and maintain momentum after forcing out setup sweepers like Mega Sceptile, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Primal Kyogre. Pursuit can be used to hit offensive threats like Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y for big damage if they switch out. It can also damage other walls that don't want to stay in on Yveltal like Giratina and Aegislash. This is useful chip damage that can prevent them from switching in against other attackers. Baneful Bunker is an option for scouting opponents’ moves while also punishing physical contact from common moves like U-turn and Fake Out by inflicting poison. Scouting with this can also help against Choice item users by making them reveal their selected move. Rapid Spin is another option if the team is in need of an entry hazard clearer. This pairs well with Revelation Dance, which forces out spinblockers like Giratina. However, Yveltal's susceptibility to being worn down by Stealth Rock makes it a less reliable hazard remover and also makes it more difficult to perform its job as a setup stop.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Safety Goggles keeps Yveltal safe from Spore and chip damage from weather. The Speed investment with a negative nature allows Yveltal to be slower than most offensive foes to steal boosts on the turn of boosting and also outspeed them the next turn. A Sassy nature is used for checking special threats like Triage Mega Rayquaza, Mega Sceptile, and Ultra Necrozma. Note that Sassy guarantees the survival of at least three hits from non-Life Orb Triage Mega Rayquaza but a neutral nature does not. A Relaxed nature is used to check physical threats better like Simple Shell Smash users and Poison Heal Mega Gyarados and to better take Secret Sword from Mega Gengar or Mega Mewtwo Y. Unaware lets Yveltal ignore opposing stat boosts so that it can stop potential setup sweepers like the ones mentioned above.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If the opposing Pokemon has boosted its defenses, such as with Contrary V-create or Superpower, Spectral Thief should be used to steal these boosts and aid Yveltal in checking the threat. This is even more effective because Yveltal ignores the threat's boosts while the threat doesn't ignore Yveltal's boosts. High health is important for Yveltal to perform its job, so recover when necessary and keep Stealth Rock off the field. Once the opponent realizes Yveltal is Unaware, they will likely stop boosting in order to wear down Yveltal with unboosted damage. Yveltal can generally hard switch into common Mega Gengar sets such as Normalize, Dazzling, and Adaptability as long as it is relatively healthy and force them out or KO them with Revelation Dance. However, Stealth Rock chip can hurt Yveltal's chances of walling Adaptability Mega Gengar with Poison STAB attacks or boosted Normalize Boomburst. Avoid attempting to stop setup sweepers like Xerneas, Kyurem-B, and Zekrom, as their super effective STAB attacks will overwhelm Yveltal. It is helpful to scout for coverage moves on Pokemon that may lure Yveltal, such as Pixilate Boomburst on Mega Mewtwo X, to prevent surprise KOs. In general, scout sets when possible, as certain Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y sets can hit Yveltal for big damage, like Adaptability with a Poison STAB attack or Sheer Force with Bolt Strike, respectively. Volt Switch from these threats or from Choice Specs users can also hit Yveltal really hard. Revelation Dance is a spammable move due to its high PP and solid Base Power as well as its ability to keep its typing through Normalize to nail Mega Gengar. If opposing Pokemon that resist Dark have been removed, Yveltal can put pressure on the opposing team due to this move's strength.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky Steel-types like Registeel and Solgaleo pair well with Yveltal, as they are able to take on the –ate Pokemon and Fairy- and Ice-types that give Yveltal trouble. Prankster users like Registeel, Aegislash, and Giratina are also welcome teammates, as they can deal with setup sweepers that can overpower Yveltal, like Regigigas, Primal Groudon, and Magic Guard Mega Diancie. Also, Yveltal will be able to easily switch in against Imposter users that have copied the Prankster teammate to gain momentum. Solid entry hazard removal or Magic Bounce support from Pokemon like Mega Audino and Giratina is appreciated so that Yveltal can switch in to check threats without losing 25% of its health. Setup sweepers that can’t overpower Yveltal are nice teammates, as Yveltal can help Imposter-proof them. Some examples include Contrary Mega Mewtwo Y with Pixie Plate Judgment and Triage Mega Rayquaza. More reliable checks to Mega Mewtwo X are appreciated, such as Mega Slowbro and Cresselia. Yveltal also covers their weakness to Ghost-types like Mega Gengar. Primal Groudon is a nice partner that can switch into many Primal Kyogre sets that try to overpower Yveltal with unresisted Water STAB attacks. In return, Yveltal can put pressure on Giratina so that it can't check Groudon as well. Imposter users are an option to scout for potentially dangerous coverage moves from threats like Mega Mewtwo Y or Mega Gengar. Defensive Fairy-types like Mega Audino and Magearna make nice teammates to check opposing Dark-types that can threaten Yveltal, like Diamond Storm Mega Tyranitar, as well as help take advantage of Imposter users that have copied Yveltal.</p>"

      "RegenVest Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Revelation Dance allows Yveltal to hit offensive threats like Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y and defensive walls like Giratina and Aegislash for super effective damage and is its most consistent damage option. It also gives Yveltal the ability to hit with Dark STAB even through Normalize. Spectral Thief steals any boosts the opponent has prior to attacking. This is great for defensive pivots to help force out Pokemon trying to set up such as Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y. Pursuit is useful for hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types like Mega Gengar or Cresselia that don't want to stay in on Yveltal. Nuzzle is an option to cripple Contrary users like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Sceptile as well as pester walls with the inability to move. Beak Blast is a powerful utility move for a secondary STAB option that usually hits last, so offensive threats can't come in safely, and burns Pokemon that make contact with Yveltal. This makes foes like Mega Mewtwo X and Registeel hesitant to use their STAB moves or pivot moves, respectively, in fear of a burn. However, this stops Yveltal from being able to U-turn on its Imposter users without being burned. Rapid Spin can be used if Yveltal is the team's primary method of entry hazard removal; while it gives up the momentum and utility that Beak Blast brings, it is a good move for Yveltal, as Revelation Dance forces out the Ghost-types that try to spinblock. Regenerator also somewhat mitigates Yveltal’s Stealth Rock weakness, making it more reliable for hazard clearing than other sets. Knock Off can be used to remove useful items but also makes Yveltal prone to losing its Assault Vest when facing Imposter users. This move is nice for hitting foes with poor Defense like Mega Mewtwo Y. U-turn is for pivoting out to bring in your teammates while also gaining momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest increases Yveltal’s special bulk and allows it to take hits from Pokemon like Shell Smash Mega Mewtwo Y and Poison Heal Primal Kyogre for less damage than normal. At full health, it can even survive Choice Specs Boomburst from Aerilate Mega Rayquaza and Fleur Cannon from Mega Mewtwo Y and pivot out. The downside of the Assault Vest is Yveltal can't run valuable status moves like recovery or Defog. A Sassy nature further increases Yveltal’s ability to take special attacks. For example, Sassy prevents Pixilate Boomburst from Pixie Plate Mega Diancie from OHKOing Yveltal, while Relaxed makes it fall 43.8% of the time. This important because Yveltal can stay in if absolutely necessary to chip Diancie with U-turn or hit it with Knock Off. Regenerator allows Yveltal to passively gain health when switching out to keep it healthy longer and make up for not running a recovery move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Yveltal can be sent in on special attackers like Mega Gengar and Ultra Necrozma to steal their boosts or remove their items and pivot out while regaining health. It is a good blanket check to most special attackers as long as they don’t have super effective STAB moves. Yveltal can also come in on most walls, especially Giratina, Aegislash, Solgaleo, and Mega Slowbro, force them out, and safely pivot out itself. Try to avoid slow Core Enforce users or other ability-removing moves like Entrainment, as not gaining 1/3 health on the switch could be detrimental. Beak Blast helps avoid the additional effects of Core Enforcer, so that can be used if needed. Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field if Yveltal isn’t the team's entry hazard clearer so that it doesn't take an extra 25% when switching into special threats. Beak Blast is a spammable move due to its high PP and ability to punish slow pivots using U-turn. However, it can be good sometimes to not reveal it until later, if you want to surprise a wall using U-turn with a burn. Avoid Knock Off or Trick users so that Yveltal's Assault Vest is not lost and it isn't crippled with a useless item. Avoid status if possible, as burns and poison chip at Yveltal's health quickly. Scouting for potential lure coverage moves with Imposter users and other teammates can help protect Yveltal from surprise KOs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even with increased special bulk, Yveltal doesn’t like to take –ate Boomburst from Diancie and Mega Rayquaza, and this makes Registeel and Solgaleo valuable partners. Magic Bounce users and entry hazard clearers like Mega Audino and Giratina help Yveltal by keeping Stealth Rock off its side of the field and relieving Yveltal of hazard removal duty. Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y make good offensive teammates, as Yveltal is immune to Psychic and Ground and resists Dark and Ghost. This allows Yveltal to force out Ghost or Psychic foes so that it can bring in Gengar and Mewtwo safely. Yveltal can also serve as the backup Imposter-proof to these sets, depending on the chosen coverage moves. Physically bulky teammates like Giratina and Zygarde-C are nice to switch into physical wallbreakers like Regigigas, Kartana, and Primal Groudon. Mega Mewtwo X checks like Slowbro or Giratina with great defensive bulk pair nicely as well, as they resist both of its STAB moves. Conversely, Mega Mewtwo X also makes a good teammate because Yveltal helps it deal with Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Gengar, and Giratina.</p>"

  "Zygarde-Complete": {
    "overview": "<p>Zygarde-C's excellent HP and Defense stats along with an excellent defensive typing allow it to function as a physical wall that checks threats such as Regigigas, Gyarados, and Primal Groudon. Due to its good mixed bulk, almost any defensive set on Zygarde-C is considered viable, and its low Speed allows it to go last against offensive threats and grant momentum to the player if it chooses to pivot. Also, its special bulk, while not as impressive as its physical bulk, is sufficient to check mixed attackers, though Zygarde-C will still have difficulty switching into them. Unfortunately, Zygarde-C's great presence in the metagame and its crippling 4x weakness to Ice mean that most of the Pokemon it traditionally checks now carry coverage for it, such as Primal Groudon and Mega Mewtwo X. Also, Zygarde-C is weak to Fairy and Dragon, two already very common offensive types, and it cannot take on strong mixed attackers or strong specially oriented Pokemon, such as Primal Kyogre and Mega Mewtwo Y. Because of all of this, Zygarde-C faces competition from Giratina as a defensive Dragon-type, which has an arguably better defensive typing that lets it switch into Shedinja, check defensive variants of Primal Kyogre, and check Fighting-types such as Mega Mewtwo X better thanks to an immunity to Close Combat. In addition to this, Giratina lacks a crippling 4x weakness to Ice. However, Zygarde-C's lower speed, higher physical bulk, and neutrality to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks give it a niche over Giratina, as these traits let it check Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados while also avoiding taking large amounts of damage from common utility moves such as Knock Off and Spectral Thief.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the Poison Heal set, Will-O-Wisp can be used to check physical threats better and scout for Magic Bounce. However, fitting it in can be difficult. Haze can also be used for the high PP, but Zygarde-C generally prefers the other two anti-setup moves because they punish setup, while Haze merely resets a situation that can otherwise be taken advantage of. A RegenVest set with U-turn, Spectral Thief, Core Enforcer, and Metal Burst can be used to take on special Pokemon better. However, this leaves Zygarde-C without a recovery option it can use while staying in, and most specially offensive Pokemon handle RegenVest Zygarde-C easily enough anyway. Zygarde-C can use a Prankster set with Haze, Recover, Destiny Bond, and Core Enforcer to handle setup sweepers better and gain more opportunities to recover health, as other sets generally have to take a hit before recovering health. A Soundproof set with Anchor Shot, Shore Up, Perish Song, and Parting Shot can be used to check -ate users, trap Imposter users, and trap and use Perish Song on Pokemon which cannot KO it. However, Zygarde-C can no longer reliably check the Pokemon it wishes to on its main sets, which is a large tradeoff. Alternatively, use Anchor Shot, Core Enforcer, Strength Sap, and Shore Up in order to more reliably handle -ate users. However, in matchups where the opponent is not using an -ate Pokemon, you may sorely miss the utility another set offers. In addition, Zygarde-C checks can pivot out on it with this set, and it can't put in as much work once the opponent has successfully scouted the set. Magic Bounce can be run over Fur Coat or Unaware in order to take on support Pokemon better as well as bounce back utility moves on offensive Pokemon such as Spore, Leech Seed, and Will-O-Wisp. It notably bounces off Entrainment from Normalize Mega Gengar, allowing Zygarde-C to check it. However, Magic Bounce Zygarde-C isn't able to reliably check most of the offensive Pokemon Zygarde-C typically can. An offensive Poison Heal set with Shift Gear, Thousand Arrows, Knock Off, and Will-O-Wisp can be used to take advantage of Zygarde-C's great bulk, good offensive typing, and decent Attack stat. However, Zygarde-C is outclassed by Mega Garchomp in this role as well as by almost every other Poison Heal sweeper due to their greater offenses, so a defensive role is preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>-ate users</strong>: Kyurem-B and Mega Diancie can both easily beat Zygarde-C with their STAB Boomburst attacks. However, they must be wary of Soundproof or RegenVest variants, as both sets either negate or survive Boomburst. Soundproof sets can retaliate with a trapping move, while RegenVest sets can KO with Metal Burst.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Surprise Ice-type coverage can OHKO Zygarde-C and can open up a weakness to Pokemon Zygarde-C was meant to check, making it important to scout for Ice-type coverage before switching Zygarde-C into offensive foes. Pokemon that may use Ice-type coverage and lure in and KO Zygarde-C include Avalanche Regigigas, Ice Hammer Mega Blaziken, and Refrigerate Mega Mewtwo X.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Zekrom, Mega Garchomp, and Giratina can do plenty of damage to Zygarde-C with their STAB moves. However, they must be wary of RegenVest variants, as these can 2HKO or OHKO them with Metal Burst.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: As most special wallbreakers carry Dragon-, Fairy-, or Ice-type coverage on all their sets, they often force Zygarde-C out due to its weaknesses and average special bulk. Examples include Primal Kyogre, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mega Sceptile.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Xerneas and Mega Audino force Zygarde-C out reliably, as it generally cannot do anything to them. Similarly, the aforementioned Mega Diancie can force out Zygarde-C, but must be carful to switch in if Thousand Waves has been revealed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Poison Heal": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Core Enforcer allows Zygarde-C to deal a decent amount of damage to most Pokemon due to its STAB bonus and respectable Base Power and also has the benefit of suppressing opposing abilities. Worry Seed can be used to remove abilities on slower Pokemon and Fairy-types, such as Mega Audino, Mega Gyarados, and Xerneas. In addition, it is able to replace Normalize Mega Gengar's ability even after it uses Entrainment. However, Zygarde-C is very slow and will not check Fairy-types anyway, so it prefers Core Enforcer. Spectral Thief is used to steal boosts from Pokemon that use setup, such as Primal Groudon and Mega Tyranitar. Topsy-Turvy is an alternative to Spectral Thief to check setup sweepers because even though it doesn't deal any damage, it has more PP, which is useful for PP stalling foes, and it allows Zygarde-C to check Normal-type sweepers like Regigigas and Arceus. Haze bypasses Magic Bounce setup, as well as having the most PP out of any setup-removing attack. However, Magic Bounce setup is relatively uncommon, so Spectral Thief or Topsy-Turvy is preferred.Thousand Waves traps foes that Zygarde-C checks, such as Regigigas, Primal Groudon, and Mega Tyranitar, pressures Steel-types such as Registeel as a respectable Base Power move boosted by STAB, and can be used to help gain momentum.</p> <p>U-turn allows Zygarde-C to gain momentum against faster foes by bringing in either more powerful wallbreakers or an Imposter user, which can be used to scout the foe's set. Defog removes entry hazards for teammates, letting them come in more safely. Spiky Shield can be used to help Zygarde-C activate its Toxic Orb and scout for coverage and Choice-locked moves; additionally, when Spiky Shield is used in tandem with Wish, it grants Zygarde-C a guaranteed form of recovery. Shore Up gives Zygarde-C the longevity it needs in order to consistently check the Pokemon it wishes to. Due to Zygarde-C's large HP stat, Wish can be used over Shore Up to trade access to instant recovery for the ability to heal teammates immensely. Volt Switch can be used exclusively with Thousand Waves in order to prevent Imposter Pokemon from coming in freely on Zygarde-C while still giving Zygarde-C the ability to pivot in some cases. However, using Volt Switch means Zygarde-C cannot pivot on opposing Ground-types such as Primal Groudon, Mega Steelix, and opposing Zygarde-C.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Relaxed nature maximizes Zygarde's physical bulk and, in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs and EVs, minimizes its Speed. This is incredibly important because going last is often beneficial, letting Zygarde-C remove as many abilities as possible with Core Enforcer, steal the stat boosts of slow Pokemon, and grant more momentum to the team with U-turn. A Toxic Orb in conjunction with Poison Heal grants Zygarde reliable passive recovery, healing 12% per turn. In addition, being poisoned allows Zygarde-C to come in on moves that inflict status conditions such as Spore, Poison Fang, Glare, and Will-O-Wisp. It can also come in on Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Play Zygarde-C carefully. While its bulk is great, its weaknesses are common, and it may be left unable to check Pokemon such as Regigigas and Mega Tyranitar later on in the battle. Pokemon that may lure in Zygarde and hit it with coverage include Mega Blaziken, Mega Mewtwo X, and Primal Groudon. If you're running Topsy-Turvy, be wary of Taunt and Magic Bounce users, as both hinder Zygarde-C's ability to effectively operate as a physical wall. Don't use Wish liberally early on in the game, as the recovery on offensive Pokemon can be crucial later on in the game. Rely on Poison Heal for recovery and only use Wish when you are required to. While passing Wishes to defensive Pokemon isn't a bad idea, Zygarde-C enjoys passing Wishes to offensive Pokemon in order to keep them healthy throughout the course of the battle. This also lets you play your offensive Pokemon more aggressively, allowing you to switch them into entry hazards more often. Whenever Zygarde-C is against a Pokemon faster than it that cannot OHKO it, you may pivot to another Pokemon for momentum. If you predict setup, however, you may use Spectral Thief, Topsy-Turvy, or Haze.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Imposter can be very useful for scouting surprise coverage that may hit Zygarde-C. Steel-types such as Registeel, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn can be useful for checking -ate Pokemon that may give Zygarde-C trouble while also checking Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks. In return, Zygarde-C can come in on most Fire-type attacks, which Steel-types cannot take. Strong wallbreakers such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Gyarados, and Primal Groudon can be used to break the opposing team while being Imposter-proofed by Zygarde-C. Zygarde-C can also use its low Speed to bring the offensive Pokemon of choice in safely as well as provide Wish support. Special walls such as Ho-Oh, RegenVest Mega Gyarados, and Fur Coat Chansey can take on specially biased offensive threats that give Zygarde-C trouble such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Diancie, and Primal Kyogre.</p>"
      },
      "Physical Setup Check": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shore Up grants Zygarde-C reliable recovery, allowing it to stay healthy throughout the battle. Core Enforcer gives Zygarde-C a consistent option to deal damage while also temporarily suppressing the ability of any faster Pokemon. This allows it to discourage Regigigas, Mega Mewtwo X, and other Pokemon that don't beat Zygarde-C from staying in on it by removing abilities such as Poison Heal. Entrainment can be used to remove abilities from Fairy-types, Normalize Mega Gengar, and Sturdy Shedinja but it is generally not preferred, as Zygarde-C cannot take on most Fairy-types in the metagame anyway. Stealth Rock can be used to set entry hazards to help your other Pokemon wallbreak and sweep. However, the opportunity cost of running it over a move that removes abilities is high, and the risk that it is reflected is high considering common Magic Bounce Pokemon such as Mega Audino enjoy switching into Zygarde-C. Defog can be used to remove entry hazards for opposing teammates. However, again, Zygarde-C prefers having a move that removes abilities, as it can deal with the Pokemon it wishes to check better than if it were running Defog.</p> <p>Topsy-Turvy can be used to reverse the stat boosts of Pokemon, allowing Zygarde-C to take on opposing setup Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Mega Tyranitar. Spectral Thief can be used on in order to steal stat boosts, potentially stealing defensive stat boosts as well, making Zygarde-C even bulkier. However, it cannot take on Normal-type setup sweepers such as Regigigas and Arceus well. Thousand Waves prevents most Pokemon from switching, letting Zygarde-C trap Imposter Pokemon and other Pokemon it wishes to check while also granting momentum if it traps a Pokemon it wishes to switch out against. U-turn can be used to attain momentum on foes, but it comes with the consequence of Zygarde-C not being self-Imposter proof as well as foregoing the utility of Thousand Waves. In addition, without Thousand Waves, Regigigas can put Zygarde-C to sleep and switch out, which can be dangerous in the long run.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fur Coat allows Zygarde-C to blanket check physical attackers such as Mega Tyranitar, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Gyarados. Alternatively, Unaware allows it to blanket check setup sweepers such as Regigigas, Primal Groudon, and Arceus. Safety Goggles blocks Spore, allowing Zygarde-C to switch in on Pokemon it checks such as Regigigas and Mega Tyranitar without being discouraged by sleep. Leftovers can also be used, as it grants passive recovery, while Rocky Helmet can be used to attain chip damage on contact attacks. However, Zygarde-C prefers the Spore immunity. Groundium Z can provide a one-time nuke as well as a way to check Normalize Mega Gengar, as the Z-Move is unaffected by Entrainment + Normalize. However, it can be hard to justify Groundium Z over the other item options, and Zygarde-C is also an unreliable Mega Gengar check, as it can only use Tectonic Rage once, and Judgment hurts even if Zygarde-C is running Unaware. A Relaxed nature in conjunction with 0 Speed EVs and IVs lets Zygarde-C fully handle setup Pokemon it wishes to check.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure to scout for Ice-type coverage on Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar before switching in Zygarde-C. While its bulk is great, you should always check to see if Pokemon it checks, such as Regigigas, Primal Groudon, and Mega Blaziken, are currently alive before trying to take advantage of its great bulk to check other threats. When using Stealth Rock, be sure to scout for Magic Bounce on Pokemon such as Mega Audino before using it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Imposter Pokemon such as Chansey can be used to scout for coverage that may threaten Zygarde-C. Pokemon that check -ate users such as Flash Fire Steel-types and Soundproof Mega Slowbro are appreciated, as Zygarde-C cannot take them on. Most physical wallbreakers pair well with Zygarde-C, as it Imposter-proofs them while they can break the opposing team. Primal Groudon can be used as a setup sweeper that is also Imposter-proofed by Zygarde-C. RegenVest Primal Kyogre is appreciated as a teammate, as it takes on the special Pokemon that Zygarde-C cannot take on. Magic Bounce Pokemon such as Mega Audino and Cresselia can Imposter-proof Zygarde-C due to their low Speed, great bulk, and typing. They can also take on threats Zygarde-C cannot handle, such as Xerneas and Mega Mewtwo Y.</p>"

  "Diancie-Mega": {
    "overview": "<p>A combination of power and versatility makes Mega Diancie difficult to counter. Its great mixed offenses and Rock / Fairy typing give it a strong niche as a revenge killer and wallbreaker with Pixilate. Meanwhile, its Magic Guard set, which can 2HKO all Pokemon in the metagame depending on its chosen moves, can also sweep if it carries Shell Smash. Also worth noting is Mega Diancie's ability to set entry hazards even against teams carrying Magic Bounce thanks to its offensive pressure. Mega Diancie's typing is also fairly good defensively thanks to its resistances to common attacking types like Dragon, Bug, Dark, and Flying, allowing it to counter defensive Pokemon like Giratina thanks to its immunity to Core Enforcer and giving it many opportunities to switch in and break down walls. Mega Diancie can also take advantage of common Dark- and Dragon-types, most of which are OHKOed by its Pixilate Boomburst or Magic Guard Light of Ruin, to switch in and immediately pose a huge offensive threat. However, while Mega Diancie has good enough bulk to take relatively weak or resisted moves like Yveltal's Revelation Dance and Giratina's Spectral Thief, it can't switch in on strong moves like Mega Mewtwo Y's Psychic and Choice Band Mega Mewtwo X's Close Combat. Also, it is worth noting that Mega Diancie's bulk is mostly in its 110/110 defenses. This gives it a poor matchup against Imposter Chansey, because while Mega Diancie is held back by its low base HP, Chansey has massive 250/110/110 defenses when Transformed into it. Furthermore, because Pixilate Mega Diancie is a common threat, Pokemon like Steel-types, Red Orb Groudon, and Ho-Oh are found on most teams, making it harder for Mega Diancie to break through opposing teams depending on the moves it carries.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb Sheer Force Mega Diancie with Diamond Storm, Moonblast, Earth Power, and Blue Flare is a decent wallbreaker, but it is somewhat outclassed by Sheer Force Mega Mewtwo Y and Magic Guard Mega Diancie. Poison Heal Mega Diancie can act as a decent sweeper with a set of Moonblast, Earth Power, Quiver Dance, and either Spore or Lovely Kiss. It's less passive than other Poison Heal users such as Xerneas, but its frailty and 4x weakness to Steel make it overreliant on sleep turns to beat Pokemon like Solgaleo. Choice Specs Pixilate Mega Diancie is effective at breaking defensive teams thanks to the added power that lets it overcome its usual switch-ins like Fur Coat Chansey, but it loses out on the utility of Extreme Speed. Pixilate Mega Diancie can use many niche but viable options like Recover, Thousand Arrows or Thousand Waves + Groundium Z, Lovely Kiss, Shell Smash, and Endeavor. These require it to forgo more viable options, though. A nature that boosts Attack or Special Attack, like Mild, can be used on Pixilate Mega Diancie; however, this causes it to be outsped by foes like Jolly Poison Heal Regigigas and Kartana.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flash Fire Pokemon</strong>: Most Mega Diancie sets rely on Fire-type coverage, so Pokemon that carry Flash Fire can counter them. Examples include Aegislash, Solgaleo, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Dazzling Users</strong>: Dazzling users like Mega Mewtwo Y can surprise Pixilate Mega Diancie with an immunity to its Extreme Speed and take advantage of the free turn to set up or KO it. Focus Sash Magic Guard variants can prevent them from setting up, though.</p> <p><strong>Soundproof</strong>: Soundproof users like Mega Audino are immune to Pixilate Mega Diancie's Boomburst, preventing it from 2HKOing them. However, Magic Guard sets are threatening to these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Imposter Users</strong>: Imposter Chansey can switch in on Mega Diancie without taking much damage and force it out, while Imposter Pikachu can't switch in but can threaten to OHKO Mega Diancie and 2HKO Pokemon used to Imposter-proof it.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Shedinja</strong>: Mega Diancie rarely uses Sunsteel Strike, so Sturdy Shedinja can counter most sets. However, Stealth Rock can pressure Shedinja teams.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pokemon like Red Orb Groudon and Magic Guard Ho-Oh make good Boomburst switch-ins. However, Groudon is weak to Ground-type coverage, and Ho-Oh is OHKOed by Magic Guard Head Smash.</p>",

      "Pixilate Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pixilate Extreme Speed allows Mega Diancie to pick off fast, frail foes including Mega Mewtwo X, Zekrom, and Shell Smash users like Mega Tyranitar. Boomburst is Mega Diancie's strongest move, 2HKOing defensive Pokemon like Mega Audino and Cresselia and OHKOing frail Pokemon or those hit super effectively like Yveltal and opposing Mega Diancie. V-create is used as coverage for the myriad of Steel-types in the metagame such as Registeel, Solgaleo, and Celesteela. Thanks to its extremely high Base Power, it can outright KO these Pokemon after minimal prior damage. However, it has poor offensive synergy with Boomburst outside of hitting Steel-types, and it fails to hit Flash Fire Steel-types as well as Fire-types like Ho-Oh and Red Orb Groudon. Precipice Blades hits Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types super effectively, giving it better coverage than V-create, but it comes with a notable power decrease. It also leaves Mega Diancie walled by Celesteela. Fake Out deals a decent amount of chip damage to offensive Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Gengar, allowing Mega Diancie to easily wear them down into Extreme Speed range. Stealth Rock deals damage to opposing Pokemon as they switch in. It helps pressure defensive Pokemon that would otherwise wall Mega Diancie, such as Fur Coat Chansey and Ho-Oh lacking Magic Guard, and thanks to the threat of super effective STAB Boomburst it deters common Magic Bounce users like Giratina from switching in so Mega Diancie can reliably set up Stealth Rock in most matchups. Sunsteel Strike deals tons of damage to Imposter users on the switch and also lets Mega Diancie lure and OHKO Sturdy Shedinja. It provides no coverage against Pokemon that resist Boomburst, though. Other options like Rapid Spin, which cannot be blocked thanks to Pixilate, and Explosion, which enables Mega Diancie to overcome resistant Pokemon such as Steel-types at the cost of sacrificing itself, are viable, but Mega Diancie usually doesn't have the space to run them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature is used to preserve Mega Diancie's valuable Speed tier without lowering the power of Extreme Speed or Boomburst or making Mega Diancie more susceptible to common physical attacks such as Knock Off, Spectral Thief, and U-turn. Hasty can be used instead to take less damage from special attacks like boosted Oblivion Wing from Triage Mega Charizard Y. Pixie Plate gives Mega Diancie's Fairy-type attacks a notable 1.2x boost. This helps Boomburst OHKO Giratina and opposing Naive Mega Diancie. Life Orb variants of Pixilate Mega Diancie are worn down very easily, but in return they have the most power, OHKOing some less bulky Steel-types like Magearna and RegenVest Celesteela with V-create. Leftovers increases Mega Diancie's longevity and gives it free recovery when brought in on a slow pivot move. It is notably weaker than other variants, though.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unlike other offensive Pokemon, Mega Diancie can be directly switched in on foes like Giratina. However, variants without Fake Out risk losing momentum if these Pokemon pivot out on the switch. Don't be afraid to make aggressive plays with Mega Diancie if needed, such as using Precipice Blades or Stealth Rock against an opposing Giratina predicting it to switch out. Even if you mispredict, Mega Diancie won't take much damage from any attack. At the same time, playing too recklessly against defensive teams can cause Mega Diancie to be lured and KOed by Pokemon like Soundproof Thousand Waves Zygarde-C and Flash Fire Anchor Shot Registeel. Don't be too hasty in using Mega Diancie's priority attacks against Pokemon like Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo X, because these Pokemon could carry Dazzling and set up on Mega Diancie. Make sure to use Extreme Speed against opposing Pokemon at low HP that might carry Prankster Destiny Bond. Extreme Speed outprioritizes the move, so Mega Diancie will not faint to Destiny Bond if it KOes the foe first.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Imposter users like Choice Scarf Chansey can scout for sets that could give Mega Diancie trouble, like Soundproof and Flash Fire, and serve as a secondary revenge killer. Prankster Haze users like Registeel, Cresselia, and Giratina help Mega Diancie against setup Pokemon that utilize Dazzling or Queenly Majesty alongside a boosting move, like Shell Smash Mega Gengar. In return, Mega Diancie can revenge kill dangerous Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Garchomp, and Mega Sceptile with Extreme Speed. Alternatively, Unaware users like Zygarde-C can handle most +2 Dazzling users, and RegenVest Primal Kyogre can take strong special attacks. Pokemon like Magic Bounce Celesteela, Moonlight Red Orb Groudon, and Fur Coat Chansey can Imposter-proof Mega Diancie depending on the moves chosen, preventing opposing Imposter users from breaking down the team should they happen to transform into Mega Diancie. Red Orb Groudon in particular forms a powerful offensive core with Mega Diancie, because it can take advantage of the Steel- and Fire-types Mega Diancie forces in. In return, Mega Diancie's Boomburst deals massive damage to Giratina and Zygarde-C, the main switch-ins to Red Orb Groudon. Entry hazard removers like Mega Audino and Giratina prevent Mega Diancie from being worn down from repeated switches. Entry hazard setters like Poison Heal Mega Mewtwo X can help wear down switch-ins to Mega Diancie and prevent Sturdy Shedinja from countering it.</p>"
      },
      "Magic Guard": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Smash is Mega Diancie's strongest attack. It deals lots of damage to special walls like Primal Kyogre, Flash Fire Celesteela, and Chansey, and it OHKOes Ho-Oh. Light of Ruin is used to damage Dragon-types like Zygarde-C, and also hits Dark-types super effectively. Its high power and decent accuracy make it Magic Guard Mega Diancie's most reliable attack. Flare Blitz provides coverage against Steel-types. Unlike Mind Blown, it inflicts physical damage, so it allows Mega Diancie to OHKO Assault Vest users like Solgaleo and Registeel at +2. Mind Blown has a higher base power than Flare Blitz, so it pressures Pokemon like Prankster Registeel more effectively. Shell Smash boosts Mega Diancie's attacking stats and Speed by 2 stages in a single turn, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO almost every Pokemon. Focus Sash allows it to set up against faster foes that could otherwise OHKO it. Spectral Thief combined with Focus Sash allows Mega Diancie to act as an emergency check to almost any sweeper even with entry hazards up, thanks to Magic Guard protecting it from indirect damage. Defog variants of Mega Diancie can't sweep, but they can offensively pressure nearly every entry hazard setter. In a pinch, Mega Diancie can use its Focus Sash to reliably remove entry hazards, preserving its teammates' Focus Sashes and making it a good asset on hyper offense. Sunsteel Strike can be used on offensive teams to eliminate Imposter Chansey and Sturdy Shedinja.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Lonely or Mild can be used depending on whether Flare Blitz or Mind Blown is chosen. The Defense drop allows Mega Diancie to deal more damage to Imposter users with Head Smash or Sunsteel Strike. Life Orb gives Mega Diancie a 30% power boost to all its attacks, and it has no drawbacks because Magic Guard prevents the recoil. Focus Sash is better on offensive support variants of Mega Diancie, because such sets value the ability to survive any one hit more than the 30% power boost from Life Orb. Magic Guard nullifies the recoil on Mega Diancie's attacks, allowing it to freely use high-powered moves without their normal drawbacks. It also protects it from residual damage caused by entry hazards or status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unlike Pixilate variants, Shell Smash Magic Guard Mega Diancie must be played very carefully. Status like burn or paralysis can completely neutralize it by preventing it from breaking down or outspeeding foes, and it takes massive damage if the opposing Pokemon uses Spectral Thief as it sets up. Additionally, Mega Diancie fails to check faster Pokemon like Mega Sceptile if its Focus Sash is broken. That being said, it isn't that hard to find setup opportunities for Mega Diancie. Pokemon it forces out, like Yveltal and Giratina, are common. Additionally, it can bluff the much more common Pixilate set to force out foes like Mega Mewtwo X and then set up on the switch. Try to keep the opponent guessing as to what set Mega Diancie is, because if they believe it's a standard Pixilate variant, they will have no incentive to stay in, giving Mega Diancie the chance it needs to set up. Additionally, it can potentially lure in special walls like RegenVest Primal Kyogre and OHKO them with +2 Head Smash. Spectral Thief Mega Diancie should almost never be directly switched in against an offensive team; instead, its Focus Sash should be preserved until it is needed. If Mega Diancie's value as an emergency check or late-game sweeper is not needed, it can act as an early-game wallbreaker instead. Defog Mega Diancie can potentially be switched in against any defensive Pokemon that doesn't immediately threaten to KO it if need be. Against offensive teams, it shouldn't be needlessly switched in because it could potentially be 2HKOed through its Focus Sash on the switch; however, if needed it can remove entry hazards by bluffing Pixilate Extreme Speed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Flash Fire Steel-types like Topsy-Turvy Registeel can Imposter-proof Mega Diancie on balance teams. On offense teams, less consistent Pokemon including niche Unaware users and Prankster Destiny Bond users can prevent opposing Chansey from sweeping. Imposter users like Chansey and Pikachu can scout sets and serve as late-game sweepers once Mega Diancie has removed Imposter-proofers. Magic Bounce Mega Tyranitar can take on Normalize Mega Gengar and Poison Heal Regigigas, which are immune to Spectral Thief. Focus Sash Shell Smash users like Dazzling Mega Tyranitar can take advantage of the entry hazard removal provided by Defog Mega Diancie. Entry hazard setters like Magic Guard Mega Mewtwo Y, Red Orb Groudon, and suicide leads can deter Sturdy Shedinja.</p>"

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<p>Celesteela has an excellent defensive typing, letting it wall Pokemon such as Xerneas, Mega Diancie, and Primal Groudon when using a Primordial Sea set. An immunity to Ground means it can function as an excellent entry hazard remover due to it only being damaged by Stealth Rock. In addition, in conjunction with Primordial Sea, Celesteela can sport simultaneous immunities to Fire- and Ground-type attacks, which are the most common coverage moves used to defeat Steel-types. It has competition from other Steel-types, such as Registeel and Ferrothorn, but has the niche of not requiring an ability to be immune to Ground. Its typing also allows it to check Kartana as well as Mega Garchomp, two Pokemon that may be difficult to defensively check otherwise.</p> <p>However, while Celesteela's bulk is decent, it is not spectacular for a wall, so it finds difficulty in taking strong neutral attacks such as from Primal Kyogre and Mega Gyarados. In addition, it even struggles to take some resisted attacks such as Steelworker Kartana's Sunsteel Strike. A weakness to Electric means it does not like switching in on most specially-oriented wallbreakers, as they tend to use Volt Switch. The lack of a Rock-type resistance also means that Celesteela faces difficulty taking on Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar and Magic Guard Mega Diancie. Celesteela is very reliant on using Primordial Sea to carve a good niche in the metagame, meaning it does not have much freedom in what it runs, as other sets are done better by the previously mentioned Steel-types. Due to its reliance on Primordial Sea, it finds difficulty in checking offensive Water-types in the tier such as Primal Kyogre, Palkia, and Ash-Greninja. While it can run Flash Fire to somewhat remedy this weakness to Water-types, Celesteela is not made to check the listed Water-types anyways, so there isn't much benefit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flash Fire can be run over Primordial Sea to have an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, take reduced damage from Water-type attacks, and avoid giving away Celesteela's ability to the opponent. However, Flash Fire is bypassed by Mold Breaker, does not let Celesteela use Scald on Primal Groudon, and still does not let Celesteela check offensive Water-types such as Primal Kyogre, Mega Gyarados, and Palkia, making Primordial Sea the better option. A Magic Bounce set with Entrainment, Shore Up, Topsy-Turvy, and Anchor Shot can be used in order to better check Pokemon that use sleep such as Regigigas and Xerneas lacking Fire-type coverage. A Prankster set with Destiny Bond, Shore Up, Haze, and U-turn or Anchor Shot can be used in order to blanket check setup Pokemon. However, this set is passive and cannot threaten Pokemon except with Destiny Bond. It is also outclassed by Registeel and Aegislash. A RegenVest set with Beak Blast, Spectral Thief, Rapid Spin, and Core Enforcer or Revelation Dance can be used to better take on special Pokemon as well as better Imposter-proof Mega Diancie lacking Fire-type coverage. However, the loss of a Fire immunity is not appreciated, and not being able to recover without switching out can be an inconvenience at times. Volt Absorb can be used to beat Electric-type Pokemon that may wish to capitalize on Celesteela's Electric-type weakness. However, Electric-type users are uncommon, and a Volt Absorb set will lose to the very common V-create, making it difficult to justify using this set. Safety Goggles lets Celesteela block Spore, allowing it to switch in on Pokemon that use Spore without fear of being put to sleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Neutral Attacks</strong>: Kyurem-B and Mega Mewtwo X can all overwhelm Celesteela with their STAB attacks due to its low bulk. However, the two must be wary of a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Surprise Coverage</strong>: Coverage on Pokemon that Celesteela is supposed to check can surprise Celesteela and cripple it for the rest of the game. For this reason, it is important to scout the opponent's sets. Surprise coverage can include Bolt Strike, Volt Switch, and the aforementioned strong neutral attacks. These attacks can come from Pokemon such as Mega Diancie and Primal Groudon.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Regardless of if it is using RegenVest or Poison Heal, Primal Kyogre can threaten Celesteela thanks to Primal Kyogre's high Special Attack stat, its typing, and Celesteela's usage of Primordial Sea.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: As Celesteela has low offensive stats, it cannot do much to force opposing defensive Pokemon such as Giratina and Ferrothorn out aside from attempting to burn them with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Shedinja</strong>: Celesteela does not run moves to threaten Shedinja. Because of this, Shedinja can threaten Celesteela with Endeavor and then Extreme Speed unless Celesteela gets a burn from Scald or Beak Blast.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zekrom, Xurkitree, and Mega Ampharos can all eliminate Celesteela with their STAB Electric-type attacks while also being able to switch into Celesteela's Steel- and Flying-type attacks. However, Zekrom must be wary of switching into Scald for fear of being burned.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Primordial Sea": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shore Up gives Celesteela the longevity it needs in order to consistently check the Pokemon it wishes to. Scald allows Celesteela to force Primal Groudon out, threatening heavy damage in rain. It can also be used to try burning opposing Pokemon, halving their physical damage output and putting them on a timer. A burn can also inconvenience defensive Pokemon, forcing them to heal more often, and cripple Poison Heal Pokemon if their Toxic Orb has not activated. Beak Blast functions as a Flying STAB attack that allows Celesteela to burn Pokemon that make contact with it, such as Mega Mewtwo X. In addition to this, it allows Celesteela to punish slow pivoting by burning a Pokemon that may wish to use U-turn on it and damaging the switch-in of choice. However, the burn is predictable, and it does not let Celesteela check Primal Groudon as well. Topsy-Turvy allows Celesteela to check Pokemon such as Xerneas, Contrary Mega Mewtwo Y, and Regigigas. Spectral Thief can be used instead order to steal the foe's boosts, but this makes Celesteela unable to check Regigigas well, and it may make Imposter Pokemon difficult to check in some scenarios. However, it does have the advantage of hitting certain Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y super effectively, not being blocked by Taunt, and bypassing Substitutes, making it a nice option to consider.</p> <p>Defog is used to remove entry hazards, benefiting Celesteela's teammates that may dislike them. Defog is used over Rapid Spin, as Celesteela finds it hard to sufficiently damage Giratina and therefore cannot use Rapid Spin without risking Giratina coming in easily. However, if entry hazard removal is taken on by teammates, Anchor Shot can be used to trap Imposter users. It also functions well with Spectral Thief, enabling Celesteela to trap sweepers and consistently steal their boosts while also damaging them, eventually defeating them. Anchor Shot can also help trap Poison Heal Mega Audino, Xerneas, and Mega Diancie while also functioning as a strong Steel-type STAB move in general. However, given that the four moves on the set are vital and Celesteela risks being burned by Scald if it traps its own Imposter, it is difficult to justify running Anchor Shot on the set. Finally, U-turn can be used to grant momentum to the team, but it is also difficult to fit in. Entrainment can also be used instead of Defog to remove abilities from -ate users and Poison Heal sweepers. In conjunction with Anchor Shot, Celesteela can use Entrainment to trap and defeat Poison Heal sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Primordial Sea allows Celesteela to prevent Pokemon from using Fire-type moves. It is preferred over Flash Fire because it boosts the power of Celesteela's Scald and allows Celesteela to use Scald on Primal Groudon. However, it makes Celesteela take increased damage from Water-type moves, which may inconvenience it in emergency situations and gives it a worse matchup versus RegenVest Primal Kyogre. 0 Speed IVs in conjunction with a Sassy nature lets Celesteela underspeed as many Pokemon as possible. This allows Celesteela to check slow setup Pokemon in addition to other setup Pokemon. Leftovers provides passive recovery, reducing Celesteela's need to use Shore Up. Waterium Z provides an immunity to Trick as well as decreased damage from Knock Off. It also provides a way to OHKO Primal Groudon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure you know a Pokemon's full set before switching Celesteela on it. Celesteela does not take coverage well due to its average bulk, so while coverage is rare, it is vital to make sure that Celesteela can fully check Pokemon it is supposed to such as Mega Diancie. Otherwise, you risk losing Celesteela. If you are Primordial Sea and the opponent has a Primal Groudon, ensure you play Celesteela as carefully as possible. If you do not, Primal Groudon can come in on Celesteela and force it out. Flash Fire sets do not face this difficulty, so you can switch in Celesteela more liberally if it is Flash Fire and the opponent's Primal Groudon is currently healthy. Scout for moves that cause burns such as Will-O-Wisp. While Celesteela does not mind most forms of status, it dislikes being burned, as it makes it easier for it to get worn down. Make sure you exclusively bring Celesteela in on Pokemon it can wall, as it is important for Celesteela to stay healthy, and staying in on Pokemon Celesteela does not wall can cause it to be unable to check the Pokemon it wishes to later on in the game, such as Regigigas and Mega Diancie. If you do not need to use a specific move, Scald can be used liberally to try to get burns on the opponent's Pokemon. Against slow pivots, Beak Blast can be used to burn the pivoting Pokemon as well as deal damage to the Pokemon that is brought in. This allows Celesteela to discourage slow pivoting. Make sure Primal Groudon does not have Bolt Strike as coverage, as otherwise Celesteela will be KOed. Celesteela cannot switch into Regenerator Pokemon like other Steel-types can, as it is extremely vulnerable to chip damage and should avoid taking as much unnecessary damage as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primal Groudon is a potent sweeper that can be Imposter-proofed by Celesteela. In return, Primal Groudon can also threaten Celesteela thanks to Desolate Land blocking Scald in conjunction with boosting V-create's power. Wallbreakers such as Mega Diancie appreciate Celesteela's immunity to Fire- and Ground-type coverage, which allows them to freely run coverage attacks against other Steel-types without fear of Imposter. Celesteela's unique typing allows it to Imposter-proof wallbreakers, such as Mega Garchomp and Kartana, which would normally be difficult to Imposter-proof. Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, and Mega Steelix can check the Electric-types that give Celesteela trouble. Pokemon that check Mega Mewtwo X such as Mega Sableye, Cresselia, and Mega Slowbro can form a defensive core with Celesteela, as Celesteela deals with their offensive checks as well. For example, Giratina is an excellent partner due to checking Mega Mewtwo X and Electric-types. Imposter is also a good team option, as it allows you to scout for surprise coverage that may potentially make Celesteela unable to check a Pokemon. Extra entry hazard control is appreciated, as Celesteela is not a reliable Defogger. Magic Bounce Pokemon or Pokemon that use Defog can fulfill this role, such as Mega Audino and Giratina. If Celesteela does not have Topsy-Turvy, Regigigas checks such as Mega Tyranitar, Poison Heal Zygarde-C, and Dialga are necessary. Using Celesteela as your primary -ate check leaves it vulnerable to -ate sets that hold Choice Specs, as well as Kyurem-B. For this reason, it is recommended to have another -ate check to go along with Celesteela, such as another Steel-type, Soundproof Mega Slowbro, or Soundproof Zygarde-C. Pokemon that check Primal Kyogre such as Dialga, Ferrothorn, and Zekrom are appreciated, as Celesteela struggles to take it on.</p>"

  "Kartana": {
    "overview": "<p>An amazing Attack stat, decent Speed, and Steel-type STAB make Kartana a fearsome Pokemon in the Balanced Hackmons metagame. Kartana's Sunsteel Strike along with Steelworker heavily limits possible switch-ins, hitting even Pokemon that resist it hard such as Registeel, Aegislash, and Primal Kyogre. It notably 2HKOes Zygarde-C and Giratina, two of the metagame's premier walls, while also bypassing Fur Coat. In addition, Sunsteel Strike OHKOes slower foes weak to it such as Xerneas, Mega Audino, and Shedinja. STAB on Sunsteel Strike as well as a decent stat spread lets Kartana also function as a Belly Drum sweeper if required due to Sunsteel Strike ignoring Fur Coat and Unaware. Its Grass typing offensively complements its Steel typing by letting it hit Water-types such as Mega Gyarados and Primal Kyogre super effectively. In addition, it makes Kartana immune to Spore, which, combined with its ability to tank common utility moves such as Core Enforcer, Revelation Dance, and Spectral Thief, grants it some degree of defensive utility. Defensively, its Steel typing as well as a decent Defense stat aids it in sweeping and wallbreaking by allowing it to take a variety of priority moves better, such as Mega Diancie's and Kyurem-B's Extreme Speed. Kartana's Speed tier also ensures it outspeeds almost every defensive Pokemon in the metagame, heavily enhancing its matchup against balance and stall teams.</p> <p>Unfortunately, its Speed tier still leaves it outsped by common offensive Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Diancie, and Mega Gengar. In addition, while switch-ins are rare, Kartana finds it difficult to OHKO defensive Pokemon that aren't weak to its attacks, such as Zygarde-C, Aegislash, and Giratina. Due to this, Kartana often relies on slow pivoting to be brought into targets that it can force out so it can wallbreak, as most of the targets it beats have ways to force it out if Kartana tries to switch in directly. Kartana also suffers from being one-dimensional, with its sets being largely limited to Belly Drum and Steelworker. Also, Kartana's abysmal special bulk, moderate physical bulk, and low Speed compared to other offensive Pokemon mean it will have difficulty against offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Tinted Lens set with moves from the Steelworker set can be used to 2HKO Steel-types such as Registeel and Celesteela. However, Kartana then does not 2HKO Giratina and Zygarde-C, and the Steelworker set needs very little prior damage in order to 2HKO Steel-types anyway while also being able to use coverage. Iron Plate can be run over Choice Band on the Steelworker set in order to ease prediction while still being a threatening wallbreaker. If Iron Plate is run, you may want to put Stealth Rock or Spikes over U-turn, as Kartana forces out many Magic Bounce users with this set. However, it can no longer 2HKO Zygarde-C or OHKO Registeel or Ferrothorn nor can it OHKO Mega Slowbro or Celesteela after Stealth Rock. Tough Claws can be run over Steelworker to boost its coverage moves, since Kartana 2HKOes Zygarde-C with Power Whip and still 2HKOes Giratina with Sunsteel Strike. However, Sunsteel Strike is less risk free, and the drop in power for Sunsteel Strike means Fur Coat variants of Zygarde-C can now wall Kartana. Choice Scarf can be used on the Steelworker set to surprise offensive Pokemon that may try to revenge Kartana. However, you lose the power of Choice Band, meaning you struggle to break defensive Pokemon down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Faster offensive threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Mewtwo X, Zekrom, and Mega Gengar can all outspeed Kartana and revenge kill it with their special attacks, or, in Mega Mewtwo X's case, its strong Close Combat. Zekrom can OHKO Kartana with Devastating Drake from its Adaptability set after very little prior damage, so Kartana must be wary of it. Zekrom can also use its bulk and typing to take Kartana's main attacks, set up on Kartana and force it out. However, these offensive threats must be wary of Belly Drum, as Kartana can then outspeed and OHKO all of them. They must also be wary of Bullet Punch, as Kartana can potentially revenge kill them with it.</p> <p><strong>Prankster Users</strong>: Prankster users such as Giratina, Aegislash, and Registeel can either use Destiny Bond to bring Kartana down, or they can use Haze to take away the boosts that Belly Drum gives.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Giratina and Zygarde-C can both take a hit and potentially status Kartana with Will-O-Wisp or Glare or remove its item if they opt to run Knock Off. However, they must be wary of Belly Drum Kartana, as Kartana is likely no longer checked by any of them after it uses Belly Drum. They must also be wary of switching into Sunsteel Strike on the Steelworker set if they are not Prankster, as they will get 2HKOed.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon can take almost any hit Kartana has to offer and OHKO back with a Fire-type STAB move. However, Primal Groudon must be wary of Kartana's Belly Drum set. If Kartana gets a Belly Drum up, Power Whip can OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Flash Fire Steel-types</strong>: Flash Fire Steel-types such as Registeel, Aegislash, and Celesteela can check every Kartana set. Flash Fire Aegislash in particular functions as an exceptional check to Kartana, due to its immunity to Fighting-type coverage. However, they must be wary of the appropriate coverage, as well as Bolt Strike on the Unburden set, as that can OHKO all of the aforementioned Steel-types.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sunsteel Strike 2HKOes defensive Pokemon such as Giratina and Zygarde-C and OHKOes many other Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar, Mega Audino, and Fur Coat Chansey after Stealth Rock. It bypasses Fur Coat on Giratina and Zygarde-C and Sturdy, allowing Kartana to use it more liberally against teams built around Shedinja. Power Whip is the Grass-type STAB move of choice to hit Water-types that may attempt to switch into Kartana, OHKOing Primal Kyogre and Mega Gyarados and OHKOing Mega Slowbro after Stealth Rock. In addition, Power Whip 2HKOes Primal Groudon, which would otherwise comfortably switch into Kartana. Bolt Strike can be run over Power Whip, as, while it requires Stealth Rock support and prior damage to OHKO Mega Slowbro, it has the benefit of OHKOing Celesteela, which can especially be useful against Flash Fire variants. Thousand Arrows can be run to cover every Steel-type Pokemon in the tier besides Ferrothorn, which gets worn down anyway. However, it is weak and won't do much damage to neutral targets. V-create is used to OHKO Steel-types such as Registeel, Aegislash, and Magearna. It also has the benefit of OHKOing any Imposter Pokemon that attempts to switch into Kartana, but it can force Kartana out due to the stat drops. Close Combat can be run to 2HKO Flash Fire Steel-types such as Registeel and Ferrothorn, but it does not 2HKO Imposter Chansey switch-ins and cannot hit Aegislash. Precipice Blades can be used to OHKO Aegislash after minimal prior damage but does not 2HKO Ferrothorn or Imposter Chansey switch-ins and cannot hit Celesteela. Bullet Punch can be used to OHKO Mega Diancie and pick off weakened offensive foes that may attempt to stay in and KO Kartana, such as Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y. Trick can be used to ease prediction while potentially crippling a defensive Pokemon or a specially oriented Pokemon. However, Kartana loses an incredible amount of power if it loses Choice Band, failing to 2HKO Giratina and Zygarde-C. U-turn can be used to pivot on switches Kartana may force, such as against Mega Audino, Xerneas, and Mega Gyarados. However, Kartana will generally 2HKO the switch-in with Sunsteel Strike or the correct coverage move anyway, so U-turn is not often needed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Steelworker boosts Kartana's Sunsteel Strike and Bullet Punch to incredible power levels, allowing Kartana to 2HKO Zygarde-C and Giratina with the former while also helping Kartana pick off weakened offensive Pokemon more easily. Choice Band allows Kartana to 2HKO Zygarde-C and Giratina in conjunction with Steelworker as well as OHKO Mega Slowbro after Stealth Rock, OHKO Celesteela with Bolt Strike and OHKO Imposter Pokemon that may want to switch into it with V-create. An Adamant nature is used to ensure a 2HKO on Zygarde-C while improving Kartana's ability to wallbreak. The Speed boost from a Jolly nature is not required, as it is only useful for beating Mega Kangaskhan, a threat Kartana can take on regardless.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use slow pivoting to bring Kartana in on targets it can force out such as Kyurem-B, Shedinja, and Xerneas. Don't use Sunsteel Strike liberally unless it is safe to do so, as it only has 8 PP and is vulnerable to being PP stalled out. Be sure to scout for Prankster Pokemon such as Registeel, Giratina, and Zygarde-C. Physically bulky and Steel-resistant Prankster Pokemon can PP stall Kartana's Sunsteel Strike if they come on it, meaning you may need to predict their switch correctly to get the most out of Kartana. Alternatively, make sure you deal with any Prankster Pokemon beforehand so Kartana can freely wallbreak. Keep in mind Kartana is not made to take on offensive Pokemon, so staying in on one is unwise, especially if it's specially offensive, as Kartana's Special Defense is poor. Make sure to scout for status moves, as Kartana needs both its decent Speed stat and its colossal Attack stat to function well and being burned or paralyzed can give it difficulty. Being burned in particular can make Kartana useless as a wallbreaker, as it no longer attains many of the OHKOs and 2HKOs it wishes to get. Use Trick when you would like to lock a defensive Pokemon into a move or when you wish to be able to switch moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Mewtwo Y appreciates Kartana's ability to break down the opponent's defensive Pokemon. In return, with its Sheer Force sets, Mega Mewtwo Y has a good matchup against many of the offensive Pokemon in the tier that may threaten Kartana. A solid defensive core with checks to fast Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Mega Diancie, and Mega Mewtwo X can be very useful, as Kartana is forced out by them. Flash Fire Steel-types, such as Celesteela and Registeel, can help wall Mega Diancie while also being able to Imposter-proof Kartana and provide slow pivoting. Bulky Psychic-types such as Mega Slowbro and Cresselia can also help check Mega Mewtwo X for Kartana. Poison Heal Pokemon, such as Regigigas, Primal Kyogre, and Xerneas are appreciated due to their ability to scout status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Glare. They are also able to switch in on Knock Off, which is very beneficial, as Kartana requires Choice Band to be a threatening wallbreaker. In addition, they can force switches and put opposing Pokemon to sleep, granting Kartana more opportunities to come in. In return, Kartana can break walls down for them, which helps them sweep. Imposter Chansey is appreciated due to its ability to scout for Fur Coat on Pokemon that resist Sunsteel Strike, such as Mega Slowbro. This can help determine if Kartana can use a coverage move or if it needs to use Sunsteel Strike. Imposter Chansey can also scout for Flash Fire Steel-types if Kartana opts to run V-create, as well as for common utility moves that Kartana may dislike having to take such as Knock Off, Will-O-Wisp, and Glare, and it has a good matchup against the faster Pokemon that threaten Kartana. Choice Scarf Imposter Chansey in particular can reliably beat many offensive threats, even after setup. In return, Kartana can weaken opposing Pokemon meant to Imposter-proof another threat on the team, which can help facilitate an Imposter sweep. If Kartana opts to run Trick, putting a Z-Move on the Pokemon meant to Imposter-proof Kartana is a good idea, protecting them against opposing Trick. Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Gyarados can be used in order to switch into Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Blaziken.</p>"

      "Belly Drum Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum is used to maximize Kartana's Attack while also putting it in range of Sitrus Berry, activating Unburden. Sunsteel Strike is Kartana's primary STAB move, bypassing Unaware and Fur Coat to help Kartana sweep. After Belly Drum, it OHKOes every Pokemon that does not resist it except for Zygarde-C 50% of the time. Close Combat is used to hit Steel-types, including Flash Fire ones, which Fire-type coverage can't hit. It also has the benefit of OHKOing Kartana's Imposter after a Belly Drum and Stealth Rock, ensuring that Imposter cannot pull off a reverse sweep. However, it misses covering Aegislash, which can potentially stop a sweep. Sacred Fire is used to hit non-Flash Fire Steel-types while still OHKOing Kartana's Imposter. However, Close Combat is generally better, and Sacred Fire should only be used if your team lacks ways of dealing with -ate users, as the defense drops from Close Combat make Kartana more susceptible to their Extreme Speed. Power Whip is used to guarantee an OHKO versus Primal Kyogre, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Gyarados. Bolt Strike can be used over Power Whip to OHKO Celesteela while OHKOing all of the aforementioned targets, especially Flash Fire Aegislash. However, if Kartana needs to attack prior to using Belly Drum, Bolt Strike sacrifices a crucial amount of power. In addition, after a Belly Drum, Close Combat OHKOes Celesteela anyway, so Bolt Strike should only be used when your team lacks Stealth Rock and Kartana is using Sacred Fire. Icicle Crash can be used to guarantee the OHKO on Zygarde-C, but Kartana heavily prefers being able to OHKO Mega Slowbro and OHKOes Zygarde-C with Sunsteel Strike after one layer of Spikes anyway. Horn Leech can be used over Power Whip to grant some sustainability as well as more reliable accuracy, but Power Whip's power is more useful so Kartana can break down more Pokemon before Belly Drum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unburden allows Kartana to defeat Imposter Pokemon that attempt to transform into it, as it outspeeds even Choice Scarf variants after Unburden activates. Unburden also gives Kartana a better matchup against offensive Pokemon by making it more difficult to revenge kill. Sitrus Berry is the best item for Kartana on a Belly Drum set, as it activates after a Belly Drum and thus activates Unburden. An Adamant nature is used in order to help Kartana's offensive power, as Kartana outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame after Unburden activates regardless of nature. If Kartana elects to run Close Combat, running 124 Defense EVs is an option so that it doesn't need Stealth Rock to OHKO Imposter Chansey.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Look for Prankster Pokemon, such as Registeel, Zygarde-C, and Giratina on the opponent's team and deal with them early on. If a Prankster Pokemon is not taken early on, it may neuter Kartana's ability to sweep. Make sure to deal with Flash Fire Aegislash prior to sweeping if you are not running Bolt Strike, as it can neuter Kartana's ability to sweep. Do your best to get entry hazards up prior to setting up with Kartana, as they help facilitate a sweep due to the extra damage being useful on targets such as Zygarde-C and Celesteela while also breaking Focus Sash. Try to make sure that your opponent's -ate Mega Charizard Y or Kyurem-Black either lack Fake Out or aren't Triage, in Mega Charizard Y's case. These are the only two ways the aforementioned Pokemon can stop a Kartana sweep, so it is important to deal with them beforehand. Try not to set up on slower Pokemon that have Spectral Thief or Core Enforcer. Spectral Thief can steal Kartana's boosts as it tries to set up, and it will be unable to set up again. Core Enforcer can suppress Unburden, allowing Imposter Pokemon to beat Kartana and allowing other offensive Pokemon to beat it. Kartana only has one chance to set up and sweep, so you should not click Belly Drum until you are sure that Kartana can secure a sweep. Bluffing Kartana's Choice Band set by coming in on Mega Sableye can grant Kartana a setup opportunity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Mega Diancie and Mega Mewtwo X can eliminate Prankster Pokemon for Kartana and wear down potential defensive checks. Mega Diancie can also function as entry hazard support for Kartana, helping facilitate its sweep. Other Pokemon that provide entry hazard support include Zygarde-C, Ferrothorn, and Yveltal. Imposter can be useful to scout for Prankster Pokemon as well as Flash Fire Pokemon if Kartana has Sacred Fire. A backup Pokemon that Imposter-proofs Kartana after it is set up can be useful, in case Unburden is somehow removed or suppressed. Prankster Pokemon such as Giratina, Zygarde-C, and Aegislash will generally do the job. Pokemon that check -ate users such as Flash Fire Steel-types can be useful in order to cripple -ate users or slowly defeat them. Triage Mega Charizard Y can be used to pressure and defeat opposing Prankster Pokemon, helping Kartana sweep.</p>"
