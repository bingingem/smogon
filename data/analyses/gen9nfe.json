  "Gabite": {
    "overview": "<p>Gabite uses its powerful Dragon and Ground typing in conjunction with Swords Dance to become a potentially devastating setup sweeper in the NFE metagame. Sitting at a comfortable speed tier ahead of other offensive threats like Monferno and Thwackey, Gabite is a solid choice for teams that need a powerful wallbreaker and setup option. On top of this, Gabite can establish Stealth Rock for its team and use its Ground typing to absorb paralysis attempts from the likes of Hattrem and Tinkatuff. While these traits are quite tantalizing, Gabite does suffer from having poor matchups into other NFE staples like Misdreavus, which can threaten to burn Gabite with Will-O-Wisp, and Piloswine, which can revenge kill Gabite with Ice Shard after minor chip damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Scale Shot can be used to provide a Speed boost, helping outpace Frogadier, Girafarig, and Misdreavus, though it does mean Gabite is much less threatening offensively, as it relies on the multi-hit nature of the move. Similarly, Gabite can opt for a fully offensive set, using a Choice Scarf to outspeed the aforementioned Pokemon without needing to rely on Scale Shot and coverage moves like Iron Head to hit Fairy-types harder, like Clefairy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Gabite is slower than notable revenge killers like Drakloak and Frogadier, both of which can threaten an OHKO with Draco Meteor and Ice Beam, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Piloswine</strong>: Piloswine's Ice Shard threatens an OHKO after Gabite takes minor chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Misdreavus</strong>: Misdreavus can outpace Gabite with ease, thus threatening a Will-O-Wisp to neutralize Gabite offensively.</p> <p><strong>Dunsparce</strong>: Dunsparce is quite difficult for Gabite to break through and can use Ice Beam to threaten an OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Wartortle</strong>: Wartortle can be problematic for Gabite, as it can use the threat of Ice Beam to get a free Shell Smash opportunity.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Gabite is a solid choice as an offensive setup option that also offers excellent utility in Stealth Rock and its Ground typing, which helps against notable entry hazard setters like Koffing and Tinkatuff. Substitute can be used to block status attempts from slower foes like Body Slam Dunsparce and Will-O-Wisp Koffing, allowing Gabite to use Swords Dance more freely; alternatively, Gabite can use Stealth Rock to free up a moveslot for teammates like Dunsparce and Tinkatuff. The given EV spread maximizes its damage output, with Adamant granting more immediate wallbreaking power at the expense of being slower than Monferno and Thwackey.</p> <p>Gabite is a fine addition to many team structures, notably finding a role on balance and bulky offense teams as an offensive setup sweeper and wallbreaker. While Gabite can use its Ground typing to find setup opportunities against common foes like Koffing, Monferno, and Tinkatuff, it struggles with capitalizing on its boosts with the abundance of threats that can OHKO it, like Drakloak, Frogadier, and Piloswine. Teammates like Tinkatuff can help handle these threats by providing Knock Off support while sponging attacks from Drakloak and Frogadier. Quaxwell can also help handle them by providing slow pivots with Flip Turn, entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin, and it can take hits from Frogadier. Misdreavus makes an excellent partner too, as it can threaten Will-O-Wisp on Piloswine to limit the damage output of Ice Shard while acting as a spinblocker against opposing Quaxwell. Ivysaur, Monferno, and Pignite are fine teammates for Gabite as well, offering Knock Off support to help remove Eviolite from physical walls, like opposing Ivysaur and Vullaby, to make wallbreaking easier for Gabite. Paralysis spreaders like Dunsparce, Misdreavus, and Tinkatuff can enable Gabite offensively, allowing it to use Substitute to set up against paralyzed foes a bit more safely. Frogadier, as a partner to Stealth Rock Gabite, can create powerful hazard-stacking cores with Misdreavus as the spinblocker. Girafarig and Vigoroth are great teammates to help Gabite get through Misdreavus, with Girafarig providing a special wallbreaker to go with Gabite's physical wallbreaking. Raboot can help Gabite set up by providing safe entry points against common switch-ins like Koffing.</p>"
